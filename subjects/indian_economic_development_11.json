However , it\nis equally  important to know something\nabout the country’s economic past even\nas you learn about its present state and\nfuture prospects. So, let us first look at\nthe state of India’s economy prior to the\ncountry’s independence and form an\nidea of the various considerations that\nshaped India’ s  post- independence\ndevelopment  strategy.\nThe structure of India’s present-\nday economy is not just of current\nmaking; it has its roots steeped in\nhistory, particularly in the period when\nIndia was under British rule which\nlasted for almost two centuries before\nIndia finally won its independence on\n15 August  1947.  The sole purpose  of\nthe British  colonial  rule in\n India  was\nto reduce  the country  to being  a raw\nmaterial supplier for  Great  Britain’sown rapidly expanding modern\nindustrial base. An understanding of\nthe exploitative nature of this\nrelationship is essential for any\nassessment of the kind and level of\ndevelopment  which the Indian\neconomy has been able to attain over\nthe last s even and half  decades. 1.2\n1.2 LOW LEVEL OF ECONOMIC\nDEVELOPMENT UNDER THE\nCOLONIAL  RULE\nIndia had an independent economy\nbefore the advent of the British rule.\nThough agriculture was the main\nsource of livelihood for most people,\nyet, the country’s economy was\ncharacterised by various kinds of\nmanufacturing activities. India was\nparticularly well known for its\nhandicraft industries in the fields of\ncotton and silk textiles, metal and\nprecious stone works etc. These\nproducts enjoyed a worldwide market\nbased on the reputation of the fine\nquality of material used and the high\nstandards of craftsmanship seen in all\nimports from India  (See Box 1.1).“India is the pivot of our Empire... If the Empire loses any other part of its\nDominion we can survive, but if we lose India, the sun of our Empire will have\nset.”\nVictor Alexander Vruce, the Viceroy of British India in 1894\nBox 1.1: Textile Industry in Bengal\nMuslin is a type of cotton textile which had its origin in Bengal, particularly,\nplaces in and around Dhaka (spelled during the pre-independence period as\nDacca),  now  the capital city of  Bangladesh. ‘Daccai Muslin’ had gained worldwide\nfame as an exquisite type of  cotton textile. The finest variety of muslin was\ncalled malmal . Sometimes, foreign travellers also used to refer to it as malmal\nshahi  or malmal khas implying that it was wor n by, or fit for , the royalty.\n2024-25"

Such policies brought about\na fundamental change in the structure\nof the Indian economy — transforming\nthe country into supplier of raw\nmaterials and consumer of finished\nindustrial products from Britain.\nObviously, the colonial govern -\nment never made any sincere\nattempt to estimate India’s  national\nand per capita income .

It pr oduces\namply — for its own consumption —\nwheat, vegetables, grains, fowls, ducks\nand geese. It has immense herds of pigs\nand flocks of sheep and goats.

Agricultural\npro-ductivity  became low though , in\nabsolute terms , the sector experienced\nsome growth due to the expansion of\nthe aggregate area under cultivation.\nThis stagnation in the agricultural\nsector was caused mainly because of\nthe various  systems of land\nsettlement that were introduced by\nthe colonial government.  Particularly,\nunder the zamindari  system which\nwas implemented in the then Bengal\nPresidency comprising parts of\nIndia’s present-day eastern states,\nthe profit accruing out of the\nagriculture sector went to the\nzamindars  instead of the cultivators.\nHowever , a considerable number of\nzamindars,  and not just the colonial\ngovernment, did nothing to improve\nthe condition of agriculture.

Despite\nsome progress made in irrigation,\nIndia’s agriculture was starved of\ninvestment in terracing, flood-control,\ndrainage and desalinisation of soil.\nWhile a small section of farmers\nchanged their cropping pattern from\nfood crops to commercial crops, a large\nsection of tenants, small farmers and\nsharecroppers neither had resources\nand technology nor had incentive to\ninvest in agriculure.\n1.4 I NDUSTRIAL  SECTOR\nAs in the case of agriculture, so also\nin manufacturing, India could not\ndevelop a sound industrial base under\nthe colonial rule. Even as the country’s\nworld famous handicraft industries\ndeclined, no corresponding modern\nindustrial base was allowed to come\nup to take pride of place so long\nenjoyed by the for mer. The primary\nmotive of the colonial government\nbehind this policy of systematically de-\nindustrialising India was two-fold. The\nintention was, first, to reduce India to\nthe status of a mere exporter of\nimportant raw materials for the\nupcoming modern industries in\nBritain and, second, to turn India into\na sprawling market for the finished\nproducts of those industries so that\ntheir continued expansion could be\nensured to the maximum advantage oftheir home country  — Britain. In the\nunfolding economic scenario, the\ndecline of the indigenous handicraft\nindustries created not only massive\nunemployment in India but also a new\ndemand in the Indian consumer\nmarket, which was now deprived of the\nsupply of locally made goods. This\ndemand was profitably met by the\nincreasing imports of cheap\nmanufactured goods from Britain.\nDuring the second half of the\nnineteenth century, modern industry\nbegan to take root in India but its\nprogress remained very slow.\nInitially, this development was\nconfined to the setting up of cotton\nand jute textile mills. The cotton\ntextile mills, mainly dominated by\nIndians, were located in the western\nparts of the country, namely,\nMaharashtra and Gujarat, while\nthe jute mills dominated by  the\nforeigners were mainly concentrated\nin Bengal. Subsequently, the iron\nand steel industries began coming up\nin the beginning of the twentieth\ncentury. The Tata Iron and Steel\nCompany (TISCO) was incorporated\nin 1907. A few other industries in the\nfields of sugar , cement, paper etc.\ncame up after  the Second W orld W ar.\nHowever , ther e was har dly any\ncapital goods industry  to help\npromote further industrialisation in\nIndia.

Another\nsignificant drawback of the new\nindustrial sector was the very limited\narea of operation of the public sector.\nThis sector remained confined only to\nthe railways, power generation,\ncommunications, ports and some\nother departmental undertakings.\n1.5 F OREIGN  TRADE\nIndia has been an important trading\nnation since ancient times. But the\nrestrictive policies of commodity\nproduction, trade and tariff pursued\nby the colonial government adversely\naffected the structure, composition and\nvolume of India’s foreign trade.\nConsequently, India became anexporter of primary products such as\nraw silk, cotton, wool, sugar, indigo,\njute etc. and an importer of finished\nconsumer goods like cotton, silk and\nwoollen clothes and capital goods like\nlight machinery produced in the\nfactories of Britain. For all practical\npurposes, Britain maintained a\nmonopoly control over India’s exports\nand imports.  As a result, more than\nhalf of India’s foreign trade was\nrestricted to Britain while the rest was\nallowed with a few other countries like\nChina, Ceylon (Sri Lanka) and Persia\n(Iran). The opening of the Suez Canal\nfurther intensified British control over\nIndia’s foreign trade (see Box 1.3).\nThe most important characteristic\nof India’s foreign trade throughout the\ncolonial period was the generation of\na large export surplus.

Finally we were\nmasters of our own destiny after\nsome two hundred years of British\nrule; the job of nation building was\nnow in our own hands.  The leaders\nof independent India had to decide,\namong other things, the type of\neconomic system  most suitable for\nour nation, a system which would\npromote the welfare of all rather than\na few.  There are different types of\neconomic systems (see Box 2.1) and\namong them, socialism appealed to\nJawaharlal Nehru the most. However ,\nhe was not in favour of the kind of\nsocialism established in the former\nSoviet Union where all the means of\nproduction, i.e. all the factories and\nfarms in the country, were owned by\nthe government. There was no private\nproperty. It is not possible in a\ndemocracy like India for the\ngovernment to change the ownership\npattern of land and other properties\nof its citizens in the way that it was\ndone in the former Soviet Union.\nNehru, and many other leaders and\nthinkers of the newly  independent\nIndia, sought an alternative to the\nextreme versions of capitalism and\nsocialism. Basically sympathising with\nthe socialist outlook, they found theanswer in an economic system which,\nin their view, combined the best\nfeatures of socialism without its\ndrawbacks. In this view,  India would\nbe a socialist society with a strong\npublic sector but also with private\nproperty and democracy; the government\nwould plan (see Box 2.2) for theThe central objective of Planning in India... is to initiate a process of\ndevelopment which will raise the living standards and open out to the people\nnew opportunities for a richer and more varied life.\nFirst Five Year Plan\nWork These Out\nØPrepare a chart on the\ndifferent types of economic\nsystems prevalent in the\nworld.

                "text": "18 INDIAN ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTBox 2.1: Types of Economic Systems\nEvery society has to answer three questions\nØWhat goods and services should be produced in the country?\nØHow should the goods and services be produced? Should producers use\nmore human labour or more capital (machines) for producing things?\nØHow should the goods and services be distributed among people?\nOne answer to these questions is to depend on the market forces  of\nsupply and demand. In a market economy, also called capitalism, only those\nconsumer goods will be produced that are in demand, i.e., goods that can\nbe sold profitably either in the domestic or in the foreign markets. If cars\nare in demand, cars will be produced and if bicycles are in demand, bicycles\nwill be pr oduced. If labour is cheaper than capital, mor e labour -intensive\nmethods of production will be used and vice-versa. In a capitalist society\nthe goods produced are distributed among people not on the basis of what\npeople need but on the basis of Purchasing Power—the ability to buy goods\nand services. That is, one has to have the money in the pocket to buy it. Low\ncost housing for the poor is much needed but will not count as demand in\nthe market sense because the poor do not have the purchasing power to\nback the demand. As a result this commodity will not be produced and\nsupplied as per market forces. Such a society did not appeal to Jawaharlal\nNehru, our first prime minister , for it meant that the gr eat majority of people\nof the country would be left behind without the chance to improve their\nquality of life.\nA socialist  society answers the three questions in a totally different\nmanner . In a socialist society the gover nment decides what goods ar e to be\nproduced in accordance with the needs of society. It is assumed that the\ngovernment knows what is good for the people of the country and so the\ndesires of individual consumers are not given much importance. The\ngovernment decides how goods are to be produced and how they should be\ndistributed. In principle, distribution under socialism is supposed to be based\non what people need and not on what they can afford to purchase. Unlike\nunder capitalism, for example, a socialist nation provides free health care\nto all its citizens.  Strictly, a socialist society has no private property since\neverything is owned by the state. In Cuba and China, for example, most of\nthe economic activities are governed by the socialistic principles.\nMost economies are mixed economies, i.e. the government and the\nmarket together answer the three questions of what to produce, how to\nproduce and how to distribute what is produced. In a mixed economy, the\nmarket will provide whatever goods and services it can produce well, and\nthe government will provide essential goods and services which the market\nfails to do.\n2024-25"

In 1950, the Planning\nCommission  was set up with the\nPrime Minister as its Chairperson. The\nera of five year plans had begun.\n2.2 T HE GOALS OF FIVE YEAR PLANS\nA plan should have some clearly\nspecified goals.  The goals of the five\nyear plans were: growth, modernisation,\nself-reliance and equity. This does not\nmean that all the plans have  given\nequal importance to all these goals.\nDue to limited resources, a choice has\nto be made in each plan about whichof the goals is to be given primary\nimportance. Nevertheless, the planners\nhave to ensure that, as far as possible,\nthe policies of the plans do not\ncontradict these four goals. Let us now\nlearn about the goals of planning in\nsome detail.\nGrowth: It refers to increase in the\ncountry’s capacity to produce the\noutput of goods and services within\nthe country. It implies either a\nlarger stock of productive capital,\nor a larger size of supporting\nservices like transport and\nbanking, or an increase in the\nefficiency of productive capital and\nservices. A good indicator of\neconomic growth,  in the language ofBox 2.2: What is a Plan?\nA plan spells out how the resources of a nation should be put to use. It\nshould have some general goals as well as specific objectives which are to\nbe achieved within a specified period of time; in India plans were of five\nyears duration and were called five year plans (we borrowed this from the\nformer Soviet Union, the pioneer in national planning). Our plan documents\nupto the year 2017 not only specify the objectives to be attained in the five\nyears of a plan but also what is to be achieved over a period of twenty years.\nThis long-term plan is called ‘perspective plan’. The five year plans were\nsupposed to provide the basis for the perspective plan.\nIt will be unrealistic to expect all the goals of a plan to be given equal\nimportance in all the plans. In fact the goals may actually be in conflict. For\nexample, the goal of introducing modern technology may be in conflict with\nthe goal of increasing employment if the technology reduces the need for\nlabour . The planners have to balance the goals, a very dif ficult job indeed.\nWe find different goals being emphasised in different plans in India.\nIndia’s five year plans did not spell out how much of each and every\ngood and service is to be produced. This is neither possible nor necessary\n(the former Soviet Union tried to do this and failed). It is enough if the plan\nis specific about the sectors where it plays a commanding role, for instance,\npower generation and irrigation, while leaving the rest to the market.\n2024-25"

Among them, the name of the statistician, Prasanta Chandra\nMahalanobis, stands out.\nPlanning, in the r eal sense of the ter m, began with the Second Five Y ear\nPlan. The Second Plan, a landmark contribution to development planning\nin general, laid down the basic ideas regarding\ngoals of Indian planning; this plan was based\non the ideas of Mahalanobis. In that sense, he\ncan be regarded as the architect of Indian\nplanning.\nMahalanobis was born in 1893 in Calcutta.\nHe was educated at the Presidency College in\nCalcutta and at Cambridge University in\nEngland. His contributions to the subject of\nstatistics brought him international fame. In\n1945 he was made a Fellow (member) of\nBritain’s Royal Society, one of the most\nprestigious organisations of scientists; only the\nmost outstanding scientists are made\nmembers of this Society.\nMahalanobis established the Indian\nStatistical Institute (ISI) in Calcutta and\nstarted a journal, Sankhya,  which still serves\nas a respected forum for statisticians  to\ndiscuss their ideas. Both, the ISI and Sankhya, are highly regarded by\nstatisticians and economists all over the world to this day.\nDuring the second plan period, Mahalanobis invited many\ndistinguished economists from India and abroad to advise him on India’s\neconomic development. Some of these economists became Nobel Prize winners\nlater, which shows that he could identify individuals with talent. Among\nthe economists invited by Mahalanobis were those who were very critical of\nthe socialist principles of the second plan. In other words, he was willing to\nlisten to what his critics had to say, the mark of a gr eat scholar .\nMany economists today reject the approach to planning formulated by\nMahalanobis but he will always be remembered for playing a vital role in\nputting India on the road to economic progress, and statisticians continue\nto profit from his contribution to statistical theory.\nSource: Sukhamoy Chakravarty, ‘Mahalanobis, Prasanta Chandra’ in John\nEatwell et.al, (Eds.)

The\nGDP is the market value of all the\nfinal goods and services produced in\nthe country during a year . You have\nstudied this concept in Class X as\nwell. Y ou can think of the GDP as a\ncake and growth is increase in the\nsize of the cake. If the cake is lar ger,\nmore people can enjoy it. It is\nnecessary to produce more goods\nand services if the people of India are\nto enjoy  (in the words of the First Five\nYear Plan) a mor e rich and varied life.\nThe GDP of a country is derived\nfrom the different sectors of the\neconomy, namely the agricultural\nsector , the industrial sector and the\nservice sector . The contribution\nmade by each of these sectors makes\nup the structural composition of\nthe economy.  In some countries,\ngrowth in agriculture contributes\nmore to the GDP growth, while in\nsome countries the growth in the\nservice sector contributes more to\nGDP growth (see Box 2.4).\nModernisation: To increase the\nproduction of goods and servicesthe producers have to adopt new\ntechnology. For example, a farmer can\nincrease the output on the farm by\nusing new seed varieties instead of\nusing the old ones. Similarly, a factory\ncan increase output by using a new\ntype of machine. Adoption of new\ntechnology is called modernisation.\nHowever , moder nisation does not\nrefer only to the use of new technology\nbut also to changes in social outlook\nsuch as the recognition that women\nshould have the same rights as men.  In\na traditional society, women are\nsupposed to remain at home while men\nwork. A modern society makes use of\nthe talents of women in the work place\n— in banks, factories, schools etc. —\nand such a society in most occassions\nis also prosperous.\nSelf-reliance: A nation can promote\neconomic growth and modernisation\nby using its own resources or by\nusing resources imported from other\nnations. The first seven five year plans\ngave importance to self-reliance\nwhich means avoiding imports\nof those goods which could beBox 2.4: The Service Sector\nAs a country develops, it undergoes ‘structural change’. In the case of India,\nthe structural change is peculiar . Usually, with development, the shar e of\nagriculture declines and the share of industry becomes dominant. At higher\nlevels of development, the service sector contributes more to the GDP than the\nother two sectors. In India, the share of agriculture in the GDP was more than\n50 per cen t—as we would expect for a poor country. But by 1990 the share of\nthe service sector was 40.59 per cent, more than that of agriculture or industry,\nlike what we find in developed nations. This phenomenon of growing share of\nthe service sector was accelerated in the post 1991 period (this marked the\nonset of globalisation in the country which will be discussed in chapter 3).\n2024-25"

The low productivity of\nthe agricultural sector forced India to\nimport food from the United States of\nAmerica (U.S.A.).  Equity in  agriculture\ncalled for land reforms  which primarily\nrefer to change in the ownership of\nlandholdings. Just a year after\nindependence, steps were taken to\nabolish intermediaries and to make the\ntillers the owners of land. The idea\nbehind this move was that ownership\nof land would give incentives (see Box\n2.5) to the tillers to invest in making\nimprovements provided sufficient\ncapital was made available to them.Land ceiling  was another policy to\npromote equity in the agricultural\nsector . This means fixing the maximum\nsize of land which could be owned by\nan individual. The purpose of land\nceiling was to reduce the concentration\nof land ownership in a few hands.\nThe abolition of intermediaries\nmeant that  some 200 lakh tenants\ncame into direct contact with the\ngovernment  — they were thus\nfreed from being exploited by the\nzamindars . The ownership conferred\non tenants gave them the incentive to\nincrease output and this contributed\nto growth in agricultur e. However , the\ngoal of equity was not fully served\nby abolition of intermediaries.  In\nsome areas the former zamindarsBox 2.5: Ownership and Incentives\nThe policy of ‘land to the tiller’  is based on the idea that the cultivators will\ntake more interes t—they will have more incentiv e—in increasing output if\nthey are the owners of the land. This is because ownership of land enables the\ntiller to make profit from the increased output. Tenants do not have the incentive\nto make improvements on land since it is the landowner who would benefit\nmore from higher output. The importance of ownership in providing incentives\nis well illustrated by the carelessness with which farmers in the former Soviet\nUnion used to pack fruits for sale. It was not uncommon to see farmers packing\nrotten fruits along with fresh fruits in the same box. Now, every farmer knows\nthat the r otten fruits will spoil the fr esh fruits if they ar e packed together . This\nwill be a loss to the farmer since the fruits cannot be sold. So why did the\nSoviet farmers do something which would so obviously result in loss for them?\nThe answer lies in the incentives facing the farmers. Since farmers in the\nformer Soviet Union did not own any land, they neither enjoyed the profits nor\nsuffered the losses. In the absence of ownership, there was no incentive on\nthe part of farmers to be efficient, which also explains the poor performance of\nthe agricultural sector in the Soviet Union despite availability of vast areas of\nhighly fertile land.\nSource:  Thomas Sowell, Basic Economics: A Citizen’s Guide to the Economy,\nNew Y ork: Basic Books, 2004, Second Edition.\n2024-25"

The big landlords\nchallenged the legislation in the\ncourts, delaying its implementation.\nThey used this delay to register their\nlands in the name of close relatives,\nthereby escaping from the\nlegislation.

Unfortunately\nother states did not have the same\nlevel of commitment and vast\ninequality in landholding continues\nto this day.\nThe Green Revolution: At\nindependence, about 75 per cent of\nthe country’s population was\ndependent on agriculture.\nProductivity in the agricultural sector\nwas very low because of the use of old\ntechnology and the absence of\nrequired infrastructure for the vast\nmajority of farmers. India’s\nagriculture vitally depends on themonsoon and if the monsoon fell short\nthe farmers were in trouble unless\nthey had access to irrigation facilities\nwhich very few had. The stagnation in\nagriculture during the colonial rule\nwas permanently broken by the green\nrevolution . This refers to the large\nincrease in production of food grains\nresulting from the use of high yielding\nvariety (HYV) seeds  especially for\nwheat and rice.  The use of these seeds\nrequired the use of fertiliser and\npesticide in the correct quantities as\nwell as regular supply of water; the\napplication of these inputs in correct\nproportions is vital. The farmers who\ncould benefit from HYV seeds required\nreliable irrigation facilities as well as\nthe financial resources to purchase\nfertiliser and pesticide. As a result, in\nthe first phase of the green revolution\n(approximately mid 1960s upto mid\n1970s), the use of HYV seeds was\nrestricted to the more affluent states\nsuch as Punjab, Andhra Pradesh and\nTamil Nadu.

The\nportion of agricultural produce which\nis sold in the market by the farmers\nis called marketed surplus .  A good\nproportion of the  rice and wheat\nproduced during  the green revolution\nperiod  (available as marketed\nsurplus) was sold by the farmers in\nthe market.

The government\nprovided loans at a low interest rate\nto small farmers and subsidised\nfertili sers so that small farmers could\nalso have access to the needed\ninputs. Since the small farmers could\nobtain the required inputs, the\noutput on small farms equal led the\noutput on large farms in the  course\nof time. As a result, the green\nrevolution benefited the small as well\nas rich farmers.  The risk of the small\nfarmers being ruined when pests\nattack their crops was considerably\nreduced by the services rendered by\nresearch institutes established by the\ngover nment. Y ou should note that\nthe green revolution would have\nfavoured the rich farmers only if the\nstate did not play an extensive role\nin ensuring that the small farmer\nalso gains fr om the new technology.\nThe Debate Over Subsidies: The\neconomic justification of subsidies in\nagriculture is, at present, a hotly\ndebated question. It is generally\nagreed that it was necessary to use\nsubsidies to provide an incentive for\nadoption of the new HYV technology\nby farmers in general and small\nfarmers in particular . Any new\ntechnology will be looked upon as\nbeing risky by farmers. Subsidies\nwere, therefore, needed to encourage\nfarmers to test the new technology.\nSome economists believe that once\nthe technology is found profitable\nand is widely adopted, subsidiesshould be phased out since their\npurpose has been served. Further ,\nsubsidies are meant to benefit the\nfarmers but a substantial amount of\nfertili ser subsid y also benefits the\nfertili ser industry; and among\nfarmers, the subsidy largely benefits\nthe farmers in the more prosperous\nregions. Therefore , it is argued that\nthere is no case for continuing with\nfertili ser subsidies ; it does not benefit\nthe target group and it is a huge\nburden on the government’s finances\n(see also Box 2.6).\nOn the other hand, some believe\nthat the government should continue\nwith agricultural subsidies because\nfarming in India continues to be a risky\nbusiness. Most farmers are very poor\nand they will not be able to afford the\nrequired inputs without subsidies.\nEliminating subsidies will increase the\ninequality between rich and poor\nfarmers and violate the goal of equity.\nThese experts argue that if subsidies\nare largely benefiting the fertiliser\nindustry and big farmers, the correct\npolicy is not to abolish subsidies but\nto take steps to ensure that only the\npoor farmers enjoy the benefits.\nThus, by the late 1960s, Indian\nagricultural productivity had increased\nsufficiently to enable the country to be\nself-sufficient in food grains.  This is an\nachievement to be proud of. On the\nnegative side, some 65 per cent of the\ncountry’s population continued to be\nemployed in agriculture even as late as\n1990.

In India,\nbetween 1950 and 1990, the\nproportion of GDP contributed by\nagriculture declined significantly but\nnot the population depending on it\n(67.5 per cent in 1950 to 64.9 per cent\nby 1990). Why was such a large\nproportion of the population engaged\nin agriculture although agricultural\noutput could have grown with much\nless people working in the sector?

Industry\nprovides employment which is more\nstable than the employment in\nagriculture ; it promotes  modernisation\nand overall  prosperity. It is for this\nreason that the five year plans place d\na lot of emphasis on industrial\ndevelopment. Y ou might have\nstudied in the previous chapter that,\nat the time of independence, the\nvariety of industries was very narrowBox 2.6: Prices as Signals\nYou would have lear nt in an earlier class about how prices of goods ar e\ndetermined in the market. It is important to understand that prices are signals\nabout the availability of goods. If a good becomes scarce, its price will rise and\nthose who use this good will have the incentive to make efficient decisions\nabout its use based on the price.  If the price of water goes up because of lower\nsupply, people will have the incentive to use it with greater care; for example,\nthey may stop watering the gar den to conserve water . We complain whenever\nthe price of petrol increases and blame it on the government. But the increase\nin petrol price reflects greater scarcity and the price rise is a signal that less\npetrol is availabl e—this provides an incentive to use less petrol or look for\nalternate fuels.\nSome economists point out that subsidies do not allow prices to indicate\nthe supply of a good. When electricity and water are provided at a subsidised\nrate or free, they will be used wastefully without any concern for their scarcity.\nFarmers will cultivate water intensive crops if water is supplied free, although\nthe water resources in that region may be scarce and such crops will further\ndeplete the already scarce resources. If water is priced to reflect scarcity,\nfarmers will cultivate crops suitable to the region. Fertiliser and pesticide\nsubsidies result in overuse of resources which can be harmful to the\nenvironment. Subsidies provide an incentive for wasteful use of resources.\nThink about subsidies in terms of incentives and ask yourself whether it is\nwise from the economic viewpoint to provide free electricity to farmers.\n2024-25"

It is principally\nfor these reasons that the erstwhile\ngovernments had to play an extensive\nrole in promoting the industrial sector.\nIn addition, the decision to develop the\nIndian economy on socialist lines led\nto the policy of the government\ncontrolling the commanding heights of\nthe economy, as the Second Five  Year\nplan put it. This meant that the\ngovernment would have complete\ncontrol of those industries that were\nvital for the economy. The policies of the\nprivate sector would have to be\ncomplimentary to those of the public\nsector, with the public sector leading\nthe way.\nIndus trial Policy Resolution 1956\n(IPR 1956):  In accordance with the\ngoal of the state controlling the\ncommanding heights of the economy,\nthe Industrial Policy Resolution of\n1956 was adopted. This resolution\nformed the basis of the Second Five\nYear Plan, the plan which tried to\nbuild the basis for a socialist pattern\nof society. This resolution classified\nindustries into three categories. The\nfirst category comprised industries\nwhich would be exclusively owned by\nthe government ; the second category\nconsisted of industries in which the\nprivate sector could supplement the\nefforts of the public sector, with the\ngovernment taking the sole\nresponsibility for starting new units;\nthe third category consisted of the\nremaining industries which were to\nbe in the p rivate sector.Although there was a category of\nindustries left to the private sector,\nthe sector was kept under state\ncontrol through a system of licenses.\nNo new industry was allowed unless\na license was obtained from the\ngovernment. This policy was used for\npromoting industry in backward\nregions ; it was easier to obtain a\nlicense if the industrial unit was\nestablished in an economically\nbackward area. In addition, such\nunits were given certain concessions\nsuch as tax benefits and electricity\nat a lower tariff. The purpose of this\npolicy was to promote regional\nequality .\nEven an existing industry had to\nobtain a license for expanding\noutput or for diversifying production\n(producing a new variety of goods).\nThis was meant  to ensure that the\nquantity of goods produced was not\nmore than what the economy\nrequired. License to expand\nproduction was given only if the\ngovernment was convinced that the\neconomy required a larger quantit y\nof goods.\nSmall -Scale Industry:  In 1955, the\nVillage and Small- Scale Industries\nCommittee, also called the Karve\nCommittee, noted the possibility of\nusing small-scale industries for\npromoting rural development. A\n‘small -scale industry’ is defined with\nreference to the  maximum invest -\nment allowed on the assets of a unit.\nThis limit has changed over a period\nof time.

But these\nindustries cannot compete with the big\nindustrial firms; it is obvious that\ndevelopment of small-scale industry\nrequires them to be shielded from the\nlarge firms. For this purpose, the\nproduction of a number of products\nwas reserved for the small-scale\nindustry; the criterion of reservation\nbeing the ability of these units to\nmanufacture the goods. They were also\ngiven concessions such as lower excise\nduty and bank loans at lower interest\nrates.\n2.5 T RADE POLICY: IMPORT  SUBSTITUTION\nThe industrial policy that India\nadopted was closely related to the\ntrade policy . In the first seven plans,\ntrade was characterised by what is\ncommonly called an inward looking\ntrade strategy . Technically, this\nstrategy is called import substi -\ntution . This policy aimed at replacing\nor substituting imports with domestic\nproduction. For example, instead of\nimporting vehicles made in a foreign\ncountry, industries would be\nencouraged to produce them in India\nitself. In this policy the government\nprotected the domestic industries\nfrom foreign competition. Protection\nfrom imports took two forms: tariffs\nand quotas. Tariffs are a tax onimported goods; they make imported\ngoods more expensive and discourage\ntheir use. Quotas specify the quantity\nof goods which can be imported. The\neffect of tariffs and quotas is that they\nrestrict imports and, therefore, protect\nthe domestic firms from foreign\ncompetition.\nThe policy of protection was based\non the notion that industries of\ndeveloping countries were not in a\nposition to compete against the\ngoods produced by more developed\neconomies. It was assumed that if the\ndomestic industries were protected\nthey would  learn to compete in the\ncourse of time. Our planners also\nfeared the possibility of foreign\nexchange being spent on import of\nluxury goods if no restrictions were\nplaced on imports. Nor was any\nserious thought given to promote\nexports until the mid-1980s.\nEffect of Policies on Industrial\nDevelopment:  The achievements of\nIndia’s industrial sector during the\nfirst seven plans are impressive\nindeed. The proportion of GDP\ncontributed by the industrial\nsector increased in  the period from\n13 per cent  in 1950-51 to 24.6 per cent\nin 1990 -91. The rise in the\nindustry’s share of GDP is an\nimportant indicator of development.\nThe six per cent annual growth rate\nof the industrial sector during the\nperiod is commendable.

For example, even now only the\npublic sector supplies national\ndefense. And even though the private\nsector can manage hotels well, yet,\nthe government also runs hotels. This\nhas led some scholars to argue that\nthe state should get out of areas\nwhich the private sector can manage\nand the government may concentrate\nits resources on important services\nwhich the private sector cannot\nprovide.\nMany public sector firms incurred\nhuge  losses  but continued  to\nfunction because it is difficult  to close\na government undertaking even if it\nis a drain on the nation’s limited\nresources. This does not mean that\nprivate firms are always profitable\n(indeed, quite a few of the public\nsector firms were originally private\nfirms which were on the verge of\nclosure due to losses; they were then\nnationalised to protect the jobs of the\nworkers). However , a loss -making\nprivate firm will not waste resources\nby being kept running despite the\nlosses.\nThe need to obtain a license to start\nan industry was misused by\nindustrial houses; a big industrialist\nwould get a license not for starting a\nnew firm but to prevent competitors\nfrom starting new firms. The excessiveregulation of what came to be called the\npermit license raj  prevented certain\nfirms from becoming more efficient.\nMore time was spent by industrialists\nin trying to obtain a license or lobby\nwith the concerned ministries rather\nthan on thinking about how to improve\ntheir products.\nThe protection from foreign\ncompetition was also being criticised\non the ground that it continued even\nafter it proved to do more harm than\ngood. Due to restrictions on imports,\nthe Indian consumers had to\npurchase whatever the Indian\nproducers produced. The producers\nwere aware that they had a captive\nmarket; so they had no incentive to\nimprove the quality of their goods.\nWhy should they think of improving\nquality when they could sell low\nquality items at a high price?\nCompetition from imports forces our\nproducers to be more efficient.\nA few economists also point out\nthat the public sector is not meant\nfor earning profits but to promote the\nwelfare of the nation. The public\nsector firms, on this view, should be\nevaluated on the basis of the extent\nto which they contribute to the welfare\nof people and not on the profits they\nearn.

Some scholars argue\nthat, over the years, this policy resulted\nin the establishment of a variety of\nrules and laws , which were aimed at\ncontrolling and regulating the\neconomy, ended up  instead  in\nhampering the process of growth and\ndevelopment. Others state that India,\nwhich started its developmental path\nfrom near stagnation, has since been\nable to achieve growth in savings,\ndeveloped a diversified industrial\nsector which produces a variety of\ngoods and has experienced sustained\nexpansion of agricultural output\nwhich has  ensured food security.\nIn 1991, India met with an\neconomic crisis relating to its external\ndebt  — the government was not\nable to make repayments on its\nborrowings from abroad; foreign\nexchange reserves , which we\ngenerally maintain to import petroleum\nand other important items, dropped\nto levels that were not sufficient for\neven a fortnight. The crisis was\nfurther compounded by rising prices\nof essential goods. All these led the\ngovernment to introduce a new set ofpolicy measures which changed the\ndirection of our developmental\nstrategies.  In this chapter , we will\nlook at the background of the crisis,\nmeasures that the government has\nadopted and their impact on various\nsectors of the economy.\n3.2 B ACKGROUND\nThe origin of the financial crisis can\nbe traced from the inefficient\nmanagement of the Indian economy\nin the 1980s. W e know that for\nimplementing various policies and\nits general administration, the\ngovernment generates funds from\nvarious sources such as taxation,\nrunning of public sector enterprises\netc. When  expenditure is more than\nincome, the government borrows to\nfinance the deficit  from banks and\nalso from people within the country\nand from international financial\ninstitutions . When we import goods\nlike petroleum, we pay in dollars\nwhich we earn from our exports.\nDevelopment policies required that\neven though the revenues were\nvery low, the government had\nto overshoot its revenue to meet\nchallenge s like unemployment,\npoverty and population explosion. The\ncontinued spending on development\nprogrammes of the government did not\ngenerate additional revenue.

When the\ngovernment was spending a large\nshare of its income on areas which do\nnot provide immediate returns such as\nthe social sector and defence, there was\na need to utilise the rest of its revenue\nin a highly ef ficient manner . The\nincome from public sector\nundertakings was also not very high to\nmeet the growing expenditure. At\ntimes, our foreign exchange ,\nborrowed from other countries and\ninternational financial institutions,\nwas spent on meeting consumption\nneeds. Neither was an attempt made to\nreduce such profligate spending nor\nsufficient attention was given to boost\nexports to pay for the growing imports.\nIn the late 1980s, government\nexpenditure began to exceed its\nrevenue by such large margins that\nmeeting the expenditure through\nborrowings  became unsustainable.\nPrices of many essential goods rose\nsharply. Imports grew at a very high\nrate without matching growth of\nexports. As pointed out earlier , foreign\nexchange reserves declined to a level\nthat was not adequate to finance\nimport s for more than two weeks.\nThere was also not sufficient foreign\nexchange to pay the interest that\nneed ed to be paid to international\nlenders.  Also no country or international\nfunder was willing to lend to India.\nIndia approached the International\nBank for  Reconstruction and\nDevelopment  (IBRD) , popularly\nknown as World Bank  and the\nInternational Monetary Fund  (IMF) ,and received $7 billion as loan to\nmanage the crisis.

The\nthrust of the policies was towards\ncreating a more competitive\nenvironment in the economy and\nremoving the barriers to entry and\ngrowth of firms. This set of policies\ncan broadly be classified into two\ngroups: the stabilisation measures\nand the structural reform measures.\nStabilisation measures are short-\nterm measures, intended to correct\nsome of the weaknesses that have\ndeveloped in the balance of\npayments  and to bring inflation\nunder control.

Liberalisation was\nintroduced to put an end to these\nrestrictions and open various sectors\nof the economy. Though a few\nliberalisation measures were\nintroduced in 1980s in areas of\nindustrial licensing, export-import\npolicy , technology upgradation,\nfiscal policy  and foreign investment,\nreform policies initiated in 1991 were\nmore comprehensive. Let us study\nsome important areas , such as the\nindustrial sector , financial sector , tax\nreforms, foreign exchange markets\nand trade and investment sectors\nwhich received greater attention in\nand after 1991.\nDeregulation of Industrial Sector: In\nIndia, regulatory mechanisms were\nenforced in various ways (i) industrial\nlicensing  under which every  entrepreneur\nhad to get permission from government\nofficials to start a firm, close a firm\nor decide the amount of goods\nthat could be produced (ii) private\nsector was not allowed in many\nindustries (iii) some goods could be\nproduced only in small-scale industries,\nand (iv) controls on price fixation and\ndistribution of selected industrial\nproducts.The reform policies introduced in\nand after 1991 removed many of\nthese restrictions.  Industrial\nlicensing was abolished for almost all\nbut product categories  — alcohol,\ncigarettes, hazardous chemicals ,\nindustrial explosives, electronics,\naerospace and drugs  and pharma\n-\nceuticals.  The only industries  which\nare now reserved for the public sector\nare a part of atomic energy\ngeneration and some core activities\nin railway transport. Many goods\nproduced by small -scale industries\nhave now been dereserved . In m ost\nindustries, the market has been\nallowed to  determine the prices.\nFinancial Sector Reforms:\nFinancial sector includes financial\ninstitutions , such as commercial\nbanks, investment banks, stock\nexchange  operations and foreign\nexchange market. The financial\nsector in India is regulated  by the\nReserve Bank of India (RBI).

Foreign\ninvestment limit in banks was raised to\naround 74 per cent. Those banks which\nfulfil certain conditions have been given\nfreedom to set up new branches\nwithout the approval of the RBI and\nrationalise their existing branch\nnetworks. Though banks have been\ngiven permission to generate resources\nfrom India and abroad, certain\nmanagerial aspects  have been retained\nwith the RBI to safeguard the interests\nof the account-holders and the nation.\nForeign Institutional Investors  (FII),\nsuch as merchant bankers, mutual\nfunds and pension funds, are now\nallowed to invest in Indian financial\nmarkets.\nTax Reforms: Tax reforms  are\nconcerned with the reforms in the\ngovernment’s taxation and public\nexpenditure policies, which are\ncollectively known as its fiscal policy .\nThere are two types of taxes: direct and\nindirect. Direct taxes  consist of taxes\non incomes of individuals, as well as,\nprofits of business enterprises . Since\n1991, there has been a continuous\nreduction in the taxes on individual\nincomes as it was felt that high rates of\nincome tax were an important reason\nfor tax evasion. It is now widely\naccepted that moderate rates of income\ntax encourage savings and voluntary\ndisclosure of income. The rate of\ncorporation tax , which was very high\nearlier, has been gradually reduced.\nEfforts have also been made to reform\nthe indirect taxes , taxes levied on\ncommodities, in order to facilitate theestablishment of a common national\nmarket for goods and commodities.\nIn the year 2016, Indian constitution\nwas amended to empower state\ngovernments and union Government to\ncome out with laws to impose Goods\nand Services Tax. This has led to\nintroduction of GST in India. This is\nexpected to generate additional revenue\nfor the government, reduce tax evasion\nand create ‘one nation, one tax and one\nmarket’. Another component of reform\nin this area is simplification. In order\nto encourage better compliance on the\npart of taxpayers, many procedures\nhave been simplified and the rates also\nsubstantially lowered.\nForeign Exchange Reforms: The  first\nimportant reform in the external sector\nwas made in the foreign exchange\nmarket. In 1991, as an immediate\nmeasure to resolve the balance of\npayments crisis, the rupee was\ndevalued  against foreign currencies.\nThis led to an increase in the inflow of\nforeign exchange. It also set the tone to\nfree the determination of rupee value\nin the foreign exchange market from\ngovernment control. Now, more often\nthan not,  markets  determine exchange\nrates based on the  demand and supply\nof foreign exchange.\nTrade and Investment Policy\nReforms: Liberalisation of trade and\ninvestment regime was initiated to\nincrease international competitiveness of\nindustrial production and also foreign\ninvestments and technology into the\neconomy. The aim was also to promote\nthe efficiency of local industries and\nadoption of modern technologies.\n2024-25"

In order to improve\nefficiency, infuse professionalism and enable them to compete more effectively\nin the liberalised global environment, the government identifies PSEs and\ndeclare them as maharatnas, navratnas and miniratnas.

Greater operational,\nfinancial and managerial autonomy has also been granted to profit-making\nenterprises referred to as miniratnas.\nThe Central Public Sector Enterprises are designated with different status.\nA few examples of public enterprises with their status are as follows:\n(i) Maharatnas  – (a) Indian Oil Corporation Limited, and (b) Steel Authority of\nIndia Limited, (ii) Navratnas  – (a) Hindustan Aeronautics Limited,\n(b) Mahanagar Telephone Nigam Limited; and (iii) Miniratnas  – (a) Bharat\nSanchar Nigam Limited; (b) Airport Authority of India and (c) Indian Railway\nCatering and Tourism Corporation Limited.\nMany of these profitable PSEs were originally formed during the 1950s\nand 1960s when self-reliance was an important element of public policy. They\nwere set up with the intention of providing infrastructure and direct employment\nto the public so that quality end-product reaches the masses at a nominal\ncost and the companies themselves were made accountable to all stakeholders.\nThe granting of status resulted in better performance of these companies.\nScholars allege that instead of facilitating public enterprises in their expansion\nand enabling them to become global players, the government partly privatised\nthem through disinvesment.

Mahadeva and his friends brought this matter\nrepeatedly to the notice of the gover nment of ficials entrusted with this\nresponsibility, but failed. Subsidy was r educed on material (seeds,\nfertilisers) which incr eased Mahadeva’s cost of cultivation.

Further ,\nthe partial removal of fertiliser subsidy\nhas led to increase in the cost of\nproduction, which has severely\naffected the small and mar ginal\nfarmers. This sector has been\nexperiencing a number of policy\nchanges such as reduction in import\nduties on agricultural products, low\nminimum support price and lifting of\nquantitative restrictions on the imports\nof agricultural products. These have\nadversely af fected Indian far mers as\nthey now have to face increased\ninternational competition.\nMoreover , because of  export-\noriented policy strategies in agriculture,\nthere has been a shift from production\nfor the domestic market towards\nproduction for the export market\nfocusing on cash crops in lieu of\nproduction of food grains. This puts\npressure on prices of food grains.\nReforms in Industry: Industrial\ngrowth has also recorded a slowdown.\nThis is because of decreasing demand\nof industrial products due to\nvarious reasons such as cheaper\nimports, inadequate investment ininfrastructure etc. In a globalised\nworld, developing countries are\ncompelled to open up their economies\nto greater flow of goods and capital\nfrom developed countries and\nrendering their industries vulnerable\nto imported goods.  Cheaper imports\nhave, thus, replaced the demand\nfor domestic goods. Domestic\nmanufacturers are facing competition\nfrom imports. The infrastructure\nfacilities, including power supply,\nhave remained inadequate due to lack\nof investment. Globalisation is, thus,\noften seen as creating conditions for\nthe free movement of goods and\nservices from foreign countries that\nadversely affect the local industries\nand employment opportunities in\ndeveloping countries.\nMoreover , a developing country\nlike India still does not have the access\nto developed countries’ markets\nbecause of high non-tariff barriers.

Also,\nBox 3.3: Siricilla Tragedy!\nPower sector reforms in many Indian states led to do away with the supply of\nelectricity at subsidised rates and steep rise in power tariff. This has affected\nworkers engaged in small industries. Powerloom textile industry in Andhra\nPradesh is an example. Since the wages of the powerloom workers are linked\nto the production of cloth, power cut means cut in wages of weavers, who\nwere already suffering from hike in tariff. A few years ago, this led to a crisis\nin the livelihood of the weavers and 50 powerloom workers committed suicide\nin a small town called ‘Siricilla’ in Andhra Pradesh.\nØDo you think the power tariff should not be raised?\nØWhat would be your suggestions to revive small industries affected  by\nreforms?the r eform  policies, involving tarif f\nreduction, have curtailed the scope for\nraising revenue through custom duties.\nIn order to attract foreign investment,\ntax incentives are provided to foreign\ninvestors which further reduced the\nscope for raising tax revenues.

Economists have stressed\nthe need for expanding educational\nopportunities in a nation as it\naccelerates the development process.\n4.2 W HAT IS HUMAN CAPITAL ?\nJust as a country can turn physical\nresources like land into physical\ncapital like factories, similarly, it can\nalso turn human resources like\nnurses, farmers, teachers, students\ninto human capital like engineers and\ndoctors. Societies need sufficient\nhuman capital in the first plac e—in\nthe form of competent people who have\nthemselves been educated and trained\nas professors and other professionals.\nIn other words, we need good human\ncapital to produce other human capital\n(say, nurses, farmers, teachers,\ndoctors, engineers.. .). This means that\nwe need investment in human capital\nto produce more human capital out of\nhuman resources.\nLet us understand a little more of\nwhat human capital means by posing\nthe following question s:\n(i)What are the sources of human\ncapital?\n(ii)Is there any relation between\nhuman capital and economic\ngrowth of a country?\n(iii)Is the formation of human\ncapital linked to people’s all-r ound\ndevelopment or , as it is now called,\nhuman development?\n(iv)What role can the  government\nplay in human capital formation\nin India?4.3 S OURCES  OF HUMAN CAPITAL\nInvestment in education is considered\nas one of the main sources of human\ncapital. There are several other sources\nas well. Investments in health, on - the-\njob training, migration and information\nare the other sources of human capital\nformation.\nWhy do your parents spend\nmoney on education? Spending on\neducation by individu als is similar to\nspending on capital goods by\ncompanies with the objective of\nincreasing future profits over a period\nof time. Likewise, individuals invest\nin education with the objective of\nincreasing their future income.\nLike education, health is also\nconsidered as an important input for\nthe development of a nation as much\nas it is important for the development\nof an individual.\nWho can work bette r—a sick\nperson or a person with sound health?\nA sick labourer without access to\nmedical facilities is compelled to\nabstain from work and there is loss of\nproductivity. Hence, expenditure on\nhealth is an important source of\nhuman cap ital formation.Work This Out\nØIdentify and collect the data\nfrom three families from\ndifferent strata (i) very poor\n(ii) middle class and (iii)\naffluent.

Health expenditur e\ndirectly increases the supply of healthy\nlabour force and is, thus, a source of\nhuman  capital\nformation.\nFirms spend on\ngiving on-the-\njob-training  to\ntheir workers.\nThis may take\ndifferent for ms:\none, the workers may be trained in the\nfirm itself under the supervision of a\nskilled worker; two, the workers may\nbe sent for of f-campus training. In both\nthese cases firms incur some expenses.\nFirms will, thus, insist that the workers\nshould work for a specific period of\ntime, after their on-the-job training,\nduring which it can recover the benefits\nof the enhanced productivity owing to\nthe training. Expenditure regarding on-\nthe-job training is a source of human\ncapital formation as the return of such\nexpenditure in the form of enhanced\nlabour productivity is more than the\ncost of it.\nPeople migrate  in search of jobs\nthat fetch them higher salaries than\nwhat they may get in their nativeplaces. Unemployment is the reason for\nthe rural-urban migration in India.\nTechnically qualified persons, like\nengineers and doctors, migrate to other\ncountries because of higher salaries\nthat they may get in such countries.\nMigration in both these cases involves\ncost of transport, higher cost of living\nin the migrated places and psychic\ncosts of living in a strange socio-\ncultural setup. The enhanced earnings\nin the new place outweigh the costs of\nmigration; hence, expenditure on\nmigration is also a source of human\ncapital formation.\nPeople spend to acquire\ninformation  relating to the labour\nmarket and other markets like\neducation and health. For example,\npeople want to know the level of salaries\nassociated with various types of jobs,\nwhether the educational institutions\nprovide the right type of employable\nskills and at what cost. This information\nis necessary to make decisions\nregarding investments in human capital\nas well as for ef ficient utilisation of the\nacquired human capital stock.\nExpenditure incurred for acquiring\ninformation relating to the labour\nmarket and other markets is also a\nsource of human capital formation.\n2024-25"

                "text": "62 INDIAN ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTBox 4.1: Physical and Human Capital\nBoth the forms of capital formation are outcomes of conscious investment decisions.\nDecision regarding investment in physical capital is taken on the basis of one’s knowledge\nin this regard. The entrepreneur possesses knowledge to calculate the expected rates of\nreturn to a range of investments and then rationally decides which one of the\ninvestments should be made. The ownership of physical capital is the outcome of the\nconscious decision of the owner —  the physical capital formation is mainly an economic\nand technical process. A substantial part of the human capital formation takes place\nin one’s life when she/he is unable to decide whether it would maximise her/his earnings.\nChildren are given different types of school education and health care facilities by their\nparents and the society. The peers, educators and society influence the decisions\nregarding human capital investments even at the tertiary level, that is, at the college\nlevel. Mor eover, the human capital for mation at this stage is dependent upon the alr eady\nformed human capital at the school level. Human capital formation is partly a social\nprocess and partly a conscious decision of the possessor of the human capital.\nYou know that the owner of a physical capital, say a bus, need not be pr esent in\nthe place wher e it is used; wher eas, a bus-driver , who possesses the knowledge and\nability to drive the bus, should be present when the bus is used for transportation of\npeople and materials. Physical capital is tangible and can be easily sold in the market\nlike any other commodity. Human capital is intangible; it is endogenously built in the\nbody and mind of its owner . Human capital is not sold in the market; only the services\nof the human capital are sold and, hence, there arises the necessity of the owner of the\nhuman capital to be present in the place of production. The physical capital is\nseparable fr om its owner , wher eas, human capital is inseparable fr om its owner .\nThe two forms of capital differ in terms of mobility across space. Physical capital is\ncompletely mobile between countries except for some artificial trade restrictions. Human\ncapital is not perfectly mobile between countries as movement is restricted by nationality\nand culture. Therefore, physical capital formation can be built even through imports,\nwhereas human capital formation is to be done through conscious policy formulations\nin consonance with the nature of the society and economy and expenditure by the\nstate and the individuals.\nBoth forms of capital depreciate with time but the nature of depreciation differs\nbetween the two. Continuous use of machine leads to depreciation and change of\ntechnology makes a machine obsolete. In the case of human capital, depreciation takes\nplace with ageing but can be reduced, to a large extent, through continuous investment\nin education, health, etc. This investment also facilitates the human capital to cope\nwith change in technology which is not the case with physical capital.\nNature of benefits flowing from human capital are  different from that of physical\ncapital. Human capital benefits not only the owner but also the society in general. This\nis called external benefit. An educated person can effectively take part in a democratic\nprocess and contribute to the socio-economic progress of a nation. A healthy person,\nby maintaining personal hygiene and sanitation, stops the spread of contagious diseases\nand epidemics. Human capital creates both private and social benefits, whereas physical\ncapital creates only private benefit. That is, benefits from a capital good flow to those\nwho pay the price for the product and services produced by it.\n2024-25"

Education\nprovides knowledge to understand\nchanges in society and scientific\nadvancements, thus, facilitate\ninventions and innovations. Similarly,\nthe availability of educated labour\nforce facilitates adaptation to new\ntechnologies.\nEmpirical evidence to prove that\nincrease in human capital causes\neconomic growth is rather nebulous.\nThis may be because of measurement\nproblems. For example, education\nmeasured in terms of years of\nschooling, teacher -pupil ratio and\nenrolment rates may not reflect the\nquality of education; health services\nmeasured in monetary terms, life\nexpectancy and mortality rates may\nnot reflect the true health status of the\npeople in a country. Using the\nindicators mentioned above, an\nanalysis of improvement in education\nand health sectors and growth in real\nper capita income in both developing\nand developed countries shows that\nthere is convergence in the measures\nof human capital but no sign of\nconvergence of per capita real income.\nIn other words, the human capital\ngrowth in developing countries has\nbeen faster but the growth of per capita\nreal income has not been that fast.\nThere are reasons to believe that thecausality between human capital and\neconomic growth flows in either\ndirections. That is, higher income\ncauses building of high level of human\ncapital and vice versa, that is, high level\nof human capital causes growth of\nincome.\nIndia recognised the importance of\nhuman capital in economic growth\nlong ago.

Human capital\ntreats human beings as a means to\nan end; the end being the increase\nin pr oductivity. In this view, any\ninvestment in education and health is\nunproductive if it does not enhance\noutput of goods and services. In the\nhuman development perspective,human beings are ends in themselves.\nHuman welfare should be increased\nthrough investments in education and\nhealth even if such investments do not\nresult in higher labour pr oductivity.\nTherefore, basic education and basic\nhealth are important in themselves,\nirrespective of their contribution to\nlabour pr oductivity. In such a view,\nevery individual has a right to get basic\neducation and basic health care, that\nis, every individual has a right to be\nliterate and lead a healthy life.Box 4.2: India as a Knowledge Economy\nThe Indian software industry has been showing an impressive record over the\npast two decades.

W e\nhave already learnt that human\ncapital formation is the outcome\nof investments in education, health,\non-the-job training, migration and\ninformation. Of these education and\nhealth are very important sources of\nhuman capital for mation. W e know\nthat India is a federal country with a\nunion government, state governments\nand local governments (Municipal\nCorporations, Municipalities and\nVillage Panchayats). The Constitution\nof India mentions the functions to\nbe carried out by each level of\ngover nment. Accor dingly, expendi-\ntures on both education and health are\nto be carried out simultaneously by all\nthe three tiers of the government.\nAnalysis of health sector is taken up\nin Chapter 8; hence, we will analyse\nonly the education sector here.\nDo you know who takes care of\neducation and health in India? Before\nwe take up the analysis of the education\nsector in India, we will look into the\nneed for government intervention in\neducation and health sectors. W e do\nunderstand that education and health\ncare services create both private and\nsocial benefits and this is the reason\nfor the existence of both private and\npublic institutions in the education and\nhealth service markets. Expenditures\non education and health make\nsubstantial long-term impact and they\ncannot be easily reversed; hence,\ngovernment intervention is essential. Forinstance, once a child is admitted to a\nschool or health care centre where the\nrequired services are not provided,\nbefore the decision is taken to shift the\nchild to another institution, substantial\namount of damage would have been\ndone. Mor eover , individual consumers\nof these services do not have complete\ninformation about the quality of\nservices and their costs. In this\nsituation, the providers of education\nand health services acquire monopoly\npower and are involved in exploitation.\nThe role of government in this situation\nis to ensure that the private providers of\nthese services adhere to the standards\nstipulated by the government and\ncharge the correct price.\nIn India, the ministries of\neducation at the union and state level,\ndepartments of education and various\norganisations like National Council of\nEducational Resear ch and T raining\n(NCER T), University Grants Commission\n(UGC)  and All India  Council of\nTechnical Education (AICTE) facilitate\ninstitutions which come under the\neducation sector .

Why is this so?\nWhy should we attach such significance\nto rural development when we see\naround us fast growing cities with large\nindustries and modern information\ntechnology hubs?

W ork at home includes\nnot only traditional work like\nweaving, lace making or variety of\nhandicrafts but also modern jobs\nlike programming work in the IT\nindustry. Earlier factory work\nmeant working in factories located\nin cities whereas now technology\nhas enabled people to produce\nthose factory-based goods at\nhome in villages.

W ork plays\nan important role in our lives as\nindividuals and as members of society.\nPeople work for ‘earning’ a living. Some\npeople get, or have, money by inheriting\nit, not working for it. This does not\ncompletely satisfy anybody.

W e do not work onlyfor ourselves; we also have a sense of\naccomplishment when we work to meet\nthe requirements of those who are\ndependent on us. Having recognised\nthe  importance of work, Mahatma\nGandhi insisted upon education and\ntraining through a variety of works\nincluding craft.\nStudying about working people\ngives us insights into the quality and\nnature of employment in a country and\nhelps in understanding and planning\nour human resources.

Who is a worker?\nWhen a farmer works on fields, he or\nshe produces food grains and raw\nmaterials for industries. Cotton\nbecomes cloth in textile mills and in\npowerlooms. Lorries transport goods\nfrom one place to another . We know\nthat the total money value of all such\nfinal goods and services produced in a\ncountry in a year is called its gross\ndomestic pr oduct for that year . When\nwe also consider what we pay for our\nimports and get from our exports we\nfind that there is a net earning for the\ncountry which may be positive (if we\nhave exported more in value terms than\nimported) or negative (if imports\nexceeded exports in value terms) or zero\n(if exports and imports were of the same\nvalue). When we add this earning (plus\nor minus) from foreign transactions,\nwhat we get is called the country’s gross\nnational pr oduct for that year .\nThose activities which contribute to\nthe gross national product are called\neconomic activities. All those who are\nengaged in economic activities, in\nwhatever capacity — high or low, are\nworkers. Even if some of them\ntemporarily abstain from work due to\nillness, injury or other physical\ndisability, bad weather , festivals, social\nor religious functions, they are also\nworkers.  W orkers also include all those\nwho help the main workers in these\nactivities. W e generally think of only\nthose who are paid by an employer for\ntheir work as workers. This is not so.\nThose who are self-employed are also\nworkers.The nature of employment in India\nis multifaceted. Some get employment\nthroughout the year; some others get\nemployed for only a few months in a\nyear. Many workers do not get fair\nwages for their work. While estimating\nthe number of workers, all those who\nare engaged in economic activities are\nincluded as employed. Y ou might be\ninterested in knowing the number of\npeople actively engaged in various\neconomic activities. During 2017-18,\nIndia had about a 471 million strong\nworkforce. Since majority of our people\nreside in rural areas, the proportion of\nworkfor ce residing ther e is higher .

If\nthe ratio is  higher , it means that the\nengagement of people is greater; if the\nratio for a country is medium, or low,\nit means that a very high proportion\nof its population is not involved\ndirectly in economic activities.\nYou might have alr eady studied,\nin lower classes, the meaning of the\nterm ‘population’. Population is\ndefined as the total number of people\nwho reside in a particular locality ata particular point of time. If you want\nto know the worker -population ratio\nfor India, divide the total number of\nworkers in India by the population in\nIndia and multiply it by 100, you will\nget the worker -population ratio for\nIndia.\nIf you look at Table 6.1, it shows\nthe different levels of participation of\npeople in economic activities. For\nevery 100 persons, about 35 (by\nrounding off 3 4.7) are workers in\nIndia. In urban areas, the proportion\nis about 34, whereas in rural India, the\nratio is about 35. Why is there such a\ndifference? People in rural areas have\nlimited resources to earn a higher\nincome and participate more in the\nemployment market. Many do not go\nto schools, colleges and other training\ninstitutions. Even if some go, they\ndiscontinue in the middle to join the\nworkforce; whereas, in urban areas, a\nconsiderable section is able to study in\nvarious educational institutions. Urban\npeople have a variety of employment\nopportunities. They look for the\nappropriate job to suit their\nqualifications and skills. In rural areas,\npeople cannot stay at home as their\neconomic condition may not allow them\nto do so.\nTABLE 6.1\nWorker-Population Ratio in India,\n2017-2018\nSex Worker -Population Ratio\nTotal Rural Urban\nMen 52.1 51.7\n53.0\nWomen 16.5 17.5 14.2\nTotal 34.7\n35.0 33.9\n2024-25"

However ,\nthere was always fluctuation in the\ngrowth of GDP . During this period,\nemployment grew at the rate of not\nmore than 2 per cent.\nChart 6.3 also points at another\ndisheartening development in the late\n1990s: employment growth started\ndeclining and reached the level of\ngrowth that India had in the early\nstages of planning.

The government, through itslabour laws , enable them to protect their\nrights in various ways. This section of the\nworkforce forms trade unions , bargains\nwith employers for better wages and other\nsocial security  measures.

It also includes all non-\nfarm casual wage labourers who work\nfor more than one employer such as\nconstruction workers and headload\nworkers.

Discuss the\npossible ways in the class.\nBox 6.1: Formal Sector Employment\nThe information relating to employment in the formal sector is collected by the Union\nMinistry of Labour through employment exchanges located in different parts of the country.\nDo you know who is the major employer in the formal sector in India?

Her e also men for m the majority, as women constitute only about\none-sixth of the formal sector workforce.

The National\nStatistical Office (Previously it was known\nas National Sample Survey Organisation)\ndefines unemployment as a situation in\nwhich all those who, owing to lack of\nwork, are not working but either seek\nwork through employment exchanges,\nintermediaries, friends or relatives or by\nmaking applications to prospective\nemployers or express their willingness\nor availability for work under the\nprevailing condition of work and\nremunerations. There are a variety of\nways by which an unemployed person\nis identified. Economists define\nunemployed person as one who is not\nable to get employment of even one hour\nin half a day.\nThere are three sources of data on\nunemployment : Reports of Census of\nIndia, National Statistical Of fice’s\nReports of Employment and\nUnemployment Situation, Annual\nReports of Periodic Labour Force\nSurvey, and Directorate General ofEmployment and T raining\ndata of Registration with\nEmployment Exchanges.\nThough they provide\ndifferent estimates of\nunemployment, they do\nprovide us with the\nattributes of the\nunemployed and the\nvariety of unemployment\nprevailing in our country.\nDo we have different types\nof unemployment in our\neconomy? The situation\ndescribed in the first\nparagraph of this section is called open\nunemployment. Economists call\nunemployment prevailing in Indian farms\nas disguised unemployment. What is\ndisguised unemployment? Suppose a\nfarmer has four acres of land and he\nactually needs only two workers and\nhimself to carry out various operations\non his far m in a year , but if he employs\nfive workers and his family members\nsuch as his wife and children, this\nsituation is known as disguised\nunemployment. One study conducted in\nthe late 1950s showed about one-third\nof agriculture workers in India as\ndisguisedly unemployed.\nYou may have noticed that many\npeople migrate to an urban area, pick\nup a job and stay there for some time,\nbut come back to their home villages\nas soon as the rainy season begins.\nWhy do they do so? This is because\nwork in agriculture is seasonal; there\nare no employment opportunities in the\nvillage for all months in the year . When\nthere is no work to do on farms, people\ngo to urban areas and look for jobs.Fig. 6.6 Sugar cane cutters: disguised unemployment is common\nin farm works\n2024-25"

This is also\na common form of unemployment\nprevailing in India.\nThough we have witnessed slow\ngrowth of employment, have you seen\npeople being unemployed over a very\nlong time? Scholars say that in India,\npeople  cannot remain  completely\nunemployed for very long because their\ndesperate economic condition would\nnot allow them to be so. Y ou will rather\nfind them being forced to accept\njobs that nobody else would do,\nunpleasant or even dangerous jobs in\nunclean, or unhealthy surroundings.\nThe Central and State governments\ntake  initiatives and generate\nemployment to facilitate a decent living\nfor low income families through various\nmeasures. These will be discussed in\nthe following section.6.9 G OVERNMENT  AND\nEMPLOYMENT  GENERATION\nYou may r ecall about\nthe Mahatma Gandhi National\nRural Employment Guarantee\nAct 2005. It promises 100 days\nof guaranteed wage employment\nto all rural households who\nvolunteer to  do unskilled\nmanual work. The scheme\nbased on this Act is one of the\nmany measures the\ngovernment has implemented\nto generate employment for\nthose who are in need of jobs\nin rural areas.\nSince Independence, the\nUnion and State governments\nhave played an important role in\ngenerating employment or creating\nopportunities for employment\ngeneration. Their efforts can be\nbroadly categorised into two — direct\nand indirect. In the first category, as\nyou have seen in the preceding section,\nthe government employs people in\nvarious departments for administrative\npurposes. It also runs industries,\nhotels and transport companies, and\nhence, provides employment directly\nto workers. When the output\nof goods and services from\ngovernment enterprises increases, then\nprivate enterprises which receive raw\nmaterials from government enterprises\nwill also raise their output and hence\nincrease the number of employment\nopportunities in the economy.

This is the indirect\ngeneration of employment\nopportunities by the government\ninitiatives in the economy.\nMany programmes that the\ngovernments implement, aimed at\nalleviating poverty, are through\nemployment generation. They are\nalso known as employment\ngeneration programmes.

Newly\nemerging jobs are found mostly in the\nservice sector . The expansion of the\nservice sector and the advent of hightechnology now frequently permit a\nhighly competitive existence for efficient\nsmall scale and often individual\nenterprises or specialist workers side by\nside with the multinationals.\nOutsourcing of work is becoming a\ncommon practice. It means that a\nbig firm finds it profitable to close\ndown some of its specialist\ndepartments (for example, legal or\ncomputer programming or customer\nservice sections) and hand over a large\nnumber of small piecemeal jobs to very\nsmall enterprises or specialist\nindividuals, sometimes situated even in\nother countries. The traditional notion\nof the modern factory or office, as a\nresult, has been altered in such\na manner that for many the home\nis becoming the workplace. All of\nthis change has not gone in favour\nof the individual worker . The natur e\nof employment has become more\ninformal with only limited availability\nof social security measures to the\nworkers.\nIn the last few decades, there\nhas been rapid growth in the gross\ndomestic product, but without\nsimultaneous increase in  employment\nopportunities. This has forced the\ngovernment to take up initiatives in\ngenerating employment opportunities\nparticularly in the rural areas.\n2024-25"

The\neconomic development that we have\nachieved so far has come at a very heavy\nprice—at the cost of environmental\nquality. As we step into an era of\nglobalisation that promises higher\neconomic growth, we have to bear in\nmind the adverse consequences of the\npast developmental path on our\nenvironment and consciously choose a\npath of sustainable development. To\nunderstand the unsustainable path of\ndevelopment that we have taken and\nthe challenges of sustainable\ndevelopment, we have to first\nunderstand the significance and\ncontribution of environment to\neconomic development. With this in\nmind, this chapter is divided into three\nsections. The first part deals with the\nfunctions and role of environment. The\nsecond section discusses the state of\nIndia’s environment and the third\nsection deals with steps and strategies\nto achieve sustainable development.\n7.2  E NVIRONMENT  — DEFINITION  AND\nFUNCTIONS\nEnvironment is defined as the total\nplanetary inheritance and the totality\nof all resources. It includes all the bioticand abiotic factors that influence each\nother . While all living elements —the\nbirds, animals and plants, forests,\nfisheries etc .—are biotic elements,\nabiotic elements include air , water , land\netc. Rocks and sunlight are examples\nof abiotic elements of the environment .\nA study of the  environment then calls\nfor a study of the inter-relationship\nbetween these biotic and abiotic\ncomponents of the environment.\nFunctions of the Environment: The\nenvironment performs four vital\nfunctions (i) it supplies resources:\nresources here include both renewable\nand non-renewable resources.\nRenewable resources are those which\ncan be used without the possibility of\nthe resource becoming depleted or\nexhausted. That is, a continuous\nsupply of the resource remains\navailable. Examples of renewable\nresources are the trees in the forests and\nthe fishes in the ocean. Non-renewable\nresources, on the other hand, are those\nwhich get exhausted with extraction\nand use,  for example, fossil fuel (ii) it\nassimilates waste (iii) it sustains life by\nproviding genetic and bio diversity and\n(iv) it also provides aesthetic services\nlike scenery etc.\nThe environment is able to perform\nthese functions without any  interruption\nas long as the demand on theseThe environment, left to itself, can continue to support life for millions of\nyears.

To make matters worse, global\nenvironmental issues such as global\nwarming and ozone depletion also\ncontribute to increased financial\ncommitments for the government.Box 7.1: Global Warming\nGlobal warming is a gradual increase in the average temperature of the earth’s\nlower atmosphere as a result of the increase in greenhouse gases since the\nIndustrial Revolution . Much of the recent observed and projected global\nwarming is human-induced. It is caused by man-made increases in  carbon\ndioxide and other greenhouse gases  through the burning of fossil fuels  and\ndeforestation . Adding carbon dioxide, methane and such other gases (that\nhave the potential to absorb heat) to the atmosphere with no other changes\nwill make our planet’s sur face war mer. The atmospheric concentrations of\ncarbon dioxide and CH4 have increased by 31 per cent and 149 per cent\nrespectively above pre-industrial levels since 1750. During the past century,\nthe atmospheric temperature has risen by 1.1°F (0.6°C) and sea level has\nrisen several inches. Some of the longer -term results of global war ming ar e\nmelting of polar ice with a resulting rise in sea level and coastal flooding;\ndisruption of drinking water supplies dependent on snow melts; extinction of\nspecies as ecological niches disappear; more frequent tropical storms; and an\nincreased incidence of tropical diseases.\nAmong factors that may be contributing to global warming are the burning\nof coal and petroleum products (sources of carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous\noxide, ozone); deforestation, which increases the amount of carbon dioxide in\nthe atmosphere; methane gas released in animal waste; and increased cattle\nproduction, which contributes to deforestation, methane production, and use\nof fossil fuels. A UN Conference on Climate Change, held in Kyoto, Japan, in\n1997, resulted in an international agreement to fight global warming which\ncalled for reduc tions in emissions of greenhouse gases by industrialised nations.\n Source:  www.wikipedia.org\nThus, it is clear that the opportunity\ncosts  of negative environmental\nimpacts are high.\nThe biggest question that arises is:\nare environmental problems new to this\ncentury? If so, why? The answer to this\nquestion requires some elaboration. In\nthe early days when civilisation just\nbegan, or before this phenomenal\nincrease in population, and before\ncountries took to industrialisation, the\ndemand for environmental resources\nand services was much less than their\nsupply.

The problem of ozone depletion is caused by high levels\nof chlorine and bromine compounds in the stratosphere. The origins of these\ncompounds ar e chlor ofluor ocarbons (CFC), used as cooling substances in air -\nconditioners and refrigerators, or as aerosol propellants, and\nbromofluorocarbons (halons), used in fire extinguishers. As a result of depletion\nof the ozone layer , mor e ultraviolet (UV) radiation comes to Earth and causes\ndamage to living organisms. UV radiation seems responsible for skin cancer\nin humans; it also lowers production of phytoplankton and thus affects other\naquatic organisms. It can also influence the growth of terrestrial plants. A\nreduction of approximately 5 per cent in the ozone layer was detected from\n1979 to 1990. Since the ozone layer  prevents most harmful wavelengths of\nultraviolet  light from passing through the Earth’s atmosphere , observed and\nprojected decreases in ozone have generated worldwide concern. This led to\nthe adoption of the Montreal Protocol banning the use of chlorofluorocarbon\n(CFC)  compounds, as well as other ozone depleting chemicals such as carbon\ntetrachloride, trichloroethane (also known as methyl chloroform), and bromine\ncompounds known as halons.\nSource:  www.ceu.hu\nenvironment and the rate of resource\nextraction was less than the rate of\nregeneration of these resources.

On 8 September 1983, when the felling of trees\nwas started in Salkani forest in Sirsi\ndistrict, 160 men, women and children\nhugged the trees and forced the\nwoodcutters to leave. They kept vigil in\nthe forest over the next six weeks. Only\nafter the forest officials assured the\nvolunteers that the trees will be cut\nscientifically and in accordance with the\nworking plan of the district, did they\nleave the trees.\nWhen commercial felling by\ncontractors damaged a large number of\nnatural forests, the idea of hugging the\ntrees gave the people hope and\nconfidence that they can protect the\nforests. On that particular incident, with\nthe felling discontinued, the people saved\n12,000 trees.

For instance, local people should be consulted when\ntrees are marked for felling and trees within 100 metres of a water source\nand on a slope of 30 degrees or above should not be felled.\nDo you know that the government allocates forestlands to industries to\nuse forest materials as industrial raw material?

For example, we dry our clothes,\ngrains, other agricultural products as\nwell as various items made for daily use.\nWe also use sunlight to war m ourselves\nin winter . Plants use solar ener gy to\nperform photosynthesis. Now, with the\nhelp of photovoltaic cells,  solar energy\ncan be converted into electricity. These\ncells use special kind of materials to\ncapture solar energy and then convert\nthe energy into electricity. This\ntechnology is extremely useful for remote\nareas and for places where supply of\npower through grid or power lines is\neither not possible or proves very costly.\nThis technique is also totally free from\npollution.  In recent years India is taking\nefforts to increase the power generation\nthrough solar . India is also leading an\nInternational body called International\nSolar Alliance (ISA).\nMini-hydel Plants:  In mountainous\nregions, streams can be found almost\neverywhere. A large percentage of such\nstreams are perennial. Mini-hydel\nplants use the energy of such streams\nto move small turbines. The turbines\ngenerate electricity which can be used\nlocally. Such power plants are more or\nless environment-friendly as they do not\nchange the land use pattern in areas\nwhere they are located; they generate\nenough power to meet local demands.\nThis means that they can also do away\nwith the need for large scale\ntransmission towers and cables and\navoid transmission loss.Traditional Knowledge and\nPractices: Traditionally, Indian people\nhave been close to their environment.\nThey have been more a component of\nthe envir onment and not its contr oller.\nIf we look back at our agriculture\nsystem, healthcare system, housing,\ntransport etc., we find that all practices\nhave been environment friendly. Only\nrecently have we drifted away from the\ntraditional systems and caused large\nscale damage to the environment and\nalso our  rural heritage. Now, it is time\nto go back. One apt example is in\nhealthcare. India is very much\nprivileged to have  about 15,000 species\nof plants which have medicinal\nproperties. About 8,000 of these are in\nregular use in various systems of\ntreatment including the folk tradition.\nWith the sudden onslaught of the\nwestern system of treatment, we\nignored our traditional systems such\nas Ayurveda, Unani, Tibetan and folk\nsystems.

In certain parts of the\ncountry, cattle are maintained only\nbecause they produce dung which is\nan important fertiliser and soil\nconditioner.\nEarthworms can convert organic\nmatter into compost faster than the\nnormal composting process. This\nprocess is now being widely used.\nIndirectly, the civic authorities are\nbenefited too as they have to dispose\nreduced quantity of waste.\nBiopest Control:   With the advent of\ngreen revolution, the entire country\nentered into a frenzy to use more and\nmore chemical pesticides for higher\nyield. Soon, the adverse impacts began\nto show; food products were\ncontaminated, soil, water bodies and\neven ground water were polluted with\npesticides. Even milk, meat and fishes\nwere found to be contaminated.\nTo meet this challenge, efforts are\non to bring in better methods of pest\ncontrol. One such step is the use of\npesticides based on plant products.\nNeem trees are proving to be quite\nuseful. Several types of pest controlling\nchemicals have been isolated from neem\nand these are being used. Mixed\ncropping and growing different crops\nin consecutive years on the same land\nhave also helped farmers.In addition, awareness is spreading\nabout various animals and birds which\nhelp in controlling pests. For example,\nsnakes are one of the prime group of\nanimals which prey upon rats, mice and\nvarious other pests. Similarly, large\nvarieties of birds, for example, owls and\npeacocks, prey upon vermin and pests.\nIf these are allowed to dwell around the\nagricultural areas, they can clear large\nvarieties of pests including insects.\nLizards are also important in this\nregard.

W e also studied the kind of\npolicies India adopted, which had\nvarying impacts in different sectors.\nOver the last two decades or so, the\neconomic transformation that is taking\nplace in different countries across the\nworld, partly because of the process\nof globalisation, has both short as\nwell as long-term implications for\neach country, including India. Nations\nhave been primarily trying to adopt\nvarious means which will strengthen\ntheir own domestic economies. To this\neffect, they are forming regional and\nglobal economic groupings such as\nthe SAARC, European Union,\nASEAN, G-8, G-20 , BRICS etc. In\naddition, there is also an increasing\neagerness on the parts of various\nnations to try and understand the\ndevelopmental processes pursued by\ntheir neighbouring nations as it\nallows them to better comprehend\ntheir own strengths and weaknesses\nvis-à-vis their neighbours. In the\nunfolding process of globalisation,\nthis is particularly considered\nessential by developing countries as\nthey face competition not only from\ndeveloped nations but also amongst\nthemselves in the relatively limited\neconomic space enjoyed by the\ndeveloping world. Besides, anunderstanding of the other economies\nin our neighbourhood is also required\nas all major common economic\nactivities in the region impinge on\noverall human development in a\nshared environment.\nIn this chapter we will compare the\ndevelopmental strategies pursued by\nIndia and the largest two of its\nneighbouring economies—Pakistan\nand China. It has to be remembered\nthat despite being endowed with vast\nnatural resources , there is little\nsimilarity between the political power\nsetup of India  - the largest democracy\nof the world which is wedded to a\nsecular and deeply liberal Constitution\nfor more than  half a century, and the\nmilitarist political power structure of\nPakistan or the command economy\nof China that has only recently\nstarted moving towards a democratic\nsystem and more liberal economic\nrestructuring respectively.\n8.2 D EVELOPMENTAL  PATH—A\nSNAPSHOT  VIEW\nDo you know that India, Pakistan and\nChina have many similarities in their\ndevelopmental strategies? All the three\nnations have started towards their\ndevelopmental path at the same time.\nWhile India and Pakistan became\nindependent nations in 1947, People’s\nRepublic of China was established in\n1949. In a speech at that time,Geography has made us neighbours. History has made us friends. Economics\nhas made us partners, and necessity has made us allies.

While India\nannounced its first Five Y ear Plan for\n1951 –56, Pakistan announced its first\nfive year plan, now called the Medium\nTerm Development Plan, in 1956.\nChina announced its First Five Y ear\nPlan in 1953. Since 2018, Pakistan is\nworking on the basis of 12th Five Year\nDevelopment  Plan (2018–23),  whereas ,\nChina  is working on 14th Five Y ear\nPlan (2021–25) . Until March 2017,\nIndia has been following Five Y ear\nPlan- based development model . India\nand Pakistan adopted similar\nstrategies , such as creating a large\npublic sector and raising public\nexpenditure on social development.\nTill the 1980s, all the thr ee countries\nhad similar growth rates and per capita\nincomes. Where do they stand today\nin comparison to one another? Before\nwe answer this question , let us trace\nthe historical path of developmental\npolicies in China and Pakistan. After\nstudying the last three units, we\nalready know what policies India has\nbeen adopting since its Independence.\nChina:  After the establishment of\nPeople’s Republic of China under one-\nparty rule, all critical sectors of the\neconomy, enterprises and lands owned\nand operated by individuals were\nbrought under government control.The Great Leap Forward  (GLF)\ncampaign initiated in 1958 aimed at\nindustrialising the country on a\nmassive scale. People were encouraged\nto set up industries in their backyards.\nIn rural areas, communes were\nstarted. Under the Commune system,\npeople collectively cultivated lands. In\n1958, there were 26,000 communes\ncovering almost all the farm\npopulation.\nGLF campaign met with many\nproblems. A severe drought caused\nhavoc in China killing about 30 million\npeople. When Russia had conflicts with\nChina, it withdrew its professionals\nwho had earlier been sent to China to\nhelp in the industrialisation process.\nIn 1965, Mao introduced the Great\nProletarian Cultural Revolution\n(1966 –76) under which  students and\nprofessionals were sent to work and\nlearn from the countryside.\nThe present day fast industrial\ngrowth in China can be traced back to\nthe reforms introduced in 1978. China\nintroduced reforms in phases. In the\ninitial phase, reforms were initiated in\nagriculture, foreign trade and\ninvestment sectors. In agriculture, for\ninstance, commune lands were divided\ninto small plots, which were allocated\n(for use not ownership) to individual\nhouseholds. They were allowed to keep\nall income from the land after paying\nstipulated taxes. In the later phase,\nreforms were initiated in the industrial\nsector . Private sector fir ms, in general ,\nand township and village enterprises,\ni.e., those enterprises which were\nowned and operated by local collectives ,\nin particular , were allowed to pr oduce\n2024-25"

At this stage, enterprises  owned\nby government (known as State Owned\nEnterprises—SOEs), which we ,  in\nIndia , call public sector enterprises,\nwere made to face competition. The\nreform process also involved dual\npricing. This means fixing the prices in\ntwo ways;  farmers and industrial units\nwere required to buy and sell fixed\nquantities of inputs and outputs on the\nbasis of prices fixed by the government\nand the rest were purchased and sold\nat market prices. Over the years, as\nproduction increased, the proportion of\ngoods or inputs transacted in the\nmarket also increased.  In order to\nattract foreign investors, special\neconomic zones  were set up.\nPakista n: While looking at various\neconomic policies that Pakistan\nadopted, you will notice many\nsimilarities with India. Pakistan also\nfollows the mixed economy model withco-existence of public and private\nsectors. In the late 1950s and 1960s,\nPakistan introduced a variety of\nregulated policy framework (for import\nsubstitution-based industrialisation).\nThe policy combined tariff protection for\nmanufacturing of consumer goods\ntogether with direct import controls on\ncompeting imports. The introduction of\nGreen Revolution led to mechanisation\nand increase in public investment in\ninfrastructure in select areas, which\nfinally led to  a rise in the production of\nfoodgrains. This changed the agrarian\nstructure dramatically. In the 1970s,\nnationalisation  of capital goods\nindustries took place. Pakistan then\nshifted its policy orientation in the late\n1970s and 1980s when the major\nthrust areas were denationalisation\nand encouragement of private sector .\nDuring this period, Pakistan also\nreceived financial support from western\nnations and remittances from\nFig. 8.1 Wagah Bor der is not only a tourist place but also used for\ntrade between India and Pakistan\n2024-25"

The then government\nalso offered incentives to the private\nsector . All this cr eated a conducive\nclimate for new investments. In 1988,\nreforms were initiated in the country.\nHaving studied a brief outline of\nthe developmental strategies of China\nand Pakistan, let us now compare\nsome of the developmental indicators\nof India, China and Pakistan.\n8.3 D EMOGRAPHIC  INDICATORS\nIf we look at the global population, out\nof every six persons living in this\nworld, one is an Indian and another a\nChinese. W e shall compar e some\ndemographic indicators of India,\nChina and Pakistan.  The population\nof Pakistan is very small and accounts\nfor roughly about one-tenth of China\nor India.\nThough China is the largest nation\nand geographically occupies the largest\narea among the three nations, its\ndensity is the lowest. Table 8.1  showsthe population growth as being the\nhighest in Pakistan, followed by India\nand China. Scholars point out the one-\nchild norm introduced in China in the\nlate 1970s as the major reason for  low\npopulation growth. They also state that\nthis measure led to a decline in the sex\nratio, the proportion of females per\n1000 males. However , from the table,\nyou will notice that the sex ratio is low\nand biased against females in all three\ncountries. Scholars cite son preference\nprevailing in all these countries as the\nreason. In recent times, all three\ncountries are adopting various\nmeasures to improve the situation. One-\nchild norm and the resultant  arrest in\nthe growth of population also have other\nimplications. For instance, after a few\ndecades, in China, there will be more\nelderly people  in proportion  to young\npeople. This led China to allow couples\nto have two children.\nThe fertility rate is also low in\nChina and very high in Pakistan.\nUrbanisation is high in China with\nIndia having 34 per cent of its people\nliving in urban areas.\nTABLE 8.1\nSelect Demographic Indicators, 2017-18\nCountry Estimated Annual Density Sex Fertility Urbanisation\nPopulation Growth of (per sq. km) Ratio Rate\n(in million) Population\nIndia 1352 1.03 455 924 2.2 34\nChina 1393 0.46 148 949 1.7 59\nPakistan  212 2.05 275 943 3.6 37\nSource:  World Development Indicators 2019, www.worldbank.org\n2024-25"

Some scholars hold the\nreform processes introduced in\nPakistan and political instability  over\na long period as  reason s behind th e\ndeclining growth rate in Pakistan . We\nwill study in  a later section which\nsector contributed to different growth\nrates in these countries.\nFirst, look at how people engaged in\ndifferent sectors contribute to the Gross\nDomestic Product  now called as Gross\nValue Added . It was pointed out in the\nprevious section that China andPakistan have more\nproportion of\nurban population than\nIndia. In China, due to\ntopographic and climatic\nconditions, the area\nsuitable for cultivation is\nrelatively small  — only\nabout 10 per cent of its\ntotal land area. The total\ncultivable area in China\naccounts for 40 per cent\nof the cultivable area in\nIndia. Until the 1980s,\nmore than 80 per cent of\nthe people in China were\ndependent on farming\nas their sole source\nof livelihood. Since\nthen, the government\nencouraged people\nto leave their fields\nand pursue other\nactivities such as\nhandicrafts, commerce\nand transport.   In 2018–\n19, with 26 per cent of its workforce\nengaged in  agriculture,  its contribution\nto the GVA in China is 7 per cent (see\nTable 8.3).\nIn both India and Pakistan, the\ncontribution of agriculture to GVA were\n16 and 24 per cent, respectively, but\nthe proportion of workforce that works\nin this sector is more in India. In\nPakistan, about 41 per cent of people\nwork in agriculture, whereas, in India,\nit is 43 per cent. Twenty four per cent\nof Pakistan workforce is engaged in\nindustry but it produces 19 per cent\nof GVA. In India, industry workforce\nFig. 8.3 Industry in India, China and Pakistan(Not to scale)\n2024-25"

In\nChina, industries contribute to GVA at\n41, and employ 28 per cent of\nworkforce. In all the three countries,\nservice sector contributes highest share\nof GVA.\nIn the normal course of\ndevelopment, countries first shift their\nemployment and output from\nagriculture to Industry  and then to\nservices. This is what is happening in\nChina as can be seen from Table 8.3.\nThe proportion of workforce engaged\nin industry  in India and Pakistan were\nlow at 25 per cent  and 24 per cent\nrespectively . The contribution of\nindustries to G VA is at 30 per cent in\nIndia and 19 per cent in Pakistan . In\nthese countries , the shift is taking place\ndirectly to the service sector.\nThus,  in all the three countries the\nservice sector is emerging as a major\nplayer of development. It contributes\nmore to G VA and, at the same time,\nemerges as a prospective employer. If\nwe look at the proportion of workforce\nin the1980s, Pakistan was faster in\nshifting its workforce to service sector\nthan India and China. In the 1980s,India, China and  Pakistan employed\n17, 12 and 27 per cent of its workforce\nin the service sector respectively.

In the industrial sector, China\nhas maintained a near double-digit\ngrowth rate in 1980s but began\nshowing decline in recent years,TABLE 8.3\nSectoral Share of Employment and GVA (%) in 2018–2019\nSector Contribution to GVA Distribution of Workforce\nIndia China Pakistan India China Pakistan\nAgriculture 16 7 24 43 26 41\nIndustry 30 41 19 25 28 24\nServices 54 52\n57 32 46 35\nTotal 100 100 100 100 100 100\nSource:  Human Development Report 2019 ; Key Indicators of Asia and Pacific 2019.\nWork These Out\nØDo you think it is necessary\nfor India and Pakistan to\nconcentrate on  the  manu-\nfacturing sector as China\ndoes?

In case of service\nsector, China was able to maintain its\nrate of growth during 1980–1990,while\nthere was a positive and increasing\ngrowth of India’s service sector output.\nThus, China’s growth is contributed\nby the manufacturing and service\nsectors and India’s growth by the\nservice sector. During this period,\nPakistan has shown deceleration in all\nthree sectors.8.5 INDICATORS  OF HUMAN\nDEVELOPMENT\nYou might have studied about the\nimportance of human development\nindicators in the lower classes and the\nposition of many developed and\ndeveloping countries.

Find out for yourself how\nthese dif ferences occur .\nIn dealing with or making\njudgements on such questions,\nhowever , we should also note a pr oblem\nwhile using the human development\nindicators given above with conviction.\nThis occurs because these are all\nextremely important indicators; but\nthese are not sufficient. Along with\nthese, we also need what may be called\n‘liberty indicators’. One such indicator\nhas actually been added as a measure\nof ‘the extent of democratic\nparticipation in social and politica l\ndecision-making ’ but it has not been\ngiven any extra weight. Some obvious\n‘liberty indicators’ like measures of  ‘theextent of Constitutional protection\ngiven to rights of citizens’ or ‘the extent\nof constitutional protection of\nthe Independence of the Judiciary and\nthe Rule of Law’  have not even\nbeen intr oduced so far . Without\nincluding these (and perhaps some\nmore) and giving them overriding\nimportance in the list, the construction\nof a human development index may\nbe said to be incomplete and its\nusefulness limited.\n8.6 D EVELOPMENT  STRATEGIES  — AN\nAPPRAISAL\nIt is common to find developmental\nstrategies of a country as a model to\nothers for lessons and guidance for\ntheir own development. It is particularly\nevident after the introduction of the\nreform process in different parts of the\nworld. In order to learn from economic\nperformance of our neighbouring\ncountries, it is necessary to have an\nunderstanding of the roots of their\nsuccesses and failures. It is also\nnecessary to distinguish between, and\ncontrast, the different phases of their\nstrategies. Though countries go\nthrough their development phases\ndifferently, let us take the initiation of\nreforms as a point of r eference. W e\nknow that reforms were initiated in\nChina in 1978, Pakistan in 1988 and\nIndia in 1991. Let us briefly assess their\nachievements and failures in pre- and\npost-reform periods.\nWhy did China introduce\nstructural reforms in 1978?

The new\nleadership at that time in China was\nnot happy with the slow pace of growth\nand lack of modernisation in the\nChinese economy under the Maoist\nrule. They felt that Maoist vision of\neconomic development based on\ndecentralisation, self sufficiency and\nshunning of foreign technology, goods\nand capital had failed. Despite\nextensive land reforms, collectivisation,\nthe Great Leap Forward and other\ninitiatives, the per capita grain output\nin 1978 was the same as it was in the\nmid-1950s.\nIt was found that establishment of\ninfrastructure in the areas of\neducation and health, land reforms,\nlong existence of decentralised\nplanning and existence of small\nenterprises had helped positively in\nimproving the social and income\nindicators in the post reform period.\nBefore the introduction of reforms,\nthere had already been massive\nextension of basic health services in\nrural areas.  Through the commune\nsystem, there was more equitable\ndistribution of food grains.

It created conditions for the\nsubsequent phenomenal growth in\nrural industries and built up a strong\nsupport base for more reforms.\nScholars quote many such examples\non how reform measures led to rapid\ngrowth in China.\n Scholars argue that in Pakistan\nthe reform process led to worsening of\nall the economic indicators. W e have\nseen in an earlier section that\ncompared to 1980s, the growth rate\nof GDP and its sectoral constituents\nhave not yet improved .\nThough the data on international\npoverty line for Pakistan is quite\nhealthy,  scholars using the official\ndata of Pakistan indicate rising\npoverty there. The proportion of poor\nin 1960s was more than 40 per cent\nwhich declined to 25 per cent in 1980s\nand started rising again in the recent\ndecades . The reasons for the slow -\ndown of growth and re-emergence of\npoverty in Pakistan’s economy, as\nscholars put it, are  agricultural growth\nand food supply situation were based\nnot  on a n institutionalised process of\ntechnical change but on good harvest.\nWhen there was a good harvest, the\neconomy was in good condition, when\nit was not, the economic indicators\nshowed stagnation or negative trends .\nYou will r ecall that India had to borr ow\nfrom  the IMF and W orld Bank to\nset right its balance of payments\ncrisis; foreign exchange is an essential\ncomponent for any country and it is\n2024-25"

If a country is able to build up\nits foreign exchange earnings by\nsustainable export of manufactured\ngoods, it need not worry. In Pakistan\nmost foreign exchange earnings came\nfrom remittances from Pakistani\nworkers in the Middle-east and the\nexports of highly volatile agricultural\nproducts; there was also growing\ndependence on foreign loans on the one\nhand and increasing difficulty in paying\nback the loans on the other.\nHowever, during the last few years,\nPakistan has recovered its economic\ngrowth and has been sustaining. In\n2017-18, the Annual Plan 2019-20\nreports that, the GDP registered a\ngrowth of 5.5 per cent, highest when\ncompared to the previous decade. While\nagriculture recorded growth rate far\nfrom satisfactory level, industrial and\nservice sectors grew at 4.9 and 6.2 per\ncent respectively. Many macroeconomic\nindicators also began to show stable\nand positive trends.\n8.7 C ONCLUSION\nWhat are we learning from the\ndevelopmental experiences of our\nneighbours? India, China and\nPakistan have travelled seven decades\nof developmental path with varied\nresults. T ill the late 1970s, all of them\nwere maintaining the same level of low\ndevelopment. The last three decades\nhave taken these countries to differentlevels. India, with democratic\ninstitutions,  performed moderately,\nbut a majority of its people still depend\non agriculture. India has taken many\ninitiatives to develop the infrastructure\nand improve the standard of living.\nScholars are of the opinion that\npolitical instability, over -dependence\non remittances and foreign aid along\nwith volatile performance of\nagriculture sector are the reasons for\nthe slowdown of the Pakistan\neconomy. Y et, last five years, many\nmacroeconomic indicators began\nshowing positive and moderate growth\nrates reflecting the economic recovery.\nIn China, the lack of political freedom\nand its implications for human rights\nare major concerns; yet, in the last four\ndecades, it used the ‘market system\nwithout losing political commitment’\nand succeeded in raising the level of\ngrowth alongwith alleviation of poverty.\nYou will also notice that unlike India\nand Pakistan, which are attempting to\nprivatise their public sector\nenterprises, China has used the\nmarket mechanism to ‘create\nadditional social and economic\nopportunities’. By retaining collective\nownership of land and allowing\nindividuals to cultivate lands, China\nhas ensured social security in rural\nareas. Public intervention in providing\nsocial infrastructure even prior to\nreforms has brought about positive\nresults in human development\nindicators in China.\n2024-25"

However, the structures established to implement\ndevelopmental policies are quite different.\nØTill the early 1980s, the developmental indicators of all the three\ncountries, such as growth rates and sectoral contribution towards\nnational income, were similar.\nØReforms were introduced in 1978 in China, in 1988 in Pakistan and in\n1991 in India.\nØChina introduced structural reforms on its own initiative while they\nwere forced upon India and Pakistan by international agencies.\nØThe impact of policy measures were different in these countries — for\ninstance, one-child norm has arrested the population growth in China\nwhereas in India and Pakistan, a major change is yet to take place.\nØEven after seventy years of planned development, majority of the\nworkforce in all the countries depends on agriculture. The dependency\nis greater in India.\nØThough China has followed the classical development pattern of\ngradual shift from agriculture to manufacturing and then to services,\nIndia and Pakistan’s shift has been directly from agriculture to service\nsector.\nØChina’s industrial sector has maintained a high growth rate while it\nis not so in both India and Pakistan. This led to rapid increase of the\nGDP per capita in China than in India and Pakistan.\nØChina is ahead of India and Pakistan on many human development\nindicators. However these improvements were attributed not to the\nreform process but the strategies that China adopted in the pre-reform\nperiod.\nØWhile assessing the developmental indicators, one also has to consider\nthe liberty indicators.\n2024-25"
