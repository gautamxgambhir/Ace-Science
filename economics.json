They\nhave to understand that people have\ndifferent perspectives on development and\nthere are ways by which we can arrive at\ncommon indicators for development. To\ndo this, we have used situations that they\ncan respond to in an intuitive manner; we\nhave also presented analysis that is more\ncomplex and macro in nature.\nHow can countries or states be\ncompared using some selected\ndevelopment indicators is another\nquestion that students would read\nabout in this chapter. Economic\ndevelopment can be measured and\nincome is the most common method\nfor measuring development. However,\nthe income method, though useful,\nhas several weaknesses. Hence, we\nneed newer ways of looking at\ndevelopment using indicators of\nquality of life and environmental\nsustainability.\nIt is necessary for you to expect the\nstudents to respond actively in the\nclassroom and on a topic such as the\nabove, there would be wide variation in\nopinion and possibility of debate. Allow\nstudents to argue their point of view. At\nthe end of each section there are a few\nquestions and activities. These serve two\npurposes: first, they recap the ideas\ndiscussed in the section and second, theyenable better understanding of the themes\ndiscussed by bringing the learners closer\nto their real life situations.\nThere are certain terms used in this\nchapter that would require clarification —\nPer Capita Income, Literacy Rate, Infant\nMortality Rate, Attendance Ratio, Life\nExpectancy, Gross Enrolment Ratio, and\nHuman Development Index. Though data\npertaining to these terms are provided,\nthese would need further explanation. Y ou\nmay also need to clarify the concept of\nPurchasing Power Parity that is used to\ncalculate Gross National Income per capita\nin Table 1.6. It is necessary to keep in mind\nthat these terms are used as an aid to the\ndiscussion and not something to be\nmemorised.\nSources for Information\nThe data for this chapter is taken from\nreports published by the Government of\nIndia ( Economic Survey , Reports of the\nNational Family Health Survey and\nHandbook of Statistics on the Indian\nEconomy), United Nations Development\nProgramme ( Human Development Report )\nand W orld Bank ( World Development\nIndicators ). Many of these reports are\npublished every year . It may be inter esting\nto look up these reports if they are\navailable in your school library. If not, you\nmay log on to the websites of these\ninstitutions (www.budgetindia.nic.in,\nwww.undp.org,www.worldbank.org,\nwww.rbi.org).\n2 22 22 U UUUUNDERSTNDERSTNDERST NDERSTNDERST ANDING ANDINGANDING ANDINGANDING  E  E E  E ECONOMICCONOMICCONOMICCONOMICCONOMIC  D  D D  D DEVEL EVELEVEL EVELEVEL OPMENT OPMENTOPMENT OPMENTOPMENT\n2024-25"

Similarly, we have ideas\nabout what a country should be like.\nWhat are the essential things that we\nrequire? Can life be better for all? How\nshould people live together? Can there\nbe more equality? Development\ninvolves thinking about these\nquestions and about the ways in\nwhich we can work towards achieving\nthese goals.

Why do different persons have different notions of development? Which of the following\nexplanations is more important and why?\n(a) Because people are different.\n(b) Because life situations of persons are different.\n2.Do the following two st atements mean the same?

If you\nget a job in a far off place, before\naccepting it you would try to consider\nmany factors, apart from income,\nsuch as facilities for your family,\nworking atmosphere, or opportunity\nto learn. In another case, a job may\ngive you less pay but may offer regular\nemployment that enhances your\nsense of security. Another job,\nhowever , may of fer high pay but no\njob security and also leave no time for\nyour family. This will reduce your\nsense of security and freedom.Similarly, for development,\npeople look at a mix of goals . It is\ntrue that if women are engaged in paid\nwork, their dignity in the household\nand society increases. However , it is\nalso the case that if there is respect\nfor women there would be more\nsharing of housework and a\ngreater acceptance of women\nworking outside. A safe and secure\nenvironment may allow more women\nto take up a variety of jobs or run\na business.\nHence, the developmental goals\nthat people have are not only about\nbetter income but also about other\nimportant things in life.\nIf, as we have seen above, individuals\nseek different goals, then their notion\nof national development is also likely\nto be different. Discuss among\nyourselves on what India should do\nfor development.\nMost likely, you would find that\ndifferent students in the class have given\ndifferent answers to the above question.\nIn fact, you might yourself think of\nmany different answers and not be too\nsure of any of these. It is very\nimportant to keep in mind thatdifferent persons could have\ndifferent as well as conflicting\nnotions of a country’s development.\nHowever , can all the ideas be\nconsider ed equally important?

Before we come to this,\nlet us consider another question.\nWhen we compare different things,\nthey could have similarities as well as\ndifferences. Which aspects do we use\nto compare them? Let us look at\nstudents in the class itself.  How do\nwe compare different students?  They\ndiffer in their height, health, talents\nand interests. The healthiest student\nmay not be the most studious one.\nThe most intelligent student may not\nbe the friendliest one.  So, how do we\ncompare students? The criterion we\nmay use depends on the purpose of\ncomparison.  W e use dif ferent criterion\nto choose a sports team, a debate\nteam, a music team or a team to\norganise a picnic.  Still, if for some\npurpose, we have to choose the\ncriterion for the all-round progress of\nchildren in the class, how shall we\ndo it?\nUsually we take one or more\nimportant characteristics of\npersons and compare them based\non these characteristics.  Of\ncourse, there can be differences about\nwhat are important characteristics\nthat should form the basis of\ncomparison: friendliness and spirit of\ncooperation, creativity or marks\nsecured?\nThis is true of development too.\nFor comparing countries, their\nincome is considered to be one of\nthe most important attributes.\nCountries with higher income aremore developed than others with less\nincome. This is based on the\nunderstanding that more income\nmeans more of all things that human\nbeings need.  Whatever people like,\nand should have, they will be able to\nget with greater income. So, greater\nincome itself is considered to be one\nimportant goal.\nNow, what is the income of a\ncountry? Intuitively, the income of the\ncountry is the income of all the\nresidents of the country.  This gives\nus the total income of the country.\nHowever , for comparison between\ncountries, total income is not such a n\nuseful measure. Since , countries have\ndifferent populations, comparing total\nincome will not tell us what an average\nperson is likely to earn. Are people in\none country better off than others in a\ndifferent country? Hence , we compare\nthe average income  which is the total\nincome of the country divided by its\ntotal population. The average income\nis also called per capita income.\nIn W orld Development Reports,\nbrought out by the W orld Bank, this\ncriterion is used in classifying\ncountries. Countries with per capita\nincome of US$ 49,300 per annum and\nabove in 2019, are called high income\nor rich countries and those with per\ncapita income of US$ 2500 or less are\ncalled low-income countries. India\ncomes in the category of low middle\nincome countries because its per\ncapita income in 201 9 was just\nUS$ 6700 per annum. The rich\ncountries, excluding countries of\nMiddle East and certain other small\ncountries, are generally called\ndeveloped countries.HOW TO COMP ARE DIFFERENT COUNTRIES\nOR ST ATES?\n2024-25"

The\nfirst column of the table shows that in\nKerala, out of 10 00 children born , 7\ndied before completing one year of age\nbut in Haryana  the proportion of\nchildren dying within one year of birth\nwas 30, which is nearly three times\nmore than that of Kerala . On the other\nhand, the per capita income of\nHaryana is  more  than that of Kerala\nas shown in Table 1.3. Just think of\nhow dear you are to your parents,\nthink of how every one is so happy\nwhen a child i s born.  Now, try to think\nof parents whose children die before\nthey even celebrate their first birthday.\nHow painful i t must be to these\nparents?  Next, note the year to which\nthis data pertains. It is 2018.   So we\nare not talking of old times; it is 70\nyears after independence  when our\nmetro cities  are full of high  rise\nbuildings and shopping malls!\nHow is it that the average person in\nHaryana has more income than the\naverage person in Kerala but lags\nbehind in these crucial areas? The\nreason is — money in your pocket\ncannot buy all the goods and services\nthat you may need to live well.   So,\nincome by itself is not a completely\nadequate indicator of material goods\nand services that citizens are able\nto use.  For example, normally, your\nmoney cannot buy you a pollution-\nfree environment or ensure that you\nget unadulterated medicines, unless\nyou can afford to shift to a\ncommunity that already has all these\nthings.  Money may also not be able\nto protect you from infectious\ndiseases, unless the whole of your\ncommunity takes preventive steps.The problem does not end with\nInfant Mortality Rate. The last column\nof table 1.4 shows that about half  of\nthe children aged 14-15 in Bihar are\nnot  attending school beyond Class 8.\nThis means that if you went to school\nin Bihar nearly half  of your elementary\nclass friends would be missing. Those\nwho could have been in school are not\nthere! If this had happened to you, you\nwould not be able to read what you\nare reading now.\nActually for many of the important\nthings in life the best way, also the\ncheapest way, is to provide these\ngoods and services collectively. Just\nthink – will it be cheaper to have\ncollective security for the whole\nlocality or for each house to have its\nown security staff?  What if no one,\nother than you, in your village or\nlocality is interested in studying?\nWould you be able to study? Not\nunless your parents could afford to\nsend you to some private school\nelsewhere.  So you are actually able\nto study because many other children\nalso want to study and because many\npeople believe that the government\nshould open schools and provide\nother facilities so that all children\nhave a chance to study. Even now,\nin many areas, children, particularly\ngirls, are not able to go to high school\nbecause the government/society has\nnot provided adequate facilities.\nMost babies require basic healthcare\n2024-25"

There could\nbe a long list of such criterion but\nthen it would not be so useful. What\nwe need is a small number of the\nmost important things. Health and\neducation indicators, such as the\nones we used in comparison of Kerala\nand Haryana, are among them. Over\nthe past decade or so, health and\neducation indicators have come to\nbe widely used along with income as\na measure of development. For\ninstance, Human Development\nReport published by UNDP  compares\ncountries based on the educational\nlevels of the people, their health\nstatus and per capita income. It\nwould be interesting to look at\ncertain relevant data regarding India\nand its neighbours from Human\nDevelopment Report 20 21-22 .\nTABLE 1.6 SOME DA TA REGARDING INDIA  AND ITS NEIGHBOURS\nFOR 2021\nCountry Gross National Life Mean Years of HDI Rank in\nIncome (GNI) Expectancy Schooling of the world\nper capita at birth People aged 25 (2021-22)\n (2017 PPP $) and above\nSri Lanka 12,578 76.4 10.8 73\nIndia 6,590 67.2 6.7 132\nMyanmar 3,851 65.7 6.4 149\nPakistan 4,624 66.1 4.5 161\nNepal 3,877 68.4 5.1 143\nBangladesh 5,472 72.4 7.4 129\nSource : Human Development Report, 2021-22, United Nations Development Programme, New York.\nNOTES\n1.HDI stands for Human Development Index.

This is easy to calculate. Let each student in\nthe class find out his or her weight and height. Take the\nweight of each student in kilograms (kg). Then, take\nthe height by drawing up a scale on the wall and\nmeasuring accurately with the head straight. Convert\nthe height recorded in centimeters into meters. Divide\nthe weight in kg by the square of the height. The number\nyou get is called BMI. Then, look at the BMI-for-Age\ntables given on pages\n90–91. A student’ s BMI\ncould be within the normal\nrange or less than that\n(underweight) or more\n(obesity). For example, if\na girl student is 14 years\nand 8 month old and the\nBMI is 15.2, then she is\nundernourished.  Similarly ,\nif the BMI of a boy aged\n15 years and 6 months is\n28, then he is overweight.\nDiscuss the life situation,\nfood and exercise  habits\nof students, in general,\nwithout body shaming\nanyone.\n2024-25"

Sectoral\nclassification can be done on the basis of\nseveral criteria. In this chapter , thr ee\ntypes of classifications are discussed:\nprimary/secondary/tertiary; organised/\nunorganised; and public/private. Y ou can\ncreate a discussion about these types by\ntaking examples familiar to the students\nand relate them to their daily life. It is\nimportant to emphasise the changing\nroles of sectors. This can be highlighted\nfurther by drawing attention of the\nstudents to the rapid growth of service\nsector . While elaborating the ideas\nprovided in the chapter , the students may\nneed to be familiarised with a few\nfundamental concepts such as Gross\nDomestic Product, Employment etc. Since\nthe students may find this difficult to\nunderstand, it is necessary to explain to\nthem through examples. Several activities\nand exercises are suggested in the chapter\nto help the students understand how a\nperson’s activity could be placed —\nwhether in the primary, secondary or\ntertiary, organised or unorganised, and\npublic or private sector . You may\nencourage the students to talk to various\nworking people around them (such as\nshop owners, casual workers, vegetable\nvendors, workshop mechanics, domestic\nworkers etc.) to know more about how they\nlive and work. Based on such information,\nthe students can be encouraged to\ndevelop their own classification of\neconomic activities.\nAnother important issue to be\nhighlighted is about the problems caused\nby the changes in the roles of sectors.\nThe chapter has taken the example of\nunemployment and what the government\ncan do to solve it. The declining importance\nof agriculture and growing importance ofindustry and services should be related\nto the experience of the children by taking\nmore examples that they may observe in\ntheir day-to-day life. Information derived\nfrom the media could be used for this\npurpose. Y ou may encourage the students\nto bring important cuttings and stories\nfrom newspapers, which could be\nprominently displayed in storyboards, and\nencourage the class to discuss these\nissues. While discussing the unorganised\nsector , the key issue of pr otecting the\nworkers engaged in the sector should be\nhighlighted. Y ou may  also encourage the\nstudents to visit persons and enterprises\nin the unorganised sector and get a first\nhand experience from real life situation.\nSources for Information\nThe GDP data used in this chapter\npertaining to Gross Domestic Product at\nFactor Cost by Industry of Origin at\n2011–12  prices is taken fr om Real T ime\nHandbook of Statistics on Indian Economy .\nIt is a valuable source of GDP and other\ninformation relating to the Indian economy.\nFor evaluation purposes, particularly to\ndevelop the analytical ability of learners,\nteachers can refer to this report through\nthe Internet to get data for different years.\nDue to change in methodology, latest data\nis not used in the chapter .\nThe employment figures are based\non data taken from the five-yearly surveys\non employment and unemployment\nconducted by the National Sample Survey\nOrganisation (NSSO) now known as\nNational Statistical Office (NSO). NSO is\nan organisation under the Ministry of\nStatistics and Programme Implementation,\nGovernment of India. The website you can\nlog onto is: http:/mospi.gov.in.

Take, for\nexample, the cultivation of cotton. It\ntakes place within a crop season. For\nthe growth of the cotton plant, we\ndepend mainly, but not entirely,\non natural factors like rainfall,\nsunshine and climate. The product\nof this activity, cotton, is a natural\nproduct. Similarly, in the case of an\nactivity like dairy, we are dependent\non the biological process of\nthe animals and availability\nof fodder etc. The product\nhere, milk, also is a natural\nproduct. Similarly , minerals\nand ores are also natural\nproducts. When we produce\na good by exploiting natural\nresources, it is an activity of\nthe primary sector . Why\nprimary? This is because it\nforms the base for all\nother products that we\nsubsequently make. Since\nmost of the natural\nproducts we get are from\nagriculture, dairy, fishing,\nforestry, this sector is also\ncalled agriculture and related\nsector .\nThe secondary sector  covers\nactivities in which natural  products\nare changed into other forms through\nways of manufacturing that we\nassociate with industrial activity. It is\nthe next step after primary. The\nproduct is not produced by nature\nbut has to be made and therefore\nsome process of manufacturing is\nessential. This could be in a factory, a\nworkshop or at home.  For example,\nusing cotton fibre from the plant, wespin yarn and weave cloth. Using\nsugarcane as a raw material, we make\nsugar or gur. We convert earth into\nbricks and use bricks to make houses\nand buildings. Since this sector\ngradually became associated with the\ndifferent kinds of industries that came\nup, it is also called as industrial sector .\nAfter primary and secondary, there\nis a third category of activities that falls\nunder tertiary sector  and is different\nfrom the above two. These are\nactivities that help in the development\nof the primary and secondary sectors.\nThese activities, by themselves, do not\nproduce a good but they are an aid\nor a support for the production\nprocess. For example, goods that are\nproduced in the primary or secondary\nsector would need to be transported\nby trucks or trains and then sold in\nwholesale and retail shops. At times,\nit may be necessary to store these in\ngodowns. W e also may need to talk to\nothers over telephone or send letters\n(communication) or borrow money\nfrom banks (banking) to help\nproduction and trade. T ransport,\nstorage, communication, banking,\ntrade are some examples of tertiary\nactivities. Since these activities\ngenerate services rather than goods,\nthe tertiary sector is also called the\nservice sector .\nService sector also includes some\nessential services that may not directly\nhelp in the production of goods. For\nexample, we require teachers, doctors,\nand those who provide personal\nservices such as washermen, barbers,\ncobblers, lawyers, and people to do\nadministrative and accounting works.\nIn recent times, certain new services\nbased on information technology such\nas internet cafe, ATM booths, call\ncentres, software companies etc have\nbecome important.\nTertiar y\n(Service)\nSectorPrimary\n(Agriculture )\nSector\nSecondary\n(Industrial)\nSectorproduces\nnatural\ngoods\nproduces\nmanufactured\ngoodshelps to develop\nother sectors\nWe begin by looking at different\nkind of economic activities.\n2024-25"

Also, the three sectors have a large number of\npeople working in them to produce these goods and services.\nThe next step, therefore, is to see how much goods and services\nare produced and how many people work in each sector . In\nan economy there could be one or more sectors which are\ndominant in terms of total production and employment, while\nother sectors are relatively small in size.\nHow do we count the various goods and\nservices and know the total production in\neach sector?\nWith so many thousands of goods and services produced,\nyou might think this is an impossible task! Not only would\nthe task be enormous, you might also wonder how we can\nadd up cars and computers and nails and furniture. It won’t\nmake sense!!!\nYou ar e right in thinking so. T o get ar ound this pr oblem,\neconomists suggest that the values of goods and services\nshould be used rather than adding up the actual numbers.\nFor example, if 10,000 kgs of wheat is sold at Rs 20 per kg,\nthe value of wheat will be Rs 2,00,000. The value of 5000\ncoconuts at Rs 15 per coconut will be Rs 75,000. Similarly,\nthe value of goods and services in the three sectors are\ncalculated, and then added up.\nRemember , ther e is one pr ecaution one has to take. Not\nevery good (or service) that is produced and sold needs to be\ncounted. It makes sense only to include the final goods and\nservices . Take, for instance, a farmer who sells wheat to a\nflour mill for Rs 20 per kg. The mill grinds the wheat and sells\nthe flour to a biscuit company for Rs 25 per kg. The biscuit\ncompany uses the flour and things such as sugar and oil to\nmake four packets of biscuits. It sells biscuits in the market to\nthe consumers for Rs 80 (Rs 20 per packet). Biscuits are the\nfinal goods, i.e., goods that reach the consumers.\nWhy are only ‘final goods and services’ counted?  In\ncontrast to final goods, goods such as wheat and the wheat\nflour in this example are intermediate goods.  Intermediate\ngoods are used up in producing final goods and services.\nThe value of final goods already includes  the value of all\nthe intermediate goods that are used in making the final\ngood. Hence, the value of Rs 80 for the biscuits (final good)\nalready includes the value of flour (Rs 25). Similarly, the\nvalue of all other intermediate goods would have been\nincluded. To count the value of the flour and wheatCOMP ARING THE THREE SECTORS\n...BUT I SHOULD BE P AID THE\nFULL V ALUE OF THE WHEA T\nTHAT I PR ODUCE !\n2024-25"

First as wheat, then as flour\nand finally as biscuits.\nThe value of final goods and\nservices produced in each sector\nduring a particular year  provides\nthe total production of the sector\nfor that year . And the sum of\nproduction in the three sectors gives\nwhat is called the Gross Domestic\nProduct (GDP) of a country.  It is the\nvalue of all final goods and services\nproduced within a country  during a\nparticular year . GDP shows how big\nthe economy is.\nIn India, the mammoth task of\nmeasuring GDP is undertaken by a\ncentral government ministry. This\nMinistry, with the help of various\ngovernment departments of all the\nIndian states and union territories,\ncollects information relating to total\nvolume of goods and services and their\nprices and then estimates the GDP .\nHistorical Change in Sectors\nGenerally, it has been noted from the\nhistories of many, now developed,\ncountries that at initial stages of\ndevelopment, primary sector was the\nmost important sector of economic\nactivity.\nAs the methods of farming\nchanged and agriculture sector began\nto pr osper , it pr oduced much mor e\nfood than before. Many people could\nnow take up other activities. There\nwere increasing number of craft-\npersons and traders. Buying and\nselling activities increased many times.\nBesides, there were also transporters,\nadministrators, ar my etc. However , at\nthis stage, most of the goods produced\nwere natural products from the\nprimary sector and most people were\nalso employed in this sector .Over a long time (more than\nhundred years), and especially\nbecause new methods of\nmanufacturing were introduced,\nfactories came up and started\nexpanding.

Greater the\ndevelopment of the primary and\nsecondary sectors, more would be the\ndemand for such services.\nThird, as income levels rise, certain\nsections of people start demanding\nmany more services like eating out,\ntourism, shopping, private hospitals,\nprivate schools, professional training\netc. You can see this change quite\nsharply in cities, especially in big cities.\nFourth, over the past decade or so,\ncertain new services such as\nthose based on information and\ncommunication technology have\nbecome important and essential. The\nproduction of these services has been\nrising rapidly.  In Chapter 4, we shall\nsee examples of these new services\nand the reasons for their expansion.\nHowever, you must remember that\nnot all of the service sector is growing\nequally well. Service sector in India\nemploys many different kinds of\npeople. At one end there are a limited\nnumber of services that employ highly\nskilled and educated workers. At the\nother end, there are a very large\nnumber of workers engaged in\nservices such as small shopkeepers,\nrepair persons, transport persons,\netc. These people barely manage to\nearn a living and yet they perform\nthese services because no alternative\nopportunities for work are available\nto them. Hence, only a part of this\nsector is growing in importance. You\nshall read more about this in the next\nsection.\nWhere are most of the people\nemployed?\nGraph 2 presents percentage share of\nthe three sectors in GDP.

The\nsame applies to the tertiary sector\nas well. While production in the\nservice sector rose by 1 4 times,\nemployment in the service sector\nrose around five times.\nAs a result, more than half of the\nworkers in the country are working\nin the primary sector, mainly in\nagriculture, producing only about\none sixth of the GDP. In contrast to\nthis, the secondary and tertiary\nsectors produce the rest of the\nproduce whereas they employ less\nabout half the people. Does this mean\nthat the workers in agriculture\nare not producing as much as\nthey could?\nWhat it means is that there\nare more people in agriculture than\nis necessary. So, even if you move\na few people out, production will\nnot be affected. In other words,\nworkers in the agricultural sector are\nunderemployed .\nFor instance, take the case of a\nsmall farmer, Laxmi, owning about\ntwo hectares of unirrigated land\ndependent only on rain and\ngrowing crops , like jowar  and arhar .\nAll five members of her family work\nin the plot throughout the year.\nWhy? They have nowhere else to go\nfor work. You will see that everyone\nis working, none remains idle, but\nin actual fact ,\n their labour effort\ngets divided. Each one is doing\nsome work but no one is fully\nemployed. This is the situation of\nunderemployment, where people\nare apparently working but all\nof them are made to work less\nthan their potential. This kind ofunderemployment is hidden in\ncontrast to someone who does not\nhave a job and is clearly visible as\nunemployed. Hence, it is also\ncalled disguised unemployment.\nNow, supposing a landlord,\nSukhram, comes and hires one or\ntwo members of the family to work\non his land. Laxmi’s family is now\nable to earn some extra income\nthrough wages. Since you do  not\nneed five people to look after that\nsmall plot, two people moving out\ndoes not affect production on their\nfarm. In the above example, two\npeople may move to work in a\nfactory. Once again the earnings of\nthe family would increase and they\nwould also continue to produce as\nmuch from their land.\nThere are lakhs of farmers like\nLaxmi  in India. This means that even\nif we remove a lot of people from\nagricultural sector and provide them\nwith proper work elsewhere,\nagricultural production will not\nsuffer. The incomes of the people who\ntake up other work would increase\nthe total family income.\nThis underemployment can also\nhappen in other sectors. For\nexample there are thousands of\ncasual workers in the service\nsector in urban areas who search\nfor daily employment. They are\nemployed as painters, plumbers,\nrepair persons and others doing\nodd jobs. Many of them don’t find\nwork everyday. Similarly , we see\nother people of the service sector\non the street pushing a cart or\nselling something where they may\nspend the whole day but earn\nvery little.  They are doing this\nwork because they do not have\nbetter opportunities.\n2024-25"

In what ways can one\nincrease employment for people?

Now\nsuppose a new dam is constructed\nand canals are dug to irrigate many\nsuch farms. This could lead to a lot of\nemployment generation within the\nagricultural sector itself reducing the\nproblem of underemployment.\nNow, suppose Laxmi and other\nfarmers produce much more than\nbefore. They would also need to sell some\nof this. For this they may be required to\ntransport their products to a nearby\ntown. If the government invests some\nmoney in transportation and storage of\ncrops, or makes better rural roads so\nthat mini-trucks reach everywhere\nseveral farmers like Laxmi, who now\nhave access to water, can continue to\ngrow and sell these crops. This activity\ncan provide productive employment to\nnot just farmers but also others such as\nthose in services like transport or trade.\nLaxmi’s need is not confined to\nwater alone. To cultivate the land, she\nalso needs seeds, fertilisers,\nagricultural equipment and pumpsets\nto draw water . Being a poor far mer,\nshe cannot afford many of these. So ,\nshe will have to borrow money from\nmoneylenders and pay a high rate ofinterest. If the local bank gives her\ncredit at a reasonable rate of interest,\nshe will be able to buy all these in time\nand cultivate her land. This means that\nalong with water , we also need to\nprovide cheap agricultural credit to the\nfarmers for far ming to impr ove. W e will\nlook at some of these needs in Chapter\n3, Money and Credit .\nAnother way by which we can\ntackle this problem is to identify,\npromote and locate industries and\nservices in semi-rural areas where a\nlarge number of people may be\nemployed. For instance, suppose\nmany farmers decide to grow arhar\nand chickpea (pulse crops). Setting\nup a dal mill to procure and process\nthese and sell in the cities is one such\nexample. Opening a cold storage could\ngive an opportunity for farmers to\nstore their products like potatoes and\nonions and sell them when the price\nis good. In villages near forest areas,\nwe can start honey collection centres\nwhere farmers can come and sell wild\nhoney. It is also possible to set up\nindustries that process vegetables and\nagricultural produce like potato,\nsweet potato, rice, wheat, tomato,\nfruits, which can be sold in outside\nmarkets. This will provide\nemployment in industries located in\nsemi-rural areas and not necessarily\nin large urban centres.\nDo you know that in India about\n60 per cent of the population belongs\nto the age group 5-29 years?

But the\nemployment opportunities in the\norganised sector have been expanding\nvery slowly. It is also common to find\nmany organised sector enterprises in\nthe unorganised sector . They adopt\nsuch strategies to evade taxes and\nrefuse to follow laws that protect\nlabourers. As a result, a large number\nof workers are forced to enter the\nunorganised sector jobs, which pay a\nvery low salary. They are often\nexploited and not paid a fair wage.\nTheir earnings are low and not\nregular . These jobs ar e not secur e and\nhave no other benefits.\nSince the 1990s, it is also common\nto see a large number of workers\nlosing their jobs in the organised\nsector . These workers ar e forced to\ntake up jobs in the unorganised\nsector with low earnings. Hence,\nbesides the need for more work, there\nis also a need for protection and\nsupport of the workers in the\nunorganised sector .Who are these vulnerable people\nwho need protection? In the rural\nareas, the unorganised sector mostly\ncomprises of landless agricultural\nlabourers, small and marginal\nfarmers, sharecroppers and artisans\n(such as weavers, blacksmiths,\ncarpenters and goldsmiths). Nearly\n80 per cent of rural households in\nIndia are in small and marginal\nfarmer category. These farmers need\nto be supported through adequate\nfacility for timely delivery of seeds,\nagricultural inputs, credit, storage\nfacilities and marketing outlets.\nIn the urban areas, unorganised\nsector comprises mainly of workers in\nsmall-scale industry, casual workers\nin construction, trade and transport\netc., and those who work as street\nvendors, head load workers, garment\nmakers, rag pickers etc. Small-scale\nindustry also needs government’s\nsupport for procuring raw material\nand marketing of output. The casual\nworkers in both rural and urban\nareas need to be protected.\nWe also find that majority of\nworkers from scheduled castes, tribes\nand backward communities\nfind themselves in the\nunorganised sector . Besides\ngetting the irregular and low\npaid work, these workers also\nface social discrimination.\nProtection and support to\nthe unorganised sector\nworkers is thus necessary\nfor both economic and\nsocial development.\nWhen factories close down, many\nonce regular workers are found\nselling goods or pushing a cart or\ndoing some other odd job\n2024-25"

The criterion for\nclassification could be many depending on what we desire to find out.\nThe process of classification helps to analyse a situation.\nIn dividing the economic activities into three sectors — primary,\nsecondary, tertiary — the criterion used was the ‘nature of activity’. On\nthe basis of this classification, we were able to analyse the pattern of total\nproduction and employment in India. Similarly, we divided the economic\nactivities into organised and unorganised and used the classification to\nlook at employment in the two sectors.\nWhat was the most important conclusion that was derived from the\nclassification exercises? What were the problems and solutions that were\nindicated? Can you summarise the information in the following table?\nTABLE 2.4 CLASSIFYING ECONOMIC ACTIVITIES\nAnother way of classifying economic\nactivities into sectors could be on the\nbasis of who owns assets and is\nresponsible for the delivery of services.\nIn the public  sector , the gover nment\nowns most of the assets and provides\nall the services. In the private  sector ,\nownership of assets and delivery of\nservices is in the hands of private\nindividuals or companies. Railways or\npost office is an example of the public\nsector whereas companies like Tata\nIron and Steel Company Limited\n(TISCO) or Reliance Industries\nLimited (RIL) are privately owned.\nActivities in the private sector are\nguided by the motive to earn profits.To get such services we have to pay\nmoney to these individuals and\ncompanies. The purpose of the public\nsector is not just to earn profits.\nGovernments raise money through\ntaxes and other ways to meet expenses\non the services rendered by it. Modern\nday governments spend on a whole\nrange of activities. What are these\nactivities? Why do governments spend\non such activities? Let’s find out.\nThere are several things needed by\nthe society as a whole but which the\nprivate sector  will not provide at\na reasonable cost.  Why?

Also, collecting\nmoney from thousands of people who\nuse these facilities is not easy. Even if\nthey do provide these things they\nwould charge a high rate for their\nuse. Examples are construction of\nroads, bridges, railways, harbours,\ngenerating electricity, providing\nirrigation through dams etc.  Thus,\ngovernments have to undertake such\nheavy  spending and ensure that\nthese facilities are available for\neveryone.\nThere are some activities, which\nthe government has to support . The\nprivate sector may not continue their\nproduction or business unless\ngovernment encourages it. For\nexample, selling electricity at the cost\nof generation may push up the costs\nof production of goods in many\nindustries. Many units, especially\nsmall-scale units, might have to shut\ndown. Government here steps in by\nproducing and supplying electricity\nat rates which these industries can\nafford. Government has to bear part\nof the cost.\nSimilarly, the Government in India\nbuys wheat and rice from farmers at\na ‘fair price’. This it stores in its\ngodowns and sells at a lower price to\nconsumers thr ough ration shops. Y ou\nhave read about this in the chapter\non Food Security in Class IX. Thegovernment has to bear some of the\ncost. In this way, the government\nsupports both farmers and\nconsumers.\nThere are a large number of\nactivities which are the primary\nresponsibility of the government. The\ngovernment must spend on these.\nProviding health and education\nfacilities for all is one example. We have\ndiscussed some of these issues in the\nfirst chapter. Running proper schools\nand providing quality education,\nparticularly elementary education, is\nthe duty of the government. India’s size\nof illiterate population is one of the\nlargest in the world.\nSimilarly, we know that nearly half\nof India’s children are malnourished\nand a quarter of them are critically ill.\nWe have read about Infant Mortality\nRates. The infant mortality rate of\nOdisha (40) or Madhya Pradesh (48)\nis higher than some of the poorest\nregions of the world. Government\nalso needs to pay attention to aspects\nof human development such as\navailability of safe drinking water,\nhousing facilities for the poor and food\nand nutrition.  It is also the duty of\nthe government to take care of the\npoorest and most ignored regions of\nthe country through increased\nspending in such areas.\nSUMMING UP\nIn this chapter we have looked at ways of\nclassifying economic activities into some\nmeaningful groups. One way of doing this\nis to examine whether the activity relates to\nthe primary, secondary or tertiary sectors.\nThe data for India, for the last thirty years,\nshows that while  goods and services\nproduced in the tertiary sector contribute\nthe most to GDP, the employment remains\nin the primary sector. We have also seenwhat all can be done for increasing\nemployment opportunities in the country.\nAnother classification is to consider whether\npeople are working in organised or\nunorganised sectors. Most people are\nworking in the unorganised sectors and\nprotection is necessary for them. We also\nlooked at the difference between private and\npublic activities, and why it is important for\npublic activities to focus on certain areas .\n2024-25"

                "text": "NOTES FOR THE  TEACHER\nCHAPTER 3 : MONEY AND CREDIT\nMoney is a fascinating subject and full of\ncuriosities. It is important to capture this\nelement for the students. The history of\nmoney and how various forms were used at\ndifferent times is an interesting story. At this\nstage the purpose is to allow students to\nrealise the social situation in which these\nforms were used. Modern forms of money are\nlinked to the banking system. This is the\ncentral idea of the first part of the chapter.\nThe present situation in India, where\nnewer forms of money are slowly spreading\nwith computerisation of the banking system,\noffers many opportunities to students to\nexplore on their own. We need not get into a\nformal discussion of the ‘functions of money’\nbut let it come up as questions. There are\ncertain areas that are not covered, such as\n‘creation of money’ (money multiplier) or the\nbacking of the modern system that may be\ndiscussed if you desire.\nAs you would see in the chapter, the stock\nof money consists of currency held by the\npublic and the demand deposits that they hold\nwith the banks. This is the money that people\ncan use as they wish and the government has\nto ensure that the system works smoothy.\nWhat would happen when the government\ndeclares that some of the currency notes used\nby people would be made invalid and would be\nreplaced by new currency? In India, during\nNovember 2016, currency notes in the\ndenomination of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 were\ndeclared invalid. People were asked to\nsurrender these notes to the bank by a specific\nperiod and receive new Rs. 500, Rs. 2,000 or\nother currency notes. This is known as\n‘demonetisation’. Since then, people were also\nencouraged to use their bank deposits rather\nthan cash for transactions. Hence, digital\ntransactions started by using bank-to-bank\ntransfer through the internet or mobile\nphones, cheques, ATM cards, credit cards,\nand Point of Sale (POS) swipe machines at\nshops. This is promoted to reduce the\nrequirement of cash for transactions and also\ncontrol corruption. Students could be asked\nto debate on the process and the impact of\ndemonetisation. They can be guided to makea collage of the major areas where people use\ndigital and cash transactions which are\nlegitimate and legal. They can also discuss the\ntransactions which are legal and why. It is also\nimportant to intimate students that different\ntypes of plastic cards are used in place of cash\ntransactions but not all of them money per se .\nCredit is a crucial element in economic\nlife and it is, therefore, important to first\nunderstand this in a conceptual manner.\nWhat are the aspects that one looks at in\nany credit arrangement and how this affects\npeople is the main focus of the second part\nof the chapter. The world around us offers a\ntremendous variety of such arrangements\nand it would be ideal to explain these\naspects of credit from situations that are\nfamiliar to your students. The other crucial\nissue of credit is its availability to all,\nespecially the poor, and on reasonable\nterms. We need to emphasise that this is a\nright of the people and without which a large\nsection of them would be kept out of the\ndevelopment process. There are many\ninnovative interventions, such as that of\nGrameen Bank, of which students may be\nmade familiar with but it is important to\nrealise that we don’t have answers to all\nquestions. We need to find new ways and\nthis is one of the social challenges that\ndeveloping countries face.\nSources for Information\nThe data on formal and informal sector credit\nused in this chapter is drawn from the\nsurvey on rural debt by the National Sample\nSurvey Organisation (All India Debt and\nInvestment Survey, 70th Round 2013,\nconducted by NSSO) now known as National\nStatistical Office (NSO) . The information and\ndata on Grameen Bank is taken from\nnewspaper reports and websites. In order\nto get the details of bank-related statistics\nor a particular detail of a bank, you can log\non to the websites of the Reserve Bank of\nIndia (www.rbi.org)  and the concerned\nbanks. Data on self-help groups is provided\non the website of the National Bank for\nAgriculture and Rural Development\n(NABARD) (www.nabard.org).\n38 3838 3838 U UUUUNDERST NDERSTNDERST NDERSTNDERST ANDINGANDINGANDING ANDINGANDING  E  E E  E ECONOMICCONOMICCONOMICCONOMICCONOMIC  D  D D  D DEVEL EVELEVEL EVELEVEL OPMENT OPMENTOPMENT OPMENTOPMENT\n2024-25"

Look around\nyou and you would easily be able to\nidentify several transactions involving\nmoney in any single day. Can you\nmake a list of these? In many of these\ntransactions, goods are being bought\nand sold with the use of money. In\nsome of these transactions, services\nare being exchanged with money.  For\nsome, there might not be any actual\ntransfer of money taking place now\nbut a pr omise to pay money later .\nHave you ever wondered why\ntransactions are made in\nmoney? The reason is simple.\nA person holding money can easily\nexchange it for any commodity or\nservice that he or she might want.\nThus everyone  prefers to receive\npayments in money and then\nexchange the money for things that\nthey want.  Take the case of a shoe\nmanufactur er. He wants to sell shoes\nin the market and buy wheat.  The\nshoe manufacturer will first exchange\nshoes that he has produced for\nmoney, and then exchange the money\nfor wheat. Imagine how much moredifficult it would be if the shoe\nmanufacturer had to directly\nexchange shoes for wheat without the\nuse of money. He would have to look\nfor a wheat growing farmer who not\nonly wants to sell wheat\nbut also wants to buy the\nshoes in exchange.\nThat is, both parties\nhave to agree to\nsell and buy each\nothers commodities.\nThis is known as\ndouble coincidence\nof wants.  What a person\ndesires to sell is exactly what the\nother wishes to buy. In a barter\nsystem where goods are directly\nexchanged without the use of money,\ndouble coincidence of wants is an\nessential feature.\nIn contrast, in an economy where\nmoney is in use, money by providing\nthe crucial intermediate step\neliminates the need for double\ncoincidence of wants. It is no longer\nnecessary for the shoe manufacturer\nto look for a farmer who will buy his\nshoes and at the same time sell himMONEY MONEYMONEYMONEYMONEY\nANDANDAND\nANDAND\nCREDIT CREDITCREDIT CREDITCREDITCHAPTER 3\nMONEY AS A MEDIUM OF EX CHANGE\nI’LL GIVE\nYOU SHOES\nFOR YOUR\nWHEA T.I DON’T NEED\nSHOES.

Before\nthe introduction of coins, a variety of\nobjects was used as money. For\nexample, since the very early ages,\nIndians used  grains and cattle as\nmoney. Thereafter came the use of\nmetallic coins — gold, silver , copper\ncoins — a phase which continued well\ninto the last century.\nCurrency\nModern forms of money include\ncurrency — paper notes and coins.\nUnlike the things that were used as\nmoney earlier , moder n curr ency is not\nmade of precious metal such as gold,\nsilver and copper .  And unlike grain\nand cattle, they are neither of\neveryday use. The modern currency\nis without any use of its own.\nThen, why is it accepted as a\nmedium of exchange?  It is accepted\nas a medium of exchange because the\ncurrency is authorised by the\ngovernment of the country.\nIn India, the Reserve Bank of India\nissues currency notes on behalf of the\ncentral government. As per Indian\nlaw, no other individual ororganisation is allowed to issue\ncurrency. Mor eover , the law legalises\nthe use of rupee as a medium of\npayment that cannot be refused in\nsettling transactions in India. No\nindividual in India can legally refuse\na payment made in rupees. Hence,\nthe rupee is widely accepted as a\nmedium of exchange.\nDeposits with Banks\nThe other form in which people hold\nmoney is as deposits with banks. At\na point of time, people need only some\ncurrency  for their day-to-day needs.\nFor instance, workers who receive\ntheir salaries at the end of each month\nhave extra cash at the beginning of\nthe month. What do people do with\nthis extra cash? They deposit it with\nthe banks by opening a bank\naccount in their name. Banks accept\nthe deposits and also pay an amount\nas interest on the deposits. In this way\npeople’s money is safe with the\nbanks and it earns an amount as\ninterest.  People also have the\nprovision to withdraw the money as\nand when they require. Since the\ndeposits in the bank accounts can be\nwithdrawn on demand, these\ndeposits are called demand deposits.\n1. How does the use of money make it easier to exchange things?\n2. Can you think of some examples of goods / services being exchanged or wages being\npaid through barter?LET’S WORK THESE OUT\nMODERN FORMS OF  MONEY\nEarly punch-\nmarked coins\n(may be 2500\nyears old)\nGupta\ncoins\nGold\nMohar\nfrom\nAkbar’s\nreignwheat. All he has to do is find a buyer\nfor his shoes. Once he has exchanged\nhis shoes for money, he can purchase\nwheat or any other commodity in the\nmarket. Since money acts as an\nintermediate in the exchange process,\nit is called a medium of exchange.\nTughlaq\ncoin\nModern coin\n2024-25"

The leather supplier takes this cheque,\nand  deposits it in his own account in the bank. The money is transferred from one bank\naccount to another bank account in a couple of days. The transaction is complete without\nany payment of cash.\nThus we see that demand deposits\nshare the essential features of money.\nThe facility of cheques against demand\ndeposits makes it possible to directly\nsettle payments without the use of cash.\nSince demand deposits are accepted\nwidely as a means of payment, along\nwith currency , they constitute money\nin the modern economy.You must r emember the r ole that\nthe banks play here.

There is an interesting\nmechanism at work here. Banks keep\nonly a small proportion of their\ndeposits as cash with themselves.  For\nexample, banks in India these days\nhold about 15 per cent of their\ndeposits as cash. This is kept as\nprovision to pay the depositors who\nmight come to withdraw money from\nthe bank on any given day. Since, on\nany particular day, only some of its\nmany depositors come to withdraw\ncash, the bank is able to manage with\nthis cash.\nBanks use the major portion of the\ndeposits to extend loans.  There is ahuge demand for loans for various\neconomic activities. W e shall r ead mor e\nabout this in the following sections.\nBanks make use of the deposits to\nmeet the loan requirements of the\npeople.  In this way, banks mediate\nbetween those who have surplus\nfunds (the depositors) and those who\nare in need of these funds (the\nborrowers). Banks charge a higher\ninterest rate on loans than what they\noffer on deposits. The difference\nbetween what is charged from\nborrowers and what is paid to\ndepositors is their main source of\nincome.LOAN ACTIVITIES OF BANKS\nPeople make\ndeposits\nPeople make\nwithdrawals and\nget interestPeople take\nloans\nPeople repay\nloans with\ninterestDEPOSITORS BORROWERS1.

To meet these expenses, Salim\nobtains loans from two sources.

The credit helps him to meet the\nongoing expenses of production, complete production on time,\nand thereby increase his earnings. Credit therefore plays a\nvital and positive role in this situation.\nSwapna, a small far mer, grows gr oundnut on her thr ee\nacres of land. She takes a loan from the moneylender\nto meet the expenses of cultivation, hoping that her\nharvest would help repay the loan. Midway through\nthe season the crop is hit by pests and the crop\nfails. Though Swapna sprays  her crops with\nexpensive pesticides, it makes little difference. She\nis unable to repay the moneylender and the debt\ngrows over the year into a large amount. Next\nyear, Swapna takes a fr esh loan for cultivation.\nIt is a nor mal cr op this year .

At the beginning of the cropping\nseason, the trader supplies the farm inputs on\ncredit, which is  to be repaid when the crops\nare ready for harvest.\nBesides the inter est char ge on the loan, the\ntrader also makes the farmers promise to\nsell the crop to him.

There is no one to stop them\nfrom using unfair means to get their\nmoney back.\nCompared to the formal lenders,\nmost of the informal lenders charge a\nmuch higher interest on loans. Thus,\nthe cost to the borrower of informal\nloans is much higher .\nHigher cost of borrowing means a\nlarger part of the earnings of the\nborrowers is used to repay the loan.\nHence, borrowers have less income\nleft for themselves (as we saw for\nShyamal in Sonpur). In certain\ncases, the high interest rate for\nborrowing can mean that the amount\nto be repaid is greater than the\nincome of the borr ower. This could\nlead to increasing debt (as we saw for\nRama in Sonpur) and debt trap. Also,\npeople who might wish to start an\nenterprise by borrowing may not do\nso because of the high cost of\nborrowing.\nFor these reasons, banks and\ncooperative societies need to lend\nmore. This would lead to higher in-\ncomes and many  people could then\nborrow cheaply for a variety\nof needs.  They could grow crops,do business, set up small-scale indus-\ntries etc. They could set up new indus-\ntries or trade in goods. Cheap and\naffordable credit is crucial for the\ncountry’s development.\nFormal and Informal Credit:\nWho gets what?\nGraph 2 shows the importance of\nformal and informal sources of credit\nfor people in urban areas.  The people\nare divided into four groups, from poor\nto rich, as shown in the figur e. You can\nsee that 84 per cent of the loans taken\nby poor households in the urban areas\nare from informal sources. Compare\nthis with the rich urban households.\nWhat do you find? Only 17 per cent of\ntheir loans are from informal sources,\nwhile 83 per cent are from formal\nsources. A similar pattern is also found\nin rural areas. The rich households are\navailing cheap credit from formal\nlenders whereas the poor households\nhave to pay a large amount for\nborrowing.\nWhat does all this suggest? First,\nthe formal sector still meets only about\nhalf of the total credit needs of the\nrural people. The remaining credit\nneeds are met from informal sources.\nPoor Households    Well-off       Rich\nHouseholds with a few assets     Households       Households\nBLUE : Per cent of loans from the FORMAL sector\nORANGE: Per cent of loans from the INFORMAL sectorGraph 2 : Of all the loans taken by urban households, what\npercentage was formal and what percentage was informal?\n2024-25"

At present, it is the richer\nhouseholds who receive formal credit\nwhereas the poor have to depend on\nthe informal sources. It is important\nthat the formal credit is distributed\nmore equally so that the poor can\nbenefit from the cheaper loans.\nIn the previous section we have seen\nthat poor households are still\ndependent on informal sources of\ncredit. Why is it so? Banks are not\npresent everywhere in rural India.\nEven when they are present, getting a\nloan from a bank is much more\ndifficult than taking a loan from\ninformal sources. As we saw for\nMegha, bank loans require properdocuments and collateral. Absence of\ncollateral is one of the major reasons\nwhich prevents the poor from getting\nbank loans.

However , the\nmoneylenders charge very high rates\nof interest, keep no records of the\ntransactions and harass the poor\nborrowers.\nIn recent years, people have tried\nout some newer ways of providing\nloans to the poor . The idea is to\norganise rural poor , in particular\nwomen, into small Self Help Groups\n(SHGs) and pool (collect) their\nsavings. A typical SHG has 15-20\nmembers, usually belonging to one\nneighbourhood, who meet and save\nregularly. Saving per member varies\nfrom Rs 25 to Rs 100 or more,\ndepending on the ability of the people\nto save. Members can take small loans\nfrom the group itself to meet their\nneeds. The group charges interest on\nthese loans but this is still less than\nwhat the moneylender charges. After\na year or two, if the group is regular\nin savings, it becomes eligible for\navailing loan from the bank.\nLoan is sanctioned in the\nname of the group and is\nmeant to create self-\nemployment opportunities\nfor the members. For\ninstance, small loans are\nprovided to the members for\nreleasing mortgaged land,\nfor meeting working capital\nneeds (e.g. buying seeds,\nfertilisers, raw materials\nlike bamboo and cloth), for\nhousing materials, for\nacquiring assets like sewing\nmachine, handlooms, cattle,\netc.\nMost of the important\ndecisions regarding the\nsavings and loan activities\nare taken by the group\nmembers. The group\ndecides as regards the loansto be granted — the purpose, amount,\ninterest to be charged, repayment\nschedule etc.  Also, it is the group\nwhich is responsible for the repayment\nof the loan. Any case of non-\nrepayment of loan by any one\nmember is followed up seriously by\nother members in the group. Because\nof this feature, banks are willing to\nlend to the poor women when\norganised in SHGs, even though they\nhave no collateral as such.\nThus, the SHGs help borrowers\novercome the problem of lack of\ncollateral. They can get timely loans\nfor a variety of purposes and at a\nreasonable inter est rate. Mor eover ,\nSHGs are the building blocks of\norganisation of the rural poor . Not\nonly does it help women to become\nfinancially self-reliant, the regular\nmeetings of the group provide a\nplatform to discuss and act on a\nvariety of social issues such as health,\nnutrition, domestic violence, etc.\nA women’s self-help group\nmeeting in Gujarat\n2024-25"

While this interconnectedness\nacross countries has many dimensions —\ncultural, political, social and economic — this\nchapter looks at globalisation in a more limited\nsense. It defines globalisation as the integration\nbetween countries through foreign trade and\nforeign investments by multinational\ncorporations (MNCs). As you will notice, the more\ncomplex issues of portfolio investment have been\nleft out.\nIf we look at the past thirty years or so, we\nfind that MNCs have been a major force in the\nglobalisation process connecting distant regions\nof the world. Why are the MNCs spreading their\nproduction to other countries and what are the\nways in which they are doing so? The first part\nof the chapter discusses this. Rather than\nrelying on quantitative estimates, the rapid rise\nand influence of the MNCs has been shown\nthrough a variety of examples, mainly drawn\nfrom the Indian context. Note that the examples\nare an aid to explain a more general point. While\nteaching, the emphasis should be on the ideas\nand examples are to be used as illustrations.\nYou can also cr eatively use compr ehension\npassages like the one given after Section II to\ntest and reinforce new concepts.\nIntegration of production and integration of\nmarkets is a key idea behind understanding the\nprocess of globalisation and its impact. This has\nbeen dealt with at length in this chapter ,\nhighlighting the r ole of MNCs in the pr ocess.  Y ou\nhave to ensure that the students grasp this idea\nwith sufficient clarity, before moving on to the\nnext topic.\nGlobalisation has been facilitated by several\nfactors. Three of these have been highlighted:\nrapid improvements in technology, liberalisationof trade and investment policies and, pressures\nfrom international organisations such as the\nWTO. Improvement in technology is a fascinating\narea for students  and you may, with a few\ndirections, encourage them to do their own\nexplorations. While discussing liberalisation, you\nhave to keep in mind that the students are\nunaware of what India was like in the\npre-liberalisation era. A role-play could be\nconceived to compare and contrast the pre and\npost-liberalisation era. Similarly, international\nnegotiations under WTO and the uneven\nbalances in power are interesting subjects that\ncan be covered in a discussion mode rather than\nas lectures.\nThe final section covers the impact of\nglobalisation . To what extent has globalisation\ncontributed to the development process? This\nsection draws on the topics covered in Chapters\n1 and 2 (for example, what is a fair development\ngoal), which you can refer to. Also, examples and\nactivities drawn from the local environment are\na must while discussing this section. This might\ninclude contexts that have not been covered in\nthe chapter , such as the impact of imports on\nlocal farmers, etc. Collective brainstorming\nsessions can be conducted to analyse such\nsituations.\nSources for Information\nThe call for a fairer globalisation has been given,\namong others, by the International Labour\nOrganisation — www.ilo.org.  Another interesting\nresource is the WTO website http://www.wto.org.\nIt gives access to the variety of agreements that\nare being negotiated at the WTO.  For company\nrelated information, most MNCs have their own\nwebsites.

In the above example, China\nprovides the advantage of being a\ncheap manufacturing location.\nMexico and Eastern Europe are usefulfor their closeness to the markets\nin the US and Europe.

The\nbenefit to the local company of such\njoint production is two-fold. First,\nMNCs can provide money for\nadditional investments, like buying\nnew machines for faster production.\nSecond, MNCs might bring with them\nthe latest technology for production.In general, MNCs set up production\nwhere it is close to the markets; where\nthere is skilled and unskilled labour\navailable at low costs; and where the\navailability of other factors of\nproduction is assured. In addition,\nMNCs might look for government\npolicies that look after their interests.\nYou will r ead mor e about the policies\nlater in the chapter .\nHaving assured themselves of these\nconditions, MNCs set up factories and\noffices for production. The money that\nis spent to buy assets such as land,\nbuilding, machines and other\nequipment is called investment.\nInvestment made by MNCs is called\nforeign investment .

MNCs with huge wealth\ncan quite easily do so. To take an\nexample, Cargill Foods, a very large\nAmerican MNC, has bought over\nsmaller Indian companies such as\nParakh Foods. Parakh Foods had\nbuilt a large marketing network in\nvarious parts of India, where its brand\nwas well-reputed. Also, Parakh Foods\nhad four oil refineries, whose control\nhas now shifted to Cargill. Cargill is\nnow the largest producer of edible oil\nin India, with a capacity to make 5\nmillion pouches daily!\nIn fact, many of the top MNCs\nhave wealth exceeding the entire\nbudgets of the developing country\ngovernments . With such enormous\nwealth, imagine the power and\ninfluence of these MNCs!\nThere’s another way in which\nMNCs control production. Large\nMNCs in developed countries place\norders for production with small\nproducers. Gar ments, footwear ,\nsports items are examples of\nindustries where production is\ncarried out by a large number of\nsmall producers around the world.\nThe products are supplied to the\nMNCs, which then sell these under\ntheir own brand names to the\ncustomers. These large MNCs have\ntremendous power to determine price,\nquality, delivery, and labour\nconditions for these distant\nproducers.\nThus, we see that there are a\nvariety of ways in which the MNCs are\nspreading their production and\ninteracting with local producers in\nvarious countries across the globe. By\nsetting up partnerships with local\ncompanies, by using the local\ncompanies for supplies, by closely\ncompeting with the local companies\nor buying them up, MNCs are exerting\na strong influence on production\nat these distant locations. As a\nresult , production in these widely\ndispersed locations is getting\ninterlinked.Women at home in Ludhiana making footballs for lar ge MNCs\nJeans produced in developing countries being\nsold in USA for Rs 6500 ($145)\n2024-25"

Can you guess why?\nFor a long time foreign trade has been\nthe main channel connecting\ncountries. In history you would have\nread about the trade routes\nconnecting India and South Asia to\nmarkets both in the East and W est\nand the extensive trade that took place\nalong these routes. Also, you would\nremember that it was trading interests\nwhich attracted various trading\ncompanies such as the East India\nCompany to India. What then is the\nbasic function of foreign trade?To p ut it simply, foreign trade\ncreates an opportunity for the\nproducers to reach beyond the\ndomestic markets, i.e., markets of their\nown countries. Producers can sell their\nproduce not only in markets located\nwithin the country but can also\ncompete in markets located in other\ncountries of the world. Similarly, for the\nbuyers, import of goods produced in\nanother country is one way of\nexpanding the choice of goods beyond\nwhat is domestically produced.FOREIGN TR ADE AND INTEGR ATION OF\nMARKETSFord Motors, an American\ncompany, is one of the\nworld’s largest\nautomobile  manufacturers\nwith production spread\nover 26 countries of the\nworld. Ford Motors came\nto India in 1995 and\nspent Rs. 1700 crore to\nset up a large plant near\nChennai. This was done\nin collaboration with\nMahindra and Mahindra,\na major Indian\nmanufacturer of jeeps\nand trucks. By the year\n2017, Ford Motors was\nselling 88,000 cars in the\nIndian markets,\nwhile another 1,81,000\ncars were exported from\nIndia to South Africa,\nMexico, Brazil and United\nStates of America.

Suppose the\nIndian government puts a tax on\nimport of toys. What would happen?\nThose who wish to import these toys\nwould have to pay tax on this. Because\nof the tax, buyers will have to pay a\nhigher price on imported toys. Chinese\ntoys will no longer be as cheap  in the\nIndian markets and imports from\nChina will automatically reduce.\nIndian toy-makers will pr osper .\nTax on imports is an example of\ntrade barrier . It is called a barrier\nbecause some restriction has been set\nup. Governments can use trade\nbarriers to increase or decrease\n(regulate) foreign trade and to decide\nwhat kinds of goods and how much\nof each, should come into the country.\nThe Indian government, after\nIndependence, had put barriers to\nforeign trade and foreign investment.\nThis was considered necessary to\nprotect the producers within the\ncountry  from foreign competition.\nIndustries were just coming up in the\n1950s and 1960s, and competition\nfrom imports at that stage would not\nhave allowed these industries to come\nup. Thus, India allowed imports\nof only essential items such asmachinery, fertilisers, petroleum\netc. Note that all developed\ncountries, during the early stages of\ndevelopment, have given protection to\ndomestic producers through a variety\nof means.\nStarting ar ound 1991, some far -\nreaching changes in policy were made\nin India.  The government decided that\nthe time had come for Indian\nproducers to compete with producers\naround the globe. It felt that\ncompetition would improve the\nperformance of producers within the\ncountry since they would have to\nimprove their quality. This decision\nwas supported by powerful\ninternational organisations.\nThus, barriers on foreign trade and\nforeign investment were removed to a\nlarge extent. This meant that goods\ncould be imported and exported\neasily and also foreign companies\ncould set up factories and offices\nhere.\nRemoving barriers or restrictions\nset by the government is what is\nknown as liberalisation.  With\nliberalisation of trade, businesses are\nallowed to make decisions freely\nabout what they wish to import or\nexport. The government imposes\nmuch less restrictions than before\nand is therefore said to be more\nliberal.\n1.What do you understand by liberalisation of foreign trade?\n2.Tax on import s is one type of trade barrier . The government could also place a limit on\nthe number of goods that can be imported. This is known as quotas.  Can you explain,\nusing the example of Chinese toys, how quotas can be used as trade barriers?\nDo you think this should be used? Discuss.LET’S WORK THESE OUT\n2024-25"

There are many\naspects of unequal situations in a market and\npoor enforcement of rules and regulations.\nHence, there is a need to sensitise learners and\nencourage them to participate in the consumer\nmovement. This chapter provides case histories\n— how some consumers were exploited  in real\nlife situation and how legal institutions helped\nconsumers  in getting compensated and in\nupholding their rights. The case histories would\nenable the students to link these narratives to\ntheir life experiences. W e have to enable\nstudents to understand that the awareness of\nbeing a well-informed consumer arose out of\nconsumer movement and active participation of\npeople through their struggles over a long\nperiod. This chapter also provides details of a\nfew organisations helping consumers in different\nways. Finally, it ends with some critical issues\nof the consumer movement in India.\nAspects of Teaching / Sources of\nInformation\nThis chapter has questions, case studies and\nactivities. It would be preferred that students\ndiscuss these in groups orally. Some of these\ncould be answered in writing individually.\nWhile carrying out each activity you could\nstart with a brainstorming session about the\nactivity.

Have a\ndiscussion with them about the purpose of the\nvisit, things they need to do beforehand and\nthings that need to be collected and the task\n(report/ project / article, etc.) they would carry\nout after the visit. As part of this chapter , the\nlearners may do letter -writing and speaking\nactivities. W e may have to be sensitive to the\nlanguage aspect of exercises.\nThis chapter contains material collected\nfrom authenticated websites, books, newspapers\nand magazines. For example, https://consumer\naffairs.nic.in  is a website of Central Government\nMinistry of Consumer Affairs, Food & Public\nDistribution. Another website www.cuts-\ninternational.org  is the website of a consumer\norganisation working in India for 40 years. It\npublishes a variety of material to create\nconsumer awareness in India. They need to be\nshared among learners so that they can also\ncollect material as part of their activities.

As\nproducers of goods and services we\ncould be working in any of the sectors\ndiscussed earlier such as agriculture,\nindustry, or services. Consumers\nparticipate in the market when they\npurchase goods and services that they\nneed. These are the final goods that\npeople as consumers use.\nIn the preceding chapters we\ndiscussed the need for rules and\nregulations or steps that would\npromote development. These could be\nfor the protection of workers in the\nunorganised sector or to protect\npeople from high interest rates\ncharged by moneylenders  in the\ninformal sector . Similarly, rules and\nregulations are also required for\nprotecting the environment.\nFor example, moneylenders in the\ninformal sector that you read about\nin Chapter 3 adopt various tricks to\nbind the borrower: they could make\nthe producer sell the produce to them\nat a low rate in return for a timely loan;\nthey could force a small farmer like\nSwapna to sell her land to pay back\nthe loan. Similarly, many people who\nwork in the unorganised sector have\nto work at a low wage and accept\nconditions that are not fair and are\nalso often harmful to their health. To\nprevent such exploitation, we\nhave talked of rules and regulations\nfor their protection. There are\norganisations that have struggled\nfor long to ensure that these rules are\nfollowed.THE CONSUMER IN THE MARKETPLACE\nLikewise, r ules and regulations are\nrequired for the protection of the\nconsumers in the marketplace.\nIndividual consumers often find\nthemselves in a weak position.\nWhenever there is a complaint\nregarding a good or service that had\nbeen bought, the seller tries to shift\nall the responsibility on to the buyer .\nTheir position usually is – “If you\ndidn’t like what you bought, please\ngo elsewhere”. As if the seller has no\nresponsibility once a sale is\ncompleted! The consumer movement,\nas we shall discuss later , is an ef fort\nto change this situation.\nExploitation in the marketplace\nhappens in various ways. For\nexample, sometimes traders indulge\nin unfair trade practices such as when\nshopkeepers weigh less than what\nthey should or when traders add\ncharges that were not mentioned\nbefore, or when adulterated/defective\ngoods are sold.\nMarkets do not work in a fair\nmanner when producers are few and\npowerful whereas consumers\npurchase in small amounts and are\nscattered. This happens especially\nwhen large companies are producing\nthese goods. These companies with\nhuge wealth, power and reach can\nmanipulate the market in various\nways. At times false information is\npassed on through the media, and\nother sources to attract consumers.\nFor example, a company for years\nsold powder milk for babies all over\nTHEY PURPOSEL Y MADE IT\nSO IT WOULD F ALL AP ART\nAFTER A FEW MONTHS SO\nTHAT I WILL BUY A NEW ONE!\n2024-25"

Similarly, a\nlong battle had to be fought with\ncourt cases to make cigarette-\nmanufacturing companies accept that\ntheir pr oduct could cause cancer .\nHence, there is a need for rules and\nregulations to ensure protection for\nconsumers.\nCONSUMER MO VEMENT\nquality of goods and services on the\nsellers.\nIn India, the consumer movement\nas a ‘social force’ originated with the\nnecessity of protecting and promoting\nthe interests of consumers against\nunethical and unfair trade practices.\nRampant food shortages, hoarding,\nblack marketing, adulteration of food\nand edible oil gave birth to the\nconsumer movement in an organised\nform in the 1960s. T ill the 1970s,\nconsumer organisations were largely\nengaged in writing articles and\nholding exhibitions. They formed\nconsumer groups to look into the\nmalpractices in ration shops and\novercrowding in the road passenger\ntransport. More recently, India\nwitnessed an upsurge in the number\nof consumer groups.The consumer movement arose out\nof dissatisfaction of the consumers\nas many unfair practices were being\nindulged in by the sellers. There was\nno legal system available to\nconsumers to protect them from\nexploitation in the marketplace. For\na long time, when a consumer was\nnot happy with a particular brand\nproduct or shop, he or she generally\navoided buying that brand product,\nor would stop purchasing from that\nshop. It was presumed that it was\nthe responsibility of consumers to be\ncareful while buying a commodity\nor service. It took many years for\norganisations in India, and around\nthe world, to create awareness\namongst people. This has also\nshifted the responsibility of ensuring\nEVERYONE KNOWS\nTOBACCO KILLS PEOPLE,\nBUT WHO CAN SA Y THA T\nTOBACCO COMP ANIES\nSHOULD NOT BE FREE\nTO SELL T OBACCO?\n2024-25"

Y ou also need\npublic or government action to see\nthat this quality is maintained.\nHowever , we do find bad quality\nproducts in the market because the\nsupervision of these rules is weak and\nthe consumer movement is also not\nstrong enough.\n1.For the following (you can add to the list) product s/services discuss what safety\nrules should be observed by the producer?\n(a) LPG cylinder (b) cinema theatre (c) circus (d) medicines (e) edible oil\n(f) marriage pandal (g) a high-rise building.\n2.Find out any case of accident or negligence from people around you, where you think\nthat the responsibility lay with the producer .

These details are about\ningredients used, price, batch\nnumber , date of manufactur e, expiry\ndate and the address of the\nmanufactur er. When we buy\nmedicines, on the packets, you might\nfind ‘directions for proper use’ and\ninformation relating to side effects and\nrisks associated with usage of that\nmedicine. When you buy garments,\nyou will find information on\n‘instructions for washing’.\nWhy is it that rules have been made\nso that the manufacturer displays this\ninformation? It is because consumers\nhave the right to be informed  about\nthe particulars of goods and services\nthat they purchase. Consumers\ncan then complain and ask for\ncompensation or replacement if the\nproduct proves to be defective in any\nmanner . For example, if we buy aproduct a nd find it defective well\nwithin the expiry period, we can ask\nfor a replacement. If the expiry period\nwas not printed, the manufacturer\nwould blame the shopkeeper and will\nnot accept the responsibility. If people\nsell medicines that have expired\nsevere action can be taken against\nthem. Similarly, one can protest and\ncomplain if someone sells a good at\nmore than the printed price on the\npacket. This is indicated by ‘MRP’ —\nmaximum retail price. In fact\nconsumers can bargain with the seller\nto sell at less than the MRP .\nIn recent times, the right to\ninformation has been expanded to\ncover various services provided by the\nGovernment. In October 2005, the\nGovernment of India enacted a law,\npopularly known as R TI (Right to\nInformation) Act, which ensures its\ncitizens all the information about the\nfunctions of government departments.\nThe ef fect of the R TI Act can be\nunderstood from th e following case.\nWaiting...Waiting...Waiting...Waiting...Waiting...\nAmritha, an engineering graduate\nafter submitting all the certificates\nand attending the interview for a\njob in a gover nment department, did\nnot receive any news of the result.\nThe officials also refused to comply\nwith her queries. She therefore filed\nan application using the R TI Act\nsaying that it was her right to know\nthe result in a reasonable time so\nthat she could plan her future.
