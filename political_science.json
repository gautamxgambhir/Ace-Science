We noted last year that in a democracy all power does not rest with any one organ of the government. An intelligent sharing of power among legislature, executive and judiciary is very important to the design of a democracy. In this and the next two chapters, we carry this idea of power-sharing forward. We start with two stories from Belgium and Sri Lanka. Both these stories are about how democracies handle demands for power-sharing. The stories yield some general conclusions about the need for power-sharing in democracy.  This allows us to discuss various forms of power-sharing that will be taken up in the following two chapters.\nChapter 1.indd   1 08-04-2022   12:29:05\n2024-25"

Why do we start by talking of this?\nEthnic :  A social \ndivision based on shared culture. People belonging to the same ethnic group believe in their common descent because of similarities of physical type or of culture or both. They need not always have the same religion or nationality.\nBelgium is a small country in Europe, \nsmaller in area than the state of Haryana. It has borders with France, the Netherlands, Germany and Luxembourg. It has a population of a little over one crore, about half the population of Haryana. The \nethnic  \ncomposition of this small country is very complex. Of the country’s total population, 59 per cent lives in the Flemish region and speaks Dutch language. Another 40 per cent people live in the Wallonia region and speak French. Remaining one per cent of the Belgians speak German. In the capital city Brussels, 80 per cent people speak French while 20 per cent are Dutch-speaking.\nThe minority French-speaking \ncommunity was relatively rich and powerful. This was resented by the Dutch-speaking community who got the benefit of economic development and education much later. This led to tensions between the Dutch-speaking and French-speaking communities during the 1950s and 1960s. The tension between the two communities was more acute in Brussels. Brussels presented a special problem: the Dutch-speaking people constituted a majority in the country, but a minority in the capital. \nLet us compare this to the \nsituation in another country. Sri Lanka is an island nation, just a few kilometres off the southern coast of Tamil Nadu. It has about two crore people, about the same as in Haryana. Like other nations in the South Asia region, Sri Lanka has a diverse population. The major social groups are the Sinhala-speakers (74 per cent) and the Tamil-speakers (18 per cent). Among Tamils there are two sub-groups. Tamil natives of the country are called ‘Sri Lankan \nCommunities \nand regions of \nBelgium\nWalloon (French-speaking)\nFlemish (Dutch-speaking)\nGerman-speakingBrussels-Capital Region\nLook at the maps of Belgium and Sri Lanka.

The rest, \nwhose fo\nrefathers came from India as \nplantation workers during colonial \nperiod, are called ‘Indian Tamils’. As you can see from the map,  Sri Lankan Tamils are concentrated in the north and east of the country. Most of the Sinhala-speaking people are Buddhists, while most of the Tamils are Hindus or Muslims. There are about 7 per cent Christians, who are both Tamil and Sinhala. \nJust imagine what could happen \nin situations like this. In Belgium, the Dutch community could take advantage of its numeric majority and force its will on the French and German-speaking population. This would push the conflict among communities further. This could  lead to a very messy partition of the country; both the sides would claim control over Brussels. In Sri Lanka, the Sinhala community enjoyed an even bigger majority and could impose its will on the entire country. Now, let us look at what happened in both these countries.\nMajoritarianism in Sri Lanka\nSri Lanka emerged as an independent country in 1948. The leaders of the Sinhala community sought to secure dominance over government by virtue of their majority. As a result, the democratically elected government adopted a series of \nmajoritarian  measures to establish \nSinhala supremacy.\nIn 1956, an Act was passed \nto recognise Sinhala as the only official language, thus disregarding Tamil. The governments followed preferential policies that favoured Sinhala applicants for university positions and government jobs. A new constitution stipulated that the state shall protect and foster Buddhism.\nAll these government measures, \ncoming one after the other, gradually increased the feeling of alienation among the Sri Lankan Tamils. They felt that none of the major political parties led by the Buddhist Sinhala leaders was sensitive to their language and culture. They felt that the constitution and government policies denied them equal political rights, discriminated against them in getting jobs and other opportunities and ignored their interests. As a \nMajoritarianism:  A \nbelief that the majority \ncommunity should be able to rule a country in whichever way it wants, by disregarding the wishes and needs of the minority. \nChapter 1.indd   3 08-04-2022   12:29:08\n2024-25"

I am glad our Constitution does not say which minister will come from which community.\nThe Belgian leaders took a different \npath. They recognised the existence of regional differences and cultural diversities. Between 1970 and 1993, they amended their constitution four times so as to work out an arrangement that would enable everyone to live together within the same country. The arrangement they worked out is different from any other country and is very innovative. Here are some of the elements of the Belgian model:\n\n  Constitution p\nrescribes that the \nnumber of Dutch and French-speaking \nministers shall be equal in the central \ngovernment. Some special laws require \nWhat’s wrong \nif the majority community rules?

The State Governments are not subordinate to the Central Government.\n\n  Brussels has a separate government \nin which \nboth the communities have \nequal representation.

But their demand for more autonomy to provinces populated by the Tamils was repeatedly denied. By 1980s, several political organisations were formed demanding an independent Tamil Eelam (state) in northern and eastern parts of Sri Lanka. \nThe distrust between the two \ncommunities turned into widespread \nconflict. It soon turned into a \ncivil \nwar. As a result thousands of people \nof both the communities have been killed. Many families were forced to leave the country as refugees and many more lost their livelihoods. The civil war has caused a terrible setback to the social, cultural and economic life of the country. It ended in 2009. \nThe photograph here is of a street \naddress in Belgium.

                "text": "Power-sharing5\nSo you are \nsaying that sharing of power makes us more powerful. Sounds odd! Let me think.\nWhat do we learn from these two \nstories of Belgium and Sri Lanka? Both are democracies. Yet, they dealt with the question of power sharing differently. In Belgium, the leaders have realised that the unity of the country is possible only by respecting the feelings and interests of different communities and regions. Such a realisation resulted in mutually acceptable arrangements for sharing power. Sri Lanka shows us a contrasting example. It shows us that if a majority community wants to force its dominance over others and refuses to share power, it can undermine the unity of the country. \nRead any newspaper for one week and make clippings of \nnews related to ongoing conflicts or wars. A group of five \nstudents could pool their clippings together and do the following:\n Classify these conflicts by their location (your state, India, \noutside India).\n Find out the cause of each of these conflicts. How many of these are related to power sharing disputes?\n Which of these conflicts could be resolved by working out power sharing arrangements?\nEuropean Parliament in Brussels, Belgiumaccepted equal representation in the \nCentral Government.\n Apart from the Central and  \nthe State \nGovernment, there is a  \nthird kind of government. This ‘community government’ is elected by people belonging to one language community – Dutch, French and German-speaking – no matter where they live. This government has the power regarding cultural, educational and language-related issues.\nYou might find the Belgian model \nvery complicated. It indeed is very complicated, even for people living in Belgium. But these arrangements have worked well so far. They helped to avoid civic strife between the two major communities and a possible division of the country on linguistic lines. When many countries of Europe came together to form the European Union, Brussels was chosen as its headquarters.\nChapter 1.indd   5 08-04-2022   12:29:11\n2024-25"

Many French-speaking students \nin her school want the medium of instruction to be French. Selvi studies in a school in the northern region of Sri Lanka. All the students in her school are Tamil-speaking and they want the medium of instruction to be Tamil. \n If the parents of Annette and Selvi were to approach respective governments to realise the desire of the child who is more lik\nely to succeed? And why? Why power sharing is desirable?\nThus, two different sets of reasons can \nbe given in favour of power sharing. Firstly, power sharing is good because it helps to reduce the possibility of conflict between social groups. Since social conflict often leads to violence and political instability, power sharing is a good way to ensure the stability of political order. Imposing the will of majority community over others may look like an attractive option in the short run, but in the long run it undermines the unity of the nation. Tyranny of the majority is not just oppressive for the minority; it often affects majority adversely as well. \nThere is a second, deeper reason \nwhy power sharing is good for democracies. Power sharing is the very spirit of democracy. A democratic rule involves sharing power with those affected by its exercise, and who have to live with its effects. People have a right to be consulted on how they are to be governed. A legitimate government is one where citizens, through participation, acquire a stake in the\n system. \nLet us call the \nfirst set of reasons \nprudential  and the second moral. \nWhile prudential reasons stress that power sharing will bring out better outcomes, moral reasons emphasise the very act of power sharing as\n valuable.\nPrudential:  Based on \nprudence, or on careful \ncalculation of gains and losses. Prudential decisions are usually contrasted with decisions based purely on moral considerations.\nThe cartoon at the left refers to the problems of running the Germany’s grand coalition government that includes the two major parties of the country, namely the Christian Democratic Union and the Social Democratic Party. The two parties are historically rivals to each other. They had to form a coalition government because neither of them got clear majority of seats on their own in the 2005 elections. They take divergent positions on several policy matters, but still jointly run the government.

As usual, Vetal \nstarted telling Vikram a story to keep him awake while \ndriving. This time the story went as follows:\n“In the city of Beirut, there lived a man called Khalil. His \nparents came from different communities.  His father was an Orthodox Christian and mother a Sunni Muslim. This was not so uncommon in this modern, cosmopolitan city. People from various communities that lived in Lebanon came to live in its capital, Beirut. They lived together, intermingled, yet fought a bitter civil war among themselves. One of Khalil’s uncles was killed in that war.\nAt the end of this civil war, Lebanon’s leaders came together and agreed to some basic \nrules for power sharing among different communities. As per these rules, the country’ s \nPresident must belong to the Maronite sect of Catholic Christians. The Prime Minister must be from the Sunni Muslim community. The post of Deputy Prime Minister is fixed for Orthodox Christian sect and that of the Speaker for Shi’a Muslims. Under this pact, the Christians agreed not to seek French protection and the Muslims agreed not to seek unification with the neighbouring state of Syria.When the Christians and Muslims came to this agreement, they were nearly equal in population. Both sides ha ve continued to \nrespect this agreement though now the Muslims are in clear majority. \nKhalil does not like this system one bit. He is a popular man with political ambition. \nBut under the present system, the top position is out of his reach. He does not practise either his father’s or his mother’s religion and does not wish to be known by either. He cannot understand why Lebanon can’t be like any other ‘normal’ democracy. “Just hold an election, allow everyone to contest and whoever wins maximum votes becomes the president, no matter which community he comes from. Why can’t we do that, like in other democracies of the world?” he asks. His elders, who have seen the bloodshed of the civil war, tell him that the present system is the best guarantee for peace…”\nThe story was not finished, but they had reached the TV tower \nwhere they stopped every day. Vetal wrapped up quickly and posed his customary question to Vikram: “If you had the power to rewrite the rules in Lebanon, what would you do? Would you adopt the ‘regular’ rules followed everywhere, as Khalil suggests? Or stick to the old rules? Or do something else?” Vetal did not forget to remind Vikram of their basic pact: “If you have an answer in mind and yet do not speak up, your mobike will freeze, and so will you!”\nCan you help poor Vikram in answering Vetal?

Let us look at some of the most common arrangements that we have or will come across.\n 1\n Power is shared among different \norgans \nof government, such as the \nlegislature, executive and judiciary. \nLet us call this horizontal distribution of power because it allows different organs of government placed at the same level to exercise different powers. Such a separation ensures that none of the organs can exercise unlimited power. Each organ checks the others. This results in a balance of power among various institutions. Last year, we studied that in a democracy, even though ministers and government officials exercise power, they are responsible to the Parliament or State Assemblies. Similarly, although judges are appointed by the executive, they can check the functioning of executive or laws made by the legislatures. This arrangement is called a system of checks and balances.\n 2\n Power can be shared amo\nng \ngovernments at different levels – \na general government for the entire country and governments at the provincial or regional level. Such a general government for the entire country is usually called federal government. In India, we refer to it as the Central or Union Government. The governments at the provincial or regional level are called by different names in different countries.  The idea of power-sharing has emerged in opposition to the notions of undivided political power. For a long time, it was believed that all power of a government must reside in one person or group of persons located at one place. It was felt that if the power to decide is dispersed, it would not be possible to take quick decisions and to enforce them. But these notions have changed with the emergence of democracy. One basic principle of democracy is that people are the source of all political power. In a democracy, people rule themselves through institutions of self-government. In a good democratic government, due respect is given to diverse groups and views that exist in a society. Everyone has a voice in the shaping of public policies. Therefore, it follows that in a democracy, political \nForms of power-sharing\nReigning the Reins  \nIn 2005, some new laws were made in Russia giving more powers to \nits president.

                "text": "Power-sharing9\nIn India, we call them State \nGovernments. This system is not followed in all countries. There are many countries where there are no provincial or state governments. But in those countries like ours, where there are different levels of government, the constitution clearly lays down the powers of different levels of government. This is what they did in Belgium, but was refused in Sri Lanka. This is called federal division of power. The same principle can be extended to levels of government lower than the State government, such as the municipality and panchayat. Let us call division of powers involving higher and lower levels of government vertical division of power. We shall study these at \nsome length in the next  chapter.\n 3 Power may also be shared \namong different social groups,  \nsuch as the religious and linguistic groups. ‘Community government’ in Belgium is a good example of this arrangement. In some countries, there are constitutional and legal arrangements, whereby socially weaker sections and women are represented in the legislatures and administration. Last year, we studied the system of ‘reserved constituencies’ in assemblies and the parliament of our country. This type of arrangement is meant to give space in the government and administration to diverse social \nIn my school, \nthe class monitor \nchanges every month.

In Unit II, we shall look at various ways of accommodating social diversities.\n4 Power sharing arrangements \ncan also be seen in the way political \nparties, pressure groups and movements control or influence \nthose in power. In a democracy, the citizens must have freedom to choose among various contenders for power. In contemporary democracies, this takes the form of competition among different parties. Such competition ensures that power does not remain in one hand. In the long run, power is shared among different political parties that represent different ideologies and social groups. Sometimes this kind of sharing can be direct, when two or more parties form an alliance to contest elections. If their alliance is elected, they form a coalition government and thus share power. In a democracy, we find interest groups, such as those of traders, businessmen, industrialists, farmers and industrial workers. They also will have a share in governmental power, either through participation in governmental committees or bringing influence on the decision-making process. In Unit III, we shall study the working of  \npolitical parties.\nChapter 1.indd   9 4/29/2022   5:00:31 PM\n2024-25"

You would recall that one of the key changes made in the Constitution of Belgium was to reduce the power of the Central Government and to give these powers to the regional governments. Regional governments existed in Belgium even earlier. They had their roles and powers. But all these powers were given to these governments and could be withdrawn by the Central Government. The change that took place in 1993 was that the regional governments were given constitutional powers that were no longer dependent on the central government. Thus, Belgium shifted from a unitary to a federal form of government. Sri Lanka continues to be, for all practical purposes, a \nunitary system where the national government has all the powers. Tamil leaders want Sri Lanka to become a federal system.\nFederalism is a system of \ngovernment in which the power is divided between a central authority and various constituent units of the country. Usually, a federation has two levels of government. One is the government for the entire country that is usually responsible for a few subjects of common national interest. The  others are governments at the level of provinces or states that look after much of the day-to-day administering of their state. Both these levels of governments enjoy their power independent of the other. \nChapter 2.indd   14 08-04-2022   12:30:50\n2024-25"

                "text": "Federalism15\n7 The federal system thus  has dual \nobjectives: to safeguard and promote \nunity of the country, while at the same time accommodate regional diversity. Therefore, two aspects are crucial for the institutions and practice of federalism. Governments at different levels should agree to some rules of power-sharing. They should also trust that each would abide by its part of the agreement. An ideal federal system has both aspects : mutual trust and agreement to live together. \nThe exact balance of power \nbetween the central and the state government varies from one federation to another.  This balance depends mainly on the historical context in which the federation was formed. There are two kinds of routes through which federations have been formed. The first route involves independent States coming together on their own to form a bigger unit, so that by pooling sovereignty and retaining identity, they can increase their security. This type of ‘coming \ntogether’ federations include the \nUSA, Switzerland and Australia. In this first category of federations, all the constituent States usually have equal power and are strong vis-à-vis the federal government.\nThe second route is where a \nlarge country decides to divide its power between the constituent States and the national government. India, Spain and Belgium are examples of this kind of ‘holding together’ federations. In this second \ncategory, the Central Government tends to be more powerful vis-à-vis the States. Very often different constituent units of the federation have unequal powers. Some units are granted special powers.\nIf federalism \nworks only in big countries, why did Belgium adopt it?\nJurisdiction: The \narea over which someone has legal authority. The area may be defined in terms of geographical boundaries or in terms of certain kinds of subjects.\nIn this sense, federations are \ncontrasted with unitary governments. Under the unitary system, either there is only one level of government or the sub-units are subordinate to the central government. The central government can pass on orders to the provincial or the local government. But in a federal system, the central government cannot order the state government to do something. State government has powers of its own for which it is not answerable to the central government. Both these governments are separately answerable to the people.\nLet us look at some of the key \nfeatures of federalism : \n1 There are two or more levels (or \ntiers) of government.\n2 Different tiers of government \ngovern the same citizens, but each tier has its own \njurisdiction  \nin specific matters of legislation, taxation and administration. \n3 The jur isdictions of the respective \nlevels or tiers of government are specified in the constitution. So the existence and authority of each tier of government is constitutionally guaranteed. \n4 The fundamental provisions \nof the constitution cannot be unilaterally \nchanged by one level of \ngovernment. Such changes require the consent of both the levels of government.\n5 Courts have the power to \ninterpret the constitutio\nn and \nthe powers of different levels of government. The highest court acts as an umpire if disputes arise  \nbetween different levels of government in the exercise of their respective powers.\n6 Sources of revenue for each level \nof government \nare clearly specified \nto ensure its financial autonomy. \nChapter 2.indd   15 08-04-2022   12:30:50\n2024-25"

What about a vast country like India, with so many languages, religions and regions? What are the power sharing arrangements in  \nour country?\nLet us begin with the Constitution. \nIndia had emerged as an independent nation after a painful and bloody partition. Soon after Independence, several princely states became a part of the country. The Constitution declared India as a Union of States. Although it did not use the word federation, the Indian Union is based on the principles of federalism. \nLet us go back to the seven \nfeatures of federalism mentioned above. We can see that all these features apply to the provisions of the Indian Constitution. The Constitution originally provided for a two-tier system of government, the Union Government or what we call the Central Government, representing the Union of India and the State governments. Later, a third tier of federalism was added in the form of Panchayats and Municipalities. As in any federation, these different tiers enjoy separate jurisdiction.  The Constitution clearly provided a three-fold distribution of legislative powers between the Union Government and the State Governments. Thus, it contains three lists: \n\n Union List include\ns subjects \nof national importance, such as \ndefence of the country, foreign affairs, banking, communications and currency. They are included in this list because we need a uniform policy on these matters throughout the country. The Union Government alone can make laws relating to the subjects mentioned in the Union\n List.\n State List contains subjects\n \nof State and local importance, such as police, trade, commerce, agriculture and irrigation. The State Governments alone can make laws relating to the subjects mentioned in the State List.\n\n Concurrent List include\ns \nsubjects of common interest to \nboth the Union Government as well as the State Governments, such What makes India a federal country?\nChapter 2.indd   16 08-04-2022   12:30:52\n2024-25"

Both the Union as well as the State Governments can make laws on the subjects mentioned in this list. If their laws conflict with each other, the law made by the Union Government will prevail. \nWhat about subjects that do not \nfall in any of the three lists? Or subjects like computer software that came up after the constitution was made?  According to our constitution, the Union Government has the power to legislate on these ‘residuary’ subjects. \nWe noted above that most \nfederations that are formed by ‘holding together’ do not give equal power to its constituent units. Thus, all States in the Indian Union do not have identical powers. Some States enjoy a special status. States such as Assam, Nagaland, Arunachal Pradesh and Mizoram enjoy special powers under certain provisions of the Constitution of India (Article 371) due to their peculiar social and historical circumstances. These special powers are especially enjoyed in relation to the protection of land rights of indigenous peoples, their culture and also preferential employment in government services.  Indians who are not permanent residents of this State cannot buy land or house here. Similar special provisions exist for some other States of India as well.\nListen to one national and one regional news bulletin broadcast by All India \nRadio daily for one week. Make a list of news items related to government \npolicies or decisions by classifying these into the following categories:\n News items that relate only to the Central Gov\nernment,\n News items that relate only to your or any other\n State Government,\n News items about the relationship between the Central and State Go\nvernments.There are some units of the \nIndian Union which enjoy very little \npower. These are areas which are too small to become an independent State but which could not be merged with any of the existing States. These areas, like Chandigarh, or Lakshadweep or the capital city of Delhi, are called Union Territories. These territories do not have the powers of a State. The Central Government has special powers in running these areas.\nThis sharing of power between \nthe Union Government and the State Governments is basic to the structure of the Constitution. It is not easy to make changes to this power sharing arrangement. The Parliament cannot on its own change this arrangement.  Any change to it has to be first passed by both the Houses of Parliament with at least two-thirds majority. Then it has to be ratified by the legislatures of at least half of the total States. \nThe judiciary plays an important \nrole in overseeing the implementation of constitutional provisions and procedures. In case of any dispute about the division of powers, the High Courts and the Supreme Court make a decision. The Union and State Governments have the power to raise resources by levying taxes in order to carry on the government and the responsibilities assigned to each of them. \nIf agriculture and \ncommerce are state subjects, why do we have ministers of agriculture and commerce in the Union cabinet?\nChapter 2.indd   17 08-04-2022   12:30:53\n2024-25"

If the federal experiment has succeeded in India, it is not merely because of the clearly laid out constitutional provisions. The real success of federalism in India can be attributed to the nature of democratic politics in our country. This ensured that the spirit of federalism, respect for diversity and desire for living together became shared ideals in our country. Let us look at some of the major ways in which this happened.\nLinguistic States\nThe creation of linguistic States was the first and a major test for democratic politics in our country.  If you look at the political map of \nIndia when it began its journey as a democracy in 1947 and that of 2019, you will be surprised by the extent of the changes. Many old States have vanished and many new States have been created. Areas, boundaries and names of the States have been changed. \nIn 1947, the boundaries of several \nold States of India were changed in order to create new States. This was done to ensure that people who spoke the same language lived in the same State. Some States were created not on the basis of language but to recognise differences based on culture, ethnicity or geography. These include States like Nagaland, Uttarakhand and Jharkhand.\n\tHas your village  / town  / city \nremained under the same State \nsince Independence?

                "text": "20\nDemocratic PoliticsWhen the demand for the \nformation of States on the basis of \nlanguage was raised, some national leaders feared that it would lead to the disintegration of the country. The Central Government resisted linguistic States for some time. But the experience has shown that the formation of linguistic States has actually made the country more united. It has also made administration easier.\nLanguage policy\nA second test for Indian federation is the language policy. Our Constitution did not give the status of national language to any one language. Hindi was identified as the official language. But Hindi is the mother tongue of only about 40 per cent of Indians. Therefore, there were many safeguards to protect other languages. Besides Hindi, there are 22 other languages recognised as Scheduled Languages by the Constitution. A candidate in an examination conducted for the Central Government positions may opt to take the examination in any of these languages. States too have their own official languages. Much of the government work takes place in the official language of the  \nconcerned State. \nUnlike Sri Lanka, the leaders \nof our country adopted a very cautious attitude in spreading the use of Hindi. According to the Constitution, the use of English for official purposes was to stop in 1965. However, many non-Hindi speaking States demanded that the use of English  continue. In Tamil Nadu, this movement took a violent form. The Central Government responded by agreeing to continue the use of English along with Hindi for official purposes. Many critics think that this solution favoured the English-speaking elite. Promotion of Hindi continues to be the official policy of the Government of India. Promotion does not mean that the Central Government can impose Hindi on States where people speak a different language. The flexibility shown by Indian political leaders helped our country avoid the kind of situation that Sri Lanka finds itself in. \nCentre-State relations\nRestructuring the Centre-State relations is one more way in which federalism has been strengthened in practice. How the constitutional arrangements for sharing power work in reality depends to a large extent on how the ruling parties and leaders follow these arrangements. For a long time, the same party ruled both at the Centre and in most of the States. This meant that the State Governments did not exercise their rights as autonomous federal units. As and when the ruling party at the State level was different, the parties that ruled at the Centre tried to undermine the power of the States.  In those days, the Central Government would often misuse the Constitution to dismiss the State Governments that were controlled by rival parties. This undermined the spirit of federalism. \nAll this changed significantly \nafter 1990. This period saw the rise of regional political parties in many States of the country. This was also the beginning of the era of \ncoalition  governments  at the \nCentre. Since no single party got a clear majority in the Lok Sabha, the major national parties had to enter into an alliance with many parties including several regional parties to form a government at the Centre.  \nCoalition government:  \nA government formed \nby the coming together of at least two political parties. Usually partners in a coalition form a political alliance and adopt a common programme.\nWhy Hindi? \nWhy not Bangla or Telugu?\nChapter 2.indd   20 19/03/2024   10:40:43\n2024-25"

This trend was supported by a major judgement of the Supreme Court that made it difficult for the Central Government to dismiss state governments in an arbitrary manner. Thus, federal power sharing is more effective today than it was in the early years after the Constitution came into force.\nChapter 2.indd   21 08-04-2022   12:31:05\n2024-25"

The latest information that we have is from the Census of India held in 2011. This census recorded more than 1300 distinct languages which people mentioned as their mother tongues. These languages were grouped together under some major languages. For example, languages like Bhojpuri, Magadhi, Bundelkhandi, Chhattisgarhi, Rajasthani and many others were grouped together under ‘Hindi’.  Even after this grouping, the Census found 121 major languages. Of these, 22 languages are now included in the Eighth Schedule of the Indian Constitution and are therefore called ‘Scheduled Languages’. Others are called  ‘non-Scheduled Languages’. In terms of languages, India is  perhaps the most diverse country  in the world.\nA look at the enclosed table \nmakes it clear that no one \nlanguage is the mother tongue of the majority of our population.  The largest language, Hindi, is the mother tongue of only about 44  per cent Indians. If we add to that all those who knew Hindi as their second or third language, the total number was still less than 50 per cent in 2011. As for English, only 0.02 per cent Indians recorded it as their mother tongue. Another 11 per cent knew it as a second or third language. \nRead this table carefully, but \nyou need not memorise it.

But a vast country like India cannot be run only through these  \ntwo-tiers. States in India are as large as independent countries of Europe. In terms of population, Uttar Pradesh is bigger than Russia, Maharashtra is about as big as Germany. Many of these States are internally very diverse. There is thus a need for power sharing within these States. Federal power sharing in India needs another tier of  government, below that of the State governments. This is the rationale for decentralisation of power. Thus, resulted a third-tier of government, called local government. \nWhen power is taken away from \nCentral and State governments and given to local government, it is called decentralisation. The basic idea behind decentralisation is that there are a large number of problems and issues which are best settled at the local level. People have better knowledge of problems in their localities. They also have better ideas on where to spend money and how to manage things more efficiently. Besides, at the local level it is possible for the people to directly participate in decision making. This helps to inculcate a habit of democratic participation. Local government is the best way to realise  one  important principle of democracy, namely local self-government.\nThe need for decentralisation \nwas recognised in our Constitution. Since then, there have been several attempts to decentralise \nSo, we are like a \nthree-tier coach in a train! I always prefer the lower berth! power to the level of villages and \ntowns. Panchayats in villages and municipalities in urban areas were set up in all the States. But these were directly under the control of state governments. Elections to these local governments were not held regularly. Local governments did not have any powers or resources of their own. Thus, there was very little decentralisation in effective\n terms. \nA major step towards decentra-\nli\nsation was taken in 1992. The \nConstitution was amended to make the third-tier of democracy more powerful and effective. \n\n Now it is constitutionally \nmandatory to hold \nregular elections \nto local government bodies. \n Seats are reserved in the elected \nbodies and the executive \nheads of \nthese institutions for the Scheduled \nCastes, Scheduled Tribes and Other Backward Classes. \n\n At lea\nst one-third of all positions \nare reserved for women. \n An independent i\nnstitution \ncalled the State Election Commission \nhas been created in each State to conduct panchayat and municipal elections. \n\n The State governmen\nts are \nrequired to share some powers and \nrevenue with local government bodies. The nature of sharing varies from State to State. \nRural local government is \npopularly known by the name panchayati raj. Each village, or a group of villages in some States, has a gram panchayat. This is a council consisting of several ward members, often called panch, and a president or sarpanch. They are directly Decentralisation in India\nChapter 2.indd   24 08-04-2022   12:31:16\n2024-25"

The city has set up a parallel organisation operating alongside the municipal council, enabling local inhabitants to take real decisions for their city. The nearly 13 lakh people in this city get to participate in making the budget for their own city. The city is divided into many sectors or what we call wards. Each sector has a meeting, like that of the gram sabha, in which anyone living in that area can participate. There are some meetings to discuss issues that affect the entire city. Any citizen of the city can participate in those meetings. The budget of the city is discussed in these meetings. The proposals are put to the municipality that takes a final decision about it.\nAbout 20,000 people participate in this decision making exercise every year. \nThis method has ensured that the money cannot be spent only for the benefit of the colonies where rich people live. Buses now run to the poor colonies and builders cannot evict slum-dwellers without resettling them. \nIn our own country, a similar experiment has taken place in some areas in \nKerala.

Political \nexpression of social differences is possible and sometimes quite desirable in a democratic system. In this chapter we apply these ideas to the practice of democracy in India. We look at three kinds of social differences that can take the form of social divisions and inequalities. These are social differences based on gender, religion and caste. In each case we look at the nature of this division in India and how it gets expressed in politics. We also ask whether different expressions based on these differences are healthy or otherwise in a democracy. \nChapter 3.indd   29 08-04-2022   14:15:08\n2024-25"

The gender division tends to be understood as natural and unchangeable. However, it is not based on biology but on social expectations and stereotypes.Public/private division\nBoys and girls are brought up to believe that the main responsibility of women is housework and bringing up children. This is reflected in a \nsexual  division  of labour  in most \nfamilies: women do all work inside the home such as cooking, cleaning, washing clothes, tailoring, looking after children, etc., and men do all the work outside the home. It is not that men cannot do housework; they simply think that it is for women to attend to these things. When these jobs are paid for, men are ready to take up these works. Most tailors or cooks in hotels are men. Similarly, it is not that women do not work outside their home. In villages, women fetch water, collect fuel and  work in the fields. In urban areas, poor women work as domestic helper in middle class homes, while middle class women work in offices. In fact, the majority of women do some sort of paid work in addition to domestic labour. But their work is not valued and does not get recognition.\nThe result of this division of \nlabour is that although women constitute half of the humanity, their role in public life, especially politics, is minimal in most societies. Earlier, only men were allowed to participate in public affairs, vote and contest for public offices. Gradually the gender issue was raised in politics. Women in different parts of the world organised and agitated for equal rights. There were agitations in different countries for the extension of voting rights to women.  \nA poster from Bengal affirming women’s \nstrength. \nSexual division of labour:  \nA system in which all work inside the home is either done by the women of the family, or organised by them through the domestic helpers. \nWhy not?

                "text": "36\nDemocratic Politics\nReligion, communalism and politics \nLet us now turn to a very different \nkind of social division, the division based on religious differences. This division is not as universal as gender, but religious diversity is fairly widespread in the world today. Many countries including India have in their population, followers of different religions. As we noticed in the case of Northern Ireland, even when most of the people belong to the same religion, there can be serious differences about the way people practice that religion. Unlike gender differences, the religious differences are often expressed in the field of politics.\nConsider the following:\n Gandhiji used to say that \nrel\nigion can never be separated \nfrom politics. What he meant by \nreligion was not any particular religion like Hinduism or Islam but moral values that inform all religions. He believed that politics must be guided by ethics drawn from religion.\n\n Human rights gr\noups in our \ncountry have demanded that the \nGovernment should take special steps to prevent communal riots and protect religious minorities.\n\n Women’s \nmovement has argued \nthat family  laws  of all religions \ndiscriminate against women. \nSo they have demanded that government should change these laws to make them more equitable.\nAll these instances involve \na relationship between religion \nI am not \nreligious. Why should I bother about communalism and secularism?and politics. But they do not \nseem very wrong or dangerous. Ideas, ideals and values drawn from different religions can and perhaps should play a role in politics. People should be able to express in politics their needs, interests and demands as a member of a religious community. Those who hold political power should sometimes be able to regulate the practice of religion so as to prevent discrimination and oppression. These political acts are not wrong as long as they treat every religion equally.\nCommunalism\nThe problem begins when religion is seen as the basis of the nation. The example of Northern Ireland in Chapter 3 shows the dangers of such an approach to nationalism. The problem becomes more acute when religion is expressed in politics in exclusive and partisan terms, when one religion and its followers are pitted against another. This happens when beliefs of one religion are presented as superior to those of other religions, when the demands of one religious group are formed in opposition to another and when state power is used to establish domination of one religious group over the rest. This manner of using religion in politics is communal\n politics. \nComm\nunal politics is based \non the idea that religion is the \nprincipal basis of social community. Communalism involves thinking \nChapter 3.indd   36 02/04/2024   11:58:46\n2024-25"

Any difference that they may have is irrelevant or trivial for community life. It also follows that people who follow different religions cannot belong to the same \nsocial community. If the followers of different religions have some commonalities these are superficial and immaterial, their interests are bound to be different and involve a conflict. In its extreme form, communalism leads to the belief that people belonging to different religions cannot live as equal citizens  \nwithin one nation. Either, one of them has to dominate the rest or they have to form different nations.\nThis belief is fundamentally \nflawed.  People of one religion do not have the same interests and aspirations in every context. Everyone has several other roles, positions and identities. There are many voices inside every community. All these voices have a right to be heard. Therefore any attempt to bring all followers of one religion together in context other than religion is bound to suppress many voices within that community. \nCommunalism can take various \nforms in politics:\n\n The mos\nt common expression \nof communalism is in everyday \nbeliefs. These routinely involve religious prejudices, stereotypes of religious communities and belief in the superiority of one’s religion over other religions. This is so common Family laws:  Those \nlaws that deal with \nfamily related matters such as marriage, divorce, adoption, inheritance, etc. In our country, different family laws apply to followers of different religions.\nthat we often fail to notice it, even \nwhen we believe in it.\n A commu\nnal mind often leads to a \nquest for political dominance of one’s \nown religious community. For those belonging to majority community, this takes the form of majoritarian dominance. For those belonging to the minority community, it can take the form of a desire to form a separate political\n unit.\n Political mob\nilisation on \nreligious lines is another frequent form of communalism. This involves the use of sacred symbols, religious leaders, emotional appeal and plain fear in order to bring the followers of one religion together in the political arena. In electoral politics, this often involves special appeal to the interests or emotions of voters of one religion in preference to others.\n\n Sometimes communalism takes \nits \nmost ugly form of communal \nviolence, riots and massacre. India \nand Pakistan suffered some of the worst communal riots at the time of the Partition. The post-Independence period has also seen large scale communal violence. \nSecular state\nCommunalism was and continues \nto be one of the major challenges to democracy in our country. The makers of our Constitution were aware of this challenge. That is why, they chose the model of a secular state. This choice was reflected in several constitutional provisions that we studied last year:\n\n There is no official \nreligion for \nthe Indian state.

For example, it bans untouchability.\nUnderstood in this sense, \nsecularism is not just an ideology of some parties or persons. This idea constitutes one of the foundations of our country. Communalism should not be seen as a threat to some people in India. It threatens the very idea of India. That is why communalism needs to be combated. A secular Constitution like ours is necessary but not sufficient to combat communalism. Communal prejudices and propaganda need to be countered in everyday life and religion- based mobilisation needs to be countered in the arena of politics.\nCaste and politics \nWe have seen two instances of the \nexpression of social divisions in the arena of politics, one largely positive and the other largely negative. Let us turn to our final case, that of caste and politics, that has both positive and the negative aspects.Caste inequalities\nUnlike gender and religion, caste \ndivision is special to India. All societies have some kind of social inequality and some form of division of labour. In most societies, occupations are passed on from one generation to another. Caste system is an extreme form of this. What makes it different from other societies is that in this \nsystem, hereditary occupational \ndivision was sanctioned by rituals. Members of the same caste group were supposed to form a social community that practiced the same or similar occupation, married within the caste group and did not eat with members from other caste\n groups. \nCaste system was based on \nexclusi\non of and discrimination \nagainst the ‘outcaste’ groups. They were subjected to the inhuman practice of untouchability about which you have studied in Class IX. That is why political leaders and social reformers like Jotiba \nPhule, Gandhiji, B.R. Ambedkar  \nand Periyar Ramaswami Naicker advocated and worked to establish a society in which caste inequalities are absent. \nPartly due to their efforts and \npartly due to other socio-economic  \nchanges, castes and caste system in modern India have undergone great changes. With economic development, large scale  \nurbanisation , growth of literacy and \neducation, occupational  mobility  \nand the weakening of the position of landlords in the villages, the old notions of \ncaste  hierarchy  are \nbreaking down.

If someone says she has ‘no religion’ or that he is an ‘atheist’, this is exactly how it is recorded. Thus we have reliable information on the proportion of different religious communities in the country and how it has changed over the years. The pie chart below presents the population proportion of six major religious communities in the country. Since Independence, the total population of each community has increased substantially but their proportion in the country’s population has not changed much. In percentage terms, the population of the Hindus, Jains and Christians has declined marginally since 1961. The proportion of Muslim, Sikh and Buddhist population has increased slightly. There is a common but mistaken impression that the proportion of the Muslims in the country’s population is going to overtake other religious communities. Expert estimates done for the Prime Minister’s High Level Committee (popularly known as Sachar Committee) show that the proportion of the Muslims is expected to go up a little, by about 3 to 4 per cent, in the next 50 years. It proves that in overall terms, the population balance of different religious communities is not likely to change in a big way.\nThe same is true of the major caste groups. The Census of India counts two social \ngroups: the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes. Both these broad groups include hundreds of castes or tribes whose names are listed in an official Schedule. Hence the prefix ‘Scheduled’ in their name. The Scheduled Castes, commonly known as Dalits, include those that were previously regarded as ‘outcaste’ in the Hindu social \norder and were subjected to exclusion and untouchability. The Scheduled Tribes, often referred to as Adivasis, include those communities that led a secluded life usually in hills \nand forests and did not interact much with the rest of society. In 2011, the Scheduled Castes were 16.6 per cent and the Scheduled Tribes were 8.6 per cent of the country’s population. \nThe Census does not yet count the \nOther Backward Classes, the group we discussed in Class IX. Hence there are some differences about their proportion in the country’s population. The National Sample Survey of  \n2004–05 estimates their population to be around 41 per cent. Thus the SC, ST and the OBC together account for about two-thirds of the country’s population and about three-fourths of the Hindu population. \nPopulation of different religious\ncommunities in India, 2011\nHindu79.8\nMuslim14.2\nOthers 2%\nChristian 2.3\nSikh 1.7 Others include Buddhist 0.7% Jain 0.4%\nOther Religions and Persuasions 0.7%  \nReligion not stated  0.2%\nSource: Census of India, 2011In %\nChapter 3.indd   39 08-04-2022   14:15:31\n2024-25"

The Constitution of India prohibited any caste-based discrimination and laid the foundations of policies to reverse the injustices of the caste system. If a person who lived a century ago were to return to India, she would be greatly surprised at the change that has come about in the country.\nYet caste has not disappeared \nfrom contemporary India. Some of the older aspects of caste have persisted. Even now most people marry within their own caste or tribe. Untouchability has not ended completely, despite constitutional prohibition. Effects of centuries of advantages and disadvantages continue to be felt today. The caste groups that had access to education under the old system have done very well in acquiring modern education as well. Those groups that did not have access to education or were prohibited from acquiring it have naturally lagged behind. That is why there is a disproportionately large presence of ‘upper caste’ among the urban middle classes in our country. Caste continues to be closely linked to economic status.  \n(See Plus Box on Page 41.)\nCaste in politics\nAs in the case of communalism, casteism is rooted in the belief that caste is the sole basis of social community. According to this way of thinking, people belonging to the same caste belong to a natural social community and have the same interests which they do not share with anyone from another caste. As we saw in the case of communalism, such a belief is not borne out by our experience. Caste is one aspect of our experience but it is not the only relevant or the most important\n aspect.\nCas\nte can take various forms \nin politics:\n When parties choose candidates \nin elections, they keep in mind the caste \ncomposition of the electorate \nand nominate candidates from different castes so as to muster necessary support to win elections. When governments are formed, political parties usually take care that representatives of different castes and tribes find a place in it.\n\n Politica\nl parties and candidates \nin elections make appeals to caste \nsentiment to muster support.

Although this kind of explicit and formalised inequality based on caste is now outlawed, the effects of centuries of accumulated advantages and disadvantages continue to be felt.  Moreover, new kinds of inequalities have also developed.\nThe relationship between caste and economic status has certainly changed a \nlot.  Today, it is possible to find very rich and very poor people in every caste, whether ‘low’ or ‘high’.  This was not true even twenty or thirty years ago – it was very rare indeed to find rich people among the ‘lowest’ castes. However, as this evidence from the National Sample Survey shows, caste continues to be very strongly linked to economic status in many important ways: \n\n The average economic status (measured b\ny criteria like monthly \nconsumption expenditure) of caste groups still follows the old hier archy – \nthe ‘upper’ castes are best off, the Dalits and Adivasis are worst off, and the \nbackward classes are in between.   \n Although every caste has some poor members, the proportion living in \nextreme po\nverty (below the official ‘poverty line’) is much higher for the lowest \ncastes and much lower for the upper castes, with the backward classes once \nagain in between.\n Although every caste has some members who are rich, the upper castes are \nhea\nvily over-represented among the rich while the lower castes are severely \nunder-represented.\nPercentage of population living below the poverty line, 1999–—––—— —2000\nCaste and Community groups Rural Urban \nScheduled Tribes 45.8 35.6\nScheduled Castes 35.9 38.3\nOther Backward Classes 27.0 29.5\nMuslim Upper Castes 26.8 34.2\nHindu Upper Castes 11.7 9.9\nChristian Upper Castes 9.6 5.4\nSikh Upper Castes 0.0 4.9\nOther Upper Castes 16.0 2.7\nAll Groups 27.0 23.4\nNote: ‘Upper Caste’ here means those who are not from SC, ST, or OBC.

It also brought new consciousness among the people of castes that were hitherto treated as inferior and low.\nThe focus on caste in politics \ncan sometimes give an impression that elections are all about caste and nothing else. That is far from true. Just consider these:\n\n No parliamentary constituency \nin the country has a clear majority \nof one single \ncaste. So, every \ncandidate and party needs to win the confidence of more than one caste and community to win elections.\n\n No party\n wins the votes of all \nthe voters of a caste or community. \nWhen people say that a caste is a ‘vote bank’ of one party, it usually means that a large proportion of the voters from that caste vote for that\n party.\n Many political parties may put \nup\n candidates from the same caste \n(if that caste is believed to dominate the electorate in a particular constituency). Some voters have more than one candidate from their caste while many voters have no candidate from their caste.\n\n The ruling party and the \nsitting \nMP or MLA frequently lose elections \nin our country. That could not have happened if all castes and communities were frozen in their political preferences.\nClearly, while caste matters in \nelectoral politics, so do many other factors. The voters have strong attachment to political parties which is often stronger than their attachment to their caste or community. People within the same caste or community have different interests depending on their economic condition. Rich and poor or men and women from the same caste often vote very differently. People’s assessment of the performance of the government and the popularity rating of the leaders matter and are often decisive in elections.\nPolitics in caste\nWe have so far looked at what caste does to politics. But it does not mean that there is only a one-way relation between caste and politics. Politics too influences the caste system and caste identities by bringing them into the political arena.

This \ntakes several forms:\n Each caste group tries \nto become \nbigger by incorporating within it \nneighbouring castes or sub-castes which were earlier excluded from it.\n\n Various caste groups are required \nto enter into \na coalition with other \ncastes or communities and thus enter \ninto a dialogue and negotiation.\n New kinds of cas\nte groups \nhave come up in the political arena \nlike ‘backward’ and ‘forward’ caste\n groups.\nThus, caste plays dif\nferent \nkinds of roles in politics. In some situations, expression of caste differences in politics gives many disadvantaged communities the space to demand their share of power. In this sense, caste politics \nhas helped people from Dalits and \nOBC castes to gain better access to decision making. Several political and non-political organisations have been demanding and agitating for an end to discrimination against particular castes, for more dignity and more access to land, resources and opportunities. \nAt the same time, exclusive \nattention to caste can produce negative results as well. As in the case of religion, politics based on caste identity alone is not very healthy in a democracy. It can divert attention from other pressing issues like poverty, development and corruption.

In Class IX, we noticed the role of political parties in the rise of democracies, in the formation of constitutional designs, in electoral politics and in the making and working of governments. In this textbook, we have glanced at political parties as vehicles of federal sharing of political power and as negotiators of social divisions in the arena of democratic politics. Before concluding this tour, let us take a close look at the nature and working of political parties, especially in our country. We begin by asking two common questions: Why do we need parties? How many parties are good for a democracy? In the light of these, we introduce the national and regional political parties in today’s India and then look at what is wrong with political parties and what can be done about it.Political Parties\nChapter 4.indd   46 08-04-2022   12:33:27\n2024-25"

For most ordinary citizens, democracy is equal to political parties. If you travel to remote parts of our country and speak to the less educated citizens, you could come across people who may not know anything about our Constitution or about the nature of our government. But chances are that they would know something about our political parties. At the same time, this visibility does not mean popularity. Most people tend to be very critical of political parties. They tend to blame parties for all that is wrong with our democracy and our political life. Parties have become identified with social and political\n divisions. \nTherefo\nre, it is natural to ask  – do \nwe need po\nlitical parties at all? About \nhundred years ago, there were few countries of the world that had any political party. Now there are few that do not have parties. Why did political parties become so omnipresent in democracies all over the world? Let us first answer what political parties are and what they do, before we say why we need them.\nMeaning\nA political party is a group of people who come together to contest elections and hold power in the government. They agree on some policies and programmes for the society with a view to promote the collective good. Since there can be different views on what is good for \nSo, you agree \nwith me.

Partisanship \nis marked by a \ntendency to take a \nside and inability \nto take a balanced \nview on an issue. \n© RK Laxman - Brushing up the years  \nall, parties try to persuade people \nwhy their policies are better than others. They seek to implement these policies by winning popular support through elections.\nThus, parties reflect fundamental \npolitical divisions in a society. Parties are about a part of the society and thus, involve \npartisanship . Thus, \na party is known by which part it stands for, which policies it supports and whose interests it upholds. A political party has three components: \n the leaders, \n the active members and \n the followers\nFunctions\nWhat does a political party do? Basically,  political parties fill political offices and exercise political power. Parties do so by performing a series of functions: \n1 Parties contest elections . In most \ndemocracies, elections are fought mainly among the candidates put up by political parties. Parties select their candidates in different ways. In some countries, such as the USA, members and supporters of a party choose its candidates. Now more and more countries are following this method. In other countries like India, top party leaders choose candidates for contesting elections. \n2 Parties  put forward different \npolicies and programmes and the voters choose from them. Each of us may have different opinions and views on what policies are suitable for the society. But no government can handle such a large variety of views. In a democracy, a large number of similar opinions have to be grouped together to provide a direction in which policies can be formulated by the governments. This is what the parties do. A party reduces a vast multitude of opinions into a few basic positions which it \nChapter 4.indd   48 08-04-2022   12:33:33\n2024-25"

A government is expected \nto base its policies on the line taken by the \nruling  party . \n3 Partie s play a decisive role \nin making laws for a country. \nFormally, laws are debated and passed in the legislature. But since most of the members belong to a party, they go by the direction of the party leadership, irrespective of their personal opinions.\n4 Partie s form and run governments.  \nAs we noted last year, the big policy decisions are taken by political executive that comes from the political parties. Parties recruit leaders, train them and then make them ministers to run the government in the way they want.\n5 Those partie s that lose in the \nelections play the role of opposition  \nto the parties in power, by voicing different views and criticising government for its failures or wrong policies. Opposition parties also mobilise opposition to the government.\n6 Parties shape public opinion. \nThey raise and highlight issues. Parties have lakhs of members and activists spread all over the country. Many of the pressure groups are the extensions of political parties among different sections of society. Parties sometimes also launch movements for the resolution of problems faced by people. Often opinions in the society crystallise on the lines parties\n take. \n7 Parties provide people access \nto government machinery and welfare schemes implemented by governments. For an ordinary citizen it is easy to approach a local party leader than a government officer. That is why, they feel close to parties even when they do not fully trust them.  Parties have to be responsive to people’s needs and demands. Otherwise people can reject those parties in the next\n elections.\nNecessity\nThis list of functions in a sense answers the question asked above: we need political parties because they perform all these functions. But we still need to ask why modern democracies cannot exist without political parties.  We can understand the necessity of political parties by imagining a situation without parties. Every candidate in the elections will be independent. So no one will be able to make any promises to the people about any major policy changes. The government may be formed, but its utility will remain ever uncertain. Elected representatives will be accountable to their constituency for what they do in the locality. But no one will be responsible for how the country will be run.\nWe can also think about it by \nlooking at the non-party based elections to the panchayat in many states. Although, the parties do not contest formally, it is generally noticed that the village gets split into more than one faction, each of which puts up a ‘panel’ of its candidates. This is exactly what the party does. That is the reason we find political parties in almost all countries of the world, whether these countries are big or small, old or new, developed or developing. \nThe rise of political parties is \ndirectly linked to the emergence of representative democracies. \nRuling Party: Political \nparty that runs government.\nChapter 4.indd   49 08-04-2022   12:33:34\n2024-25"

They needed a mechanism to support or restrain the government, make policies, justify or oppose them. Political parties fulfill these needs that every representative government has. We can say that parties are a necessary condition for a democracy.\nHow many parties should we have?\nIn a democracy any group of citizens is free to form a political party.  In this formal sense, there are a large number of political parties in each country. More than 750 parties are registered with the Election Commission of India. But not all these parties are serious contenders in the elections. Usually only a handful of parties are effectively in the race to win elections and form the government. So the question is: how many major or effective parties are good for a democracy?\nIn some countries, only one \nparty is allowed to control and run the government. These are called one-party systems. In Class IX, we noted that in China, only the Communist Party is allowed to 1: Activists of BJP Mahila Morcha demonstrate against hike in prices of onions and LPG in  \nVisakhapatnam.\n2: Minister distributes ` One lakh cheque to the families of hooch victims at their houses.\n3: Activists of CPI (M), CPI, OGP and JD (S) take out a rally in Bhubaneswar to protest against \nPOSCO, the Korean steel company for being permitted by the State Government to export iron ore from Orissa to feed steel plants in China and Korea.\n© (1) C V Subrahmanyan (2) K Gopinathan (3) A Chakrabarty, The Hindu\n1\n 3\n2\nChapter 4.indd   50 08-04-2022   12:33:38\n2024-25"

Although, legally speaking, \npeople are free to form political parties, it does not happen because the electoral system does not permit free competition for power. We cannot consider one-party system as a good option because this is not a democratic option. Any democratic system must allow at least two parties to compete in elections and provide a fair chance for the competing parties to come to power. \nIn some countries, power usually \nchanges between two main parties. Several other parties may exist, contest elections and win a few seats in the national legislatures. But only the two main parties have a serious chance of winning majority of seats to form government. Such a party system is called two-party system. The United States of America and the United Kingdom are examples of two-party system. \nIf several parties compete for \npower, and more than two parties have a reasonable chance of coming to power either on their own strength or in alliance with others, we call it a multiparty system. Thus in India, we have a multiparty system. In this system, the government is formed by various parties coming together in a coalition. When several parties in a \nmulti-party system join hands for the purpose of contesting elections and winning power, it is called an alliance or a front. For example, in India there were three such major alliances in 2004 parliamentary elections– the National Democratic Alliance, the United Progressive Alliance and the Left Front. The multiparty system often appears very messy and leads to political instability. At the same time, this system allows a variety of interests and opinions to enjoy political representation.\nSo, which of these is better? \nPerhaps the best answer to this very common question is that this is not a very good question. Party system is not something any country can choose. It evolves over a long time, depending on the nature of society, its social and regional divisions, its history of politics and its system of elections. These cannot be changed very quickly. Each country develops a party system that is conditioned by its special circumstances. For example, if India has evolved a multiparty system, it is because the social and geographical diversity in such a large country is not easily absorbed by two or even three parties. No system is ideal for all countries and all situations.\nI wonder how \npoliticians manage these coalitions. I can’t even remember the names of all the parties.\nLet us apply what we have learnt about party systems to the various states within India. Here are three major types of party systems that \nexist at the State level. Can you find the names of at least two States for \neach of these types?\n\tTwo-party system\n\tMultiparty system with two alliances\n\n Multiparty system\nChapter 4.indd   51 08-04-2022   12:33:39\n2024-25"

Founded in 1885 and \nhas experienced many splits. Played a dominant role in Indian politics at the national and state level for several decades after India’s Independence. Under the leadership of Jawaharlal Nehru, the party sought to build a modern secular democratic republic in India. Ruling party at the centre till 1977 and then from 1980 to 1989. After 1989, its support declined, but it continues to be present throughout the country, cutting across social divisions. A centrist party (neither rightist nor leftist) in its ideological orientation, the party \nespouses secularism and welfare of weaker sections and minorities. The INC supports new economic reforms but with a human face.  Leader of the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government from 2004 to 2019. In the 2019 Lok Sabha election, it won 19.5% votes and 52 seats.\nNational People’s Party (NPP): Formed in July 2013 under the leadership of P.A Sangma. NPP is the first political party from North East India to have attained \nthe status of a national party. It believes in diversity of the country and recognizes that different regions have different developmental challenges. The core philosophy of the party is education and employment to all as well as empowerment of all sections of the society. It formed government in Meghalaya and has presence in many of North Eastern States. In the Lok Sabha election held in 2019, NPP secured one seat in the Lok Sabha.\nState parties\nOther than these seven parties, most \nof the major parties of the country are classified by the Election Commission as ‘State parties’. These are commonly referred to as regional parties. Yet these parties need not be regional in their ideology or outlook. Some of these parties are all India parties that happen to have succeeded only in some states. Parties like the Samajwadi Party and Rashtriya Janata Dal have national level political organisation with units in several states. Some of  \nthese parties like Biju Janata Dal, Sikkim Democratic Front,  Mizo National  \nFront and Telangana Rashtra Samithi are conscious about their State identity. Over the last three decades, the \nnumber and strength of these parties has expanded. This made the Parliament of India politically more and more diverse. No one national party is able to secure on its own a majority in the Lok Sabha, until 2014. As a result, the national parties are compelled to form alliances with State parties. Since 1996, nearly every one of the State parties has got an opportunity to be a part of one or the other national level coalition government. This has contributed to the strengthening of federalism and democracy in our country. (See the map on the next page for details of these parties).\nChapter 4.indd   55 02/04/2024   12:48:42\n2024-25"

Since parties are the most visible face of democracy, it is natural that people blame parties for whatever is wrong with the working of democracy. All over the world, people express strong dissatisfaction with the failure of political parties to perform their functions well.  This is the case in our country too. Popular dissatisfaction and criticism has focussed on four problem areas in the working of political parties. Political parties need to face and overcome these challenges in order to remain effective instruments  \nof democracy.\nThe first challenge is lack of  \ninternal democracy within parties. All over the world there is a tendency in political parties towards the concentration of power in one or few leaders at the top. Parties do not keep membership registers, do not hold organisational meetings, and do not conduct internal elections regularly. Ordinary members of the party do not get sufficient information on what happens inside \nthe party. They do \nnot have the means or the connections needed to influence the decisions. As a result, the leaders assume greater  power to make decisions in the name of the party. Since one or few leaders exercise paramount power in the party, those who disagree with the leadership find \nWhy don’t \nparties give enough tickets to women? Is that also due to lack of internal democracy?Berlusconi was the Prime \nMinister of Italy. He is also one of the top businessmen in Italy. He is the leader of the Forza Italia founded in 1993.

                "text": "58\nDemocratic Politicsit difficult to continue in the party. \nMore than loyalty to party principles and policies, personal loyalty to the leader becomes more important. \nThe second challenge of dynastic \nsuccession is related to the first one. Since most political parties do not practice open and transparent procedures for their functioning, there are very few ways for an ordinary worker to rise to the top in a party. Those who happen to be the leaders are in a position of unfair advantage to favour people close to them or even their family members. In many parties, the top positions are always controlled by members of one family. This is unfair to other members of that party. This is also bad for democracy, since people who do not have adequate experience or popular support come to occupy positions of power. This tendency is present in some measure all over the world, including in some of the older democracies.\n  The third challenge is about \nthe growing role \nof money and \nmuscle power in parties, especially during elections. Since parties are focussed only on winning elections, they tend to use short-cuts to win elections. They tend to nominate those candidates who have or can raise lots of money. Rich people and companies who give funds to the parties tend to have influence on the policies and decisions of the party. In some cases, parties support criminals who can win elections. Democrats all over the world are worried about the increasing role of rich people and big companies in democratic politics.\nThe fourth challenge is that \nvery often parties do not seem to offer a meaningful choice to the voters. In order to offer meaningful choice, parties must be significantly different. In recent years, there has been a decline in the ideological differences among parties in most parts of the world. For example, \nthe difference between the Labour Party and the Conservative Party in Britain is very little. They agree on more fundamental aspects but differ only in details on how policies are to be framed and implemented. In our country too, the differences among all the major parties on the economic policies have reduced. Those who want really different policies have no option available to them. Sometimes people cannot even elect very different leaders either, because the same set of leaders keep shifting from one party to another.© Huffaker - Cagle Cartoons Inc.,  16 June 2004\nThis cartoon was drawn during the Presidency of George Bush of the \nRepublican Party in the USA.

The question is: Are political parties willing to reform? If they are willing, what has prevented them from reforming so far? If they are not willing, is it possible to force them to reform? Citizens all over the world face this question. This is not a simple question to answer. In a democracy, the final decision is made by leaders who represent political parties. People can replace them, but only by another set of party leaders. If all of them do not wish to \nreform, how can anyone force them to change?\nLet us look at some of the \nrecent efforts and suggestions in our country to reform political parties and its leaders:\n\n The Constitution was amended \nto prevent elected MLAs and \nMPs \nfrom changing parties. This was done \nbecause many elected representatives were indulging in \ndefection  in order \nto become ministers or for cash rewards. Now the law says that if Defection: Changing \nparty allegiance from the party on which a person got elected (to a legislative body) to a different party.\nCan you identify which of the challenges described in this section are being \nhighlighted in these cartoons (on pages 57 to 59)?

At the same time, this has made any dissent even more difficult. MPs and MLAs have to accept whatever the party leaders decide.\n\n The Supre\nme Court passed an \norder to reduce the influence of \nmoney and criminals. Now, it is mandatory for every candidate who contests elections to file an \naffidavit  \ngiving details of his property and criminal cases pending against him. The new system has made a lot of information available to the public. But there is no system to check if the information given by the candidates is true. As yet we do not know if it has led to decline in the influence of the rich and the criminals.\n\n The Elec\ntion Commission \npassed an order making it necessary \nfor political parties to hold their organisational elections and file their income tax returns. The parties have started doing so but sometimes it is mere formality. It is not clear if this step has led to greater internal democracy in political parties.\nBesides these, many suggestions \nare often made to reform political parties: \n\n A law should be made to regulate \nthe inte\nrnal affairs of political parties. \nIt should be made compulsory for \npolitical parties to maintain a register of its members, to follow its own constitution, to have an independent authority, to act as a judge in case of party disputes, to hold open elections to the highest posts.\n\n It should be made mandatory for \npolitical \nparties to give a minimum \nnumber of tickets, about one-third, \nto women candidates. Similarly, there should be a quota for women in the decision making bodies of the\n party.\n There should be state funding of \nelections. The government s\nhould \ngive parties money to support their election expenses. This support could be given in kind: petrol, paper, telephone, etc. Or it could be given in cash on the basis of the votes secured by the party in the last election.\nThese suggestions have not yet \nbeen accepted by political parties. If and when these are accepted these could lead to some improvement. But we must be very careful about legal solutions to political problems. Over-regulation of political parties can be counter-productive. This would force all parties to find ways to cheat the law. Besides, political parties will not agree to pass a law that they do not like.\nThere are two other ways \nin which political parties can be reformed.

Read the following passage and answer the questions given \nbelow:\n  Muhammad Yunus is a famous economist of Bangladesh. \nHe received several international honours for his efforts to promote economic and social development for the benefit of the poor. He and the Grameen Bank that he started jointly, received the Nobel Peace Prize for the year 2006. In February 2007, he decided to launch a political party and contest in the parliamentary elections. His objective was to foster proper leadership, good governance and build a new Bangladesh. He felt that only a political party different from the traditional ones would bring about new political culture. His party would be democratic from the grassroots level.\n   The launching of the new party, called Nagarik Shakti \n(Citizens’ Power), has caused a stir among the Bangladeshis. While many welcomed his decision, some did not like it. “Now I think Bangladesh will have a chance to choose between good and bad and eventually have a good government,” said Shahedul Islam, a government official. “That government, we hope, would not only keep itself away from corruption but also make fighting corruption and black money a top priority.” \n   But leaders of traditional political parties who dominated \nthe country’s politics for decades were apprehensive. “There was no debate (over him) winning the Nobel, but politics is different – very challenging and often controversial,” said a senior leader of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party. Some others were highly critical. They asked why he was rushing into politics. “Is he being planted in politics by mentors from outside the country,” asked one political observer. \n Do you think Yunus made a right decision to float a new political party?\n Do you agree with the statements and fears expressed by various people?

Or, what outcomes can we reasonably expect of democracy? Also, does democracy fulfil these expectations in real life? We begin by thinking about how to assess the outcomes of democracy. After some clarity on how to think on this subject, we proceed to look at the expected and actual outcomes of democracy in various respects: quality of government, economic well-being, inequality, social differences and conflict and finally freedom and dignity. \nChapter 5.indd   63 4/29/2022   4:57:46 PM\n2024-25"

This was in Chapter 2 of Class IX textbook. It emerged from that conversation that democracy is a better form of government when compared with dictatorship or any other alternative. We felt that democracy was better because it:\n Promotes equality among citizens;\n\n Enhances the dignity of the individual;\n\n Improves the quality of decision-making;\n\n Provides a method to resolve conflicts; and\n\n Allows room to correct mi\nstakes.\nAre these expectations realised \nunder democracies? When we talk to people around us, most of them support democracy against other alternatives, such as rule by a monarch or military or religious leaders. But not so many of them would be satisfied with the democracy in practice. So we face a dilemma: democracy is seen to be good in principle, but felt to be not so good in its practice. This dilemma invites us to think hard about the outcomes of democracy. Do we prefer democracy only for moral reasons? Or are there some prudential reasons to support democracy too?\nOver a hundred countries of \nthe world today claim and practice some kind of democratic politics: they have formal constitutions, they hold elections, they have parties and they guarantee rights of citizens. While these features are common to most of them, these democracies are very much different from each other in terms of their social situations, their economic achievements and their cultures. Clearly, what may be achieved or not achieved under each of these democracies will be very different. But is there something that we can expect from every democracy, just because it is democracy?\nOur interest in and fascination \nfor democracy often pushes us into taking a position that democracy can address all socio-economic and political problems. If some of our expectations are not met, we start blaming the idea of democracy. Or, we start doubting if we are living in a democracy. The first step towards thinking carefully about the outcomes  \nof democracy is to recognise that democracy is just a form of\n government.\n It can only create \nconditions for achieving something. The citizens have to take advantage of those conditions and achieve those goals. Let us examine some of the things we can reasonably expect from democracy and examine the record of democracy.\nDid we \nreach these conclusions in Madam Lyngdoh’s class?

                "text": "Outcomes of Democracy65\nAccountable, responsive and legitimate government\nThere are some things that democracy \nmust provide. In a democracy, we are most concerned with ensuring that people will have the right to choose their rulers and people will have control over the rulers. Whenever possible and necessary, citizens should be able to participate in decision making, that affects them all. Therefore, the most basic outcome of democracy should be that it produces a government that is accountable to the citizens, and responsive to the needs and expectations of the citizens. \nBefore we go into this question, \nwe face another common question: Is the democratic government efficient? Is it effective? Some people think that democracy produces less effective government. It is, of course, true that non-democratic rulers do not have to bother about deliberation in assemblies or worry about majorities and public opinion. So, they can be very quick and efficient in decision making and implementation. Democracy is based on the idea of deliberation and negotiation. So, some delay is bound to take place. Does that make democratic government inefficient?\nLet us think in terms of costs. \nImagine a government that may take decisions very fast. But it may take decisions that are not accepted by the people and may therefore face problems. In contrast, the democratic government will take more time to follow procedures before arriving at a decision. But because it has followed procedures, its decisions may be both more acceptable to the people and more effective. So, the cost of time that democracy pays is perhaps worth it. Now look at the other side\n – \ndemocracy ensur\nes that decision \nmaking will be based on norms and \nprocedures. So, a citizen who wants to know if a decision was taken through the correct procedures can find this out. She has the right and the means to examine the process of decision making. This is known as transparency. This factor is often missing from a  \nnon-democratic government. Therefore, when we are trying to find out the outcomes of democracy, it is right to expect democracy to produce a government that follows procedures and is accountable to the people. We can also expect that the democratic government develops mechanisms for citizens to hold the government accountable and mechanisms for citizens to take part in decision making whenever they think fit. \nIf you wanted to measure \ndemocracies on the basis of this expected outcome, you would look for the following practices and institutions: regular, free and fair elections; open public debate on \n© Mike Keefe   - Cagle Cartoons Inc.\nCan you think of \nwhat and how the government knows about you and your family (for example ration cards and  voter identity cards)?

The actual performance of democracies shows a mixed record on this. Democracies have had greater success in setting up regular and free elections and in setting up conditions for open public debate. But most democracies fall short of elections that provide a fair chance to everyone and in subjecting every decision to public debate. Democratic governments do not have a very good record when it comes to sharing information with citizens. All one can say in favour of democratic regimes is that they are much better than any non-democratic regime in  these\n respects. \nIn substantive terms, it may be \nrea\nsonable to expect from democracy \na government that is attentive to the needs and demands of the people and is largely free of corruption. The record of democracies is not impressive on these two counts. Democracies often frustrate the needs of the people and often ignore the demands of a majority of its population. The routine tales of corruption are enough to convince us that democracy is not free of this evil. At the same time, there is nothing to show that non-democracies are less corrupt or more sensitive to the\n people. \nThere is one respect in which \ndemocratic government i\ns certainly \nbetter than its alternatives: demo-cratic government is legitimate government.

Evidence shows that in practice, many democracies did not fulfil this expectation. \nIf you consider all democracies \nand all dictatorships for the fifty years between 1950 and 2000, dictatorships have slightly higher rate of economic growth. The inability of democracy to achieve higher economic development worries us. But this alone cannot be reason to reject democracy. As you have already studied in economics, economic development depends on several factors: country’s population \nThe Rich Get Buff  size, global situation, cooperation \nfrom other countries, economic priorities adopted by the country, etc. However, the difference in the rates of economic development between less developed countries with dictatorships and democracies is negligible.

These debates cannot be resolved in a simple manner. But some debates about democracy can and should be resolved by referring to some facts and figures. The debate about the economic outcomes of democracy is one such debate. Over the years, many students of democracy have gathered careful evidence to see what the relationship of democracy with economic growth and economic inequalities is.

Even when a country achieves economic growth, will wealth be distributed in such a way that all citizens of the country will have a share and lead a better life? Is economic growth in democracies accompanied by increased inequalities among the people? Or do democracies lead to a just distribution of goods and opportunities?© Ares - Best of Latin America, Cagle Cartoons Inc. Democracies are based on political \nequality. All individuals have equal weight in electing representatives. Parallel to the process of bringing individuals into the political arena on an equal footing, we find growing economic inequalities. A small number of ultra-rich enjoy a highly disproportionate share of wealth and incomes. Not only that, their share in the total income of the country has been increasing. Those at the bottom of the society have very little to depend upon. Their incomes have been declining. Sometimes they find it difficult to meet their basic needs of life, such as food, clothing, house, education and health. \nIn actual life, democracies do \nnot appear to be very successful in reducing economic inequalities. In Class IX Economics textbook, you \nhave already studied about poverty in \nIndia. The poor constitute a large \nproportion of our voters and no  \nparty will like to lose their \nvotes. Yet democratically \nelected governments do not appear to be as keen to address the question of poverty as you would expect them to. The situation is much worse in some other countries. In Bangladesh, more than half of its population lives in poverty. People in several poor countries are now dependent on the rich countries even for food supplies.Voice of the Poor\nDemocracy is \na rule of the majority. The poor are in majority. So democracy must be a rule of the poor. How can this not be the case?\nChapter 5.indd   69 08-04-2022   12:36:55\n2024-25"

This is not harmony. Should we be happy about it?Do democracies lead to peaceful and \nharmonious life among citizens? It will be a fair expectation that democracy should produce a harmonious social life. We have seen in the earlier chapters how democracies accommodate various social divisions. We saw in the first chapter how Belgium has successfully negotiated differences among ethnic populations. Democracies usually develop a procedure to conduct their competition. This reduces the possibility of these tensions becoming explosive or violent.\nNo society can fully and \npermanently resolve conflicts among different groups. But we can certainly learn to respect these differences and we can also evolve mechanisms to negotiate the differences. Democracy is best suited to produce this outcome. Non-democratic regimes often turn a blind eye to or suppress \ninternal social differences. Ability to handle social differences, divisions and conflicts is thus a definite plus point of democratic regimes. But the example of Sri Lanka reminds us that a democracy must fulfil two conditions in order to achieve this outcome:\n\n It is necessary to\n understand \nthat democracy is not simply rule \nby majority opinion.  The majority always needs to work with the minority so that governments function to represent the general view. Majority and minority opinions are not permanent.\n\n It is also necessary that rule by \nm\najority does not become rule by \nmajority community in terms of \nreligion or race or linguistic group, etc.  Rule by majority means that in case of every decision or in case of \n© Manny Francisco - The Phillippines,  Cagle Cartoons Inc. \nChapter 5.indd   70 08-04-2022   12:36:56\n2024-25"

If someone is barred from \nbeing in majority on the basis of birth, then the democratic rule ceases to be accommodative for that person or group.\nDignity and freedom of the citizens\nDemocracy stands much superior \nto any other form of government in promoting dignity and freedom of the individual. Every individual wants to receive respect from fellow beings. Often conflicts arise among individuals because some feel that they are not treated with due respect. The passion for respect and freedom are the basis of democracy. Democracies throughout the world have recognised this, at least in principle. This has been achieved in various degrees in various \ndemocracies. For societies which have been built for long on the basis of subordination and domination, it is not a simple matter to recognise that all individuals are equal. \nTake the case of dignity of \nwomen. Most societies across the world were historically male dominated societies. Long struggles by women have created some sensitivity today that respect to and equal treatment of women are \nEnemies \nGreeting\n© Ares - Best of Latin America, Cagle Cartoons Inc. \nChapter 5.indd   71 08-04-2022   12:37:00\n2024-25"

But once the principle is recognised, it becomes easier for women to wage a struggle against what is now unacceptable legally and morally. In a non-democratic set up, this unacceptability would not have legal basis because the principle of individual freedom and dignity would not have the legal and moral force there. The same is true of caste inequalities. Democracy in India has strengthened the claims of the disadvantaged and discriminated castes for equal status and equal opportunity. There are instances still of caste-based inequalities and atrocities, but these lack the moral and legal foundations. Perhaps, it is the recognition that makes ordinary citizens value their democratic rights.\nExpectations from democracy \nalso function as the criteria for judging any democratic country. What is most distinctive about \ndemocracy is that its examination never gets over. As democracy passes one test, it produces another test. As people get some benefits of democracy, they ask for more and want to make democracy even better. That is why, when we ask people about the way democracy functions, they will always come up with more expectations, and many complaints. The fact that people are complaining is itself a testimony to the success of democracy: it shows that people have developed awareness and the ability to expect and to look critically at power holders and the high and the mighty. A public expression of dissatisfaction with democracy shows the success of the democratic project: it transforms people from the status of a subject into that of a citizen. Most individuals today believe that their vote makes a difference to the way the government is run and to their own self-interest.\nThe above cartoon and graph illustrate a point made in this section \n(Dignity and freedom of the citizens).

He lost his ration card and applied for a duplicate one in January 2004. He made several rounds to the local Food and Civil Supplies office for the next three months. But the clerks and officials would not even look at him, leave alone do his job or bother to tell him the status of his application. Ultimately, he filed an application under the Right to Information Act asking for the daily progress made on his application, names of the officials, who were supposed to act on his application and what action would be taken against these officials for their inaction. Within a week of filing application under the Right to Information Act, he was visited by an inspector from the Food Department, who informed him that the card had been made and he could collect it from the office. When Nannu went to collect his card next day, he was given a very warm treatment by the Food and Supply Officer (FSO), who is the head of a Circle. The FSO offered him tea and requested him to withdraw his application under the Right to Information, since his work had already been done.\n What does Nannu’s example show?
