If we look around, we observe people require different types of products and services to satisfy their needs. How do they buy them? They go to the market, either physical or electronic over internet, where they find variety of shops and sellers offering the required commodities and choose the best which they require. \nHave you ever wondered how do \nthese products and services are made available in the market. The necessity of supplying goods and services is done by different set of people engaged in various economic activities such as production, manufacturing and Imran, Manpreet, Joseph and Priyanka have been classmates in Class X. After \ntheir exams are over, they happen to meet at a common friend Ruchita’s house. Just when they were sharing their experiences of examination days, Ruchika’s father Raghuraj Chaudhary intervenes and asks about their well-being. He also enquires about their career plans. But none of them had a definite reply. Raghuraj who himself is a successful businessman tells them about business as a career opportunity. Joseph gets excited by the idea and says “yes, business is really good for making lots of money”. Raghuraj tells them that ‘there is a lot more to business than merely money’. Business activities lead to growth and development of any country, he added. He further tells them that the roots of business activities can be traced back to ancient times and how trading helps in the prosperity of the Indian subcontinent. Priyanka said that they have read about the Silk Route in their history textbooks. Raghuraj then gets busy with his day-to-day tasks. However, the four classmates begin raising questions. The conversation of the four classmates focused on how trading activities were conducted during ancient times. How far can the roots of trading activities be traced? Why was the Indian subcontinent referred to as ‘Swaran Bharat and Swaran Dweep’ by the then travellers to India? What made \nColumbus and Vasco da Gama undertake journeys to locate India? They decided to meet the commerce teacher of their school to find out answers to many such questions about the development, nature and purpose of business.\ndistribution and exchange so that the \nneeds and wants of customers are satisfied. Business is a major economic activity which is concerned with the production and sale of goods and \nservices required by people. Business \nis central to our lives. Although our \nlives are also influenced by many other \ninstitutions in modern society, such as \nschools, colleges, hospitals, political \nparties and religious bodies; business has a major influence on our daily lives. It, therefore, becomes important that we understand the concept, nature and purpose of business.\nBusiness starts with production \nand end with consumption. Making the finished products reach the consumer \ninvolves a series of steps. The work of \nproduction of goods is covered under \nChapter 1 .indd   3 13-01-2021   09:40:02\n2024-25"

In a nutshell we call them ‘Business’ which is a wider term and includes Industry, trade and commerce. \nECONOMIC \nACTIVITIESExchangeTRANSFER OF GOODS AND SERVICES\n(Monetary versus Barter)\nDIVISION OF INCOME \nAMONG FACTORS OF \nPRODUCTIONSATISFACTION \nOF NEEDS \nAND WANTSDistribution ConsumptionProduction or PurchaseThe goods were traded both \ninternally and to the foreign lands, which generated surplus income. As a result, the people were engaged in various economic activities such as agriculture and domestication of animals, weaving cotton, dyeing fabrics, making clay pots, utensils and handicrafts, sculpting, cottage industries, masonry, etc. Family based workshops [ karkhanas ], for \nmanufacturing, were important components of economic life. This money was channelised into further investment, and led to the dominant growth of indigenous banking system to finance the trading activities.\nAn example of it is the use of \nage old Hundi  and Chitties  (used in \nsouthern region). These were used as documents to facilitate transfer of money from one hand to another for trading activities. As an instrument of exchange it involved a contract which — (i) warrant the payment of money, the promise or order which is unconditional (ii) capable of change through transfer by valid negotiation.\nWhy there was a need to create an \nintangible form of exchange of money. It was so because travelling long distances either by land or sea involved risk of theft and robbery. Hundi which literally means ‘to collect’ was written in vernacular language and facilitated the safe transfer of money between parties and helped promotion of trading activities. \nThe emergence of credit transactions \nand availability of loans and advances enhanced commercial operations. The \n1.1.1  Role of Business in the \nDevelopment of Economy\nBusiness which includes trade and commerce have played a vital role since times memorial. You have studied in your earlier classes that our country, India, had a golden past and the trading activities had a significant contribution to its prosperity and gains. The archaeological evidences have shown that trading activities were the mainstay of the economy in ancient times which were carried out by both water and land routes. Silk route and maritime trade were quite prominent in transporting goods and commodities for trading purposes.\nChapter 1 .indd   4 13-01-2021   09:40:02\n2024-25"

Commercial and Industrial banks later evolved to finance trade and commerce and agricultural banks to provide both short and long-term loans to finance agriculturists.\nMany leading trade centres were \ndeveloped in ancient times for the import and export of goods, some of them being Patliputra, Peshawar, Taxila, Indraprastha, Mithila, Maduram, Surat, Ujjain, Kanchi, Mithila. Major exports items were Spices, wheat, sugar, indigo, opium, sesame oil, cotton,  parrot,  live animals and animal products, etc. Major imports were Horses, animal products, Chinese silks, linen, wine, gold, silver, copper, etc. There were all kinds of towns—port towns, manufacturing towns, mercantile towns, the sacred centres, and pilgrimage towns. Their existence is an index of prosperity of merchant communities and professional classes.\nBusiness activities led to the \ngrowth of different aids to trade such as transportation, banking, finance and communication which grew the prospects of trading activities. With the active contribution of Indian traders and other merchant communities, the Indian sub-continent was popularly called ‘Swaran Bhoomi and Swaran Deep’ in the writings of many travellers, such as Megasthenes, Faxian (FaHien), Hundi as practised by Indian Merchant Communities\nDhani-jog Darshani Payable to any person—no liability over who received payment.\nSah-jog Darshani Payable to a specific person, someone ‘respectable’.

Rising incomes, savings, investment opportunities, increased domestic consumption and younger population ensures growth for decades to come.

Discuss in class.weak financial system, inadequate infrastructure and high huge expenditure on defence, high fiscal deficits and continuous deficits in balance of payments were evident and international community’s confidence in India’s ability to manage its economy was severely affected. The balance of payment situation was precarious. As a result, India agreed to economic liberalisation in 1991.\nA three pronged approach of \nstabilisation, restructuring and globalisation of Indian economy was adopted to address the changes in economic and business scenario and its integration with global economy. Government of India announced major economic reform packages aimed at restoring the growth momentum in the economy. Major policy changes were effected since 1991 w.r.t., fiscal, monetary, trade, industry, agriculture, infrastructure, foreign exchange and foreign investment since 1991. \n1.2 C onCepT  of Business\nThe term business is derived from \nthe word ‘busy’. Thus, business \nmeans being busy. However, in a specific sense, business refers to an occupation in which people regularly engage in activities related to purchase, production and/or sale of goods and services with a view to earning profits. \nIf you look around you will observe \nthat people undertake various activities to satisfy their needs. These activities may be broadly classified into two groups — economic and non-economic activities.

Business may be defined as an economic activity involving the production and sale of goods and services undertaken with a motive of earning profit by satisfying human needs in society.activities are performed out of love, \nsympathy, sentiment, patriotism, etc. For example, a worker working \nin a factory, a doctor operating in his clinic, a manager working in an office and a teacher teaching in a school are doing so to earn their livelihoods and are, therefore, engaged in an economic activity. On the other hand, a housewife cooking food for her family, or a boy helping an old man cross the road are performing non-economic activities since they are doing so out of love or sympathy. \nEconomic activities may be \nfurther divided into three categories, \nActivity\nBarter system is an old method of \nexchange of goods and/or services for another set of goods and/or services.

It may be mentioned here that this \nChapter 1 .indd   9 13-01-2021   09:40:07\n2024-25"

Thus, every business enterprise either manufactures the goods it deals in or acquires them from producers, to be further sold to consumers or users. Goods may consist of consumable items of daily use, such as sugar, ghee, pen, notebook, etc., or capital goods, like machinery, furniture, etc. Services may include facilities offered to consumers, business firms and organisations in the form of transportation, banking, electricity, etc.\n (iii) Sale or exchange of goods and \nservices:  Directly or indirectly, \nbusiness involves transfer or exchange of goods and services for value. If goods are produced not for the purpose of sale but for personal consumption, it cannot be called a business activity. Cooking food at home for the family is not business, but cooking food and selling it to others in a restaurant is business. Thus, one essential characteristic of business is that there should be sale or exchange of goods or services between the seller and the buyer.\n (iv) Dealings in goods and services \non a regular basis:  Business \ninvolves dealings in goods or services on a regular basis. One single transaction of sale or purchase, therefore, does not constitute business. Thus, for example, if a person sells his/her domestic radio set even at a profit, it will not be considered a business activity. But if he/she sells radio sets regularly either through a shop or from his/her residence, it will be regarded as a business activity.\n (v)\t Profit \tearning:  One of the main \npurpose of business is to earn income by way of profit. No business can survive for long without profit. That is why, businessmen make all possible efforts to maximise profits, by increasing the volume of sales or reducing costs.\n (vi) Uncertainty of return:  Uncertainty \nof return refers to the lack of knowledge relating to the amount of money that the business is going to earn in a given period. Every business invests money (capital) to run its activities with the objective of earning profit. But it is not certain as to what amount of profit will be earned. Also, there is always a possibility of losses being incurred, despite \nChapter 1 .indd   10 13-01-2021   09:40:07\n2024-25"

It is caused by some unfavourable or undesirable event. Risks are related with factors, like changes in consumer taste and fashion, changes in method of production, strike or lockout at workplace, increased competition in market, fire, theft, accidents, natural calamities, etc. No business can altogether do away with risks.\n1.2.3 Comparison of Business, \nProfession and Employment\nAs has been mentioned earlier, economic activities may be divided into three major categories viz., Business, Profession and Employment.

Industry is concerned with the production or processing of goods and materials. Commerce includes all those activities, which are necessary for facilitating the exchange of goods and services. On the basis of these two categories, we may classify business firms into industrial and commercial enterprises. Let us examine in detail the activities relating to business.\n1.3.1 Industry\nIndustry refers to economic activities, \nwhich are connected with conversion of resources into useful goods. Generally, the term industry is used for activities in which mechanical appliances and technical skills are involved. These include activities relating to producing or processing of goods, as well as, breeding and raising of animals. \nThe term industry is also used to mean groups of firms producing similar or related goods. For example, cotton textile industry refers to all manufacturing units producing textile goods from cotton. Similarly, electronic industry would include all firms producing electronic goods, and so on. Further, in common parlance, certain services, like banking and insurance, are also referred to as industry, say banking industry, insurance industry, etc. Industries may be divided into three broad categories namely primary, secondary and tertiary.\n (i) Primary industries: These \ninclude all those activities which are concerned with the extraction and production of natural resources and reproduction and development of living organisms, plants, etc. These are divided as follows.\n (a) Extractive industries:  \nThese industries extract \nChapter 1 .indd   12 13-01-2021   09:40:07\n2024-25"

Extractive industries supply some basic raw materials that are mostly products of geographical or natural environment. Products of these industries are usually transformed into many other useful goods by manufacturing industries. Important extractive  industries include farming, mining, lumbering, hunting and fishing operations.\n (b) Genetic industries:  These \nindustries are engaged in breeding plants and animals for their use in further reproduction. Seeds and nursery companies are typical examples of genetic industries. In additional, activities of cattle breeding farms, poultry farms, and fish hatchery come under genetic industries.\n (ii) Secondary industri es: These are \nconcerned with using materials, which have already been extracted at the primary sector. These industries process such materials to produce goods for final consumption or for further processing by other industrial units. For example, mining of iron ore is a primary industry, but manufacturing of steel by way of further processing of raw irons is a secondary industry. Secondary industries may be further divided as follows: (a) Manufacturing industries: \nThese industries are engaged \nin producing goods through processing of raw materials and, thus, creating form utilities. They bring out diverse finished products, that we consume, or use through the conversion of raw materials or partly finished materials in their manufacturing operations. Manufacturing industries may be further divided into four categories on the basis of method of operation for production.\n• Analytical industry which analyses and separates different elements from the same materials, as in the case of oil refinery.\n• Synthetical industry which combines various ingredients into a new product, as in the case of cement.\n• Processing industry which involves successive stages for manufacturing finished products, as in the case of sugar and paper.\n• Assembling industry which assembles different component parts to make a new product, as in the case of television, car, computer, etc.\n (b) Construction industries: \nThese industries are involved \nChapter 1 .indd   13 13-01-2021   09:40:07\n2024-25"

Engineering and architectural skills are an important part in construction industries.\n (iii) Tertiary industries:  These are \nconcerned with providing support services to primary and secondary industries as well as activities relating to trade. These industries provide service facilities. As business activities, these may be considered part of commerce because as auxiliaries to trade these activities assist trade. Included in this category are transport, banking, insurance, warehousing, communication, packaging and advertising.1.3.2 Commerce\nCommerce includes two types of \nactivities, viz., (i) trade and (ii) auxiliaries to trade. Buying and selling of goods is termed as trade. But there are a lot of activities that are required to facilitate the purchase and sale of goods. These are called services or auxiliaries to trade and include transport, banking, insurance, communication, advertisement, packaging and warehousing. Commerce, therefore, includes both, buying and selling of goods, i.e., trade, as well as, auxiliaries, such as transport, banking, etc.\nCommerce provides the necessary \nlink between producers and consumers. It embraces all those activities, which are necessary for maintaining a free flow of goods and \nChart Showing Business Activities\nChapter 1 .indd   14 13-01-2021   09:40:07\n2024-25"

The hindrances may be in respect of persons, place, time, risk, finance, etc. The hindrance of persons is removed by trade, thereby, making goods available to consumers from the possession or ownership producers. Transport removes the hindrances of place by moving goods from the place of production to the markets for sale. Storage and warehousing activities remove the hindrance of time by facilitating holding of stocks of goods to be sold as and when required. Goods held in stock, as well as, goods in course of transport are subject to a risk of loss or damage due to theft, fire, accidents, etc. Protection against these risks is provided by insurance of goods. Capital required to undertake the above activities is provided by banking and financing institutions. Advertising makes it possible for producers and traders to inform consumers about the goods and services available in the market. Hence, commerce is said to consist of activities of removing the hindrances of persons, place, time, risk, finance and information in the process of exchange of goods and services.\n1.3.3 Trade and Auxiliaries to Trade\nTrade is an essential part of commerce. \nIt refers to sale, transfer or exchange of goods either physical or virtual. It helps in making the goods produced available to the consumers or users. These days’ goods are produced on a large scale and it is difficult for \nproducers to themselves reach out to individual buyers for selling their products. Businessmen are engaged in trading activities to make the goods available to consumers in different markets. In the absence of trade, it would not be possible to undertake production activities on a large scale.\nActivities which are meant for \nassisting trade are known as auxiliaries to trade. These activities are generally referred to as services because these are in the nature of facilitating the activities relating to industry and trade. Transport, banking, insurance, warehousing, and advertising are regarded as auxiliaries to trade, i.e., activities playing a supportive role. In fact, these activities support not only trade, but also industry and, hence, the entire business activity. Auxiliaries are an integral part of commerce in particular and business activity in general. These activities help in removing various hindrances which arise in connection with the production and distribution of goods. Transport facilitates movement of goods from one place to another. Banking provides financial assistance to the manufacturer and trader. Insurance covers various kinds of business risks. Warehousing creates time utility by way of storage facilities. Advertising provides information to the consumers. In other words, these activities facilitate movement, storage, financing, risk coverage and sales promotion of goods. Auxiliaries to trade are briefly discussed below:\nChapter 1 .indd   15 13-01-2021   09:40:07\n2024-25"

For instance, tea is mainly produced in Assam; cotton in Gujarat and Maharashtra; jute in West Bengal and Odisha; sugar in U.P., Bihar and Maharashtra and so on. But these goods are required for consumption in different parts of the country. The obstacle of place is removed by transport through road, rail or coastal shipping. Transport facilitates movement of raw material, to the place of production and the finished products from factories to the place of consumption. Along with transport facility, there is also a need for communication facilities so that producers, traders and consumers may exchange information with one another. Thus, postal services and telephone facilities may also be regarded as auxiliaries to business activities.\n (ii) Banking and Fi nance:  Business \nactivities cannot be undertaken unless funds are available for acquiring assets, purchasing raw materials and meeting other expenses. Necessary funds can be obtained by businessmen from a bank. Thus, banking helps business activities to overcome the problem of finance. Commercial banks, generally lend money by providing overdraft and cash credit facilities, loans and advances. Banks also undertake collection of cheques, \nremittance of funds to different places, and discounting of bills on behalf of traders. In foreign trade, commercial banks help exporters in collecting money from importers. Commercial banks also help promoters of companies to raise capital from the public.\n (iii) Insurance:  Business involves \nvarious types of risks. Factory building, machinery, furniture, etc., must be protected against fire, theft and other risks. Material and goods help in stock or in transit are subject to the risk of loss or damage. Employees are also required to be protected against the risks of accident and occupational hazards. Insurance provides protection in all such cases. On payment of a nominal premium, the amount of loss or damage and compensation for injury, if any, can be recovered from the insurance company.\n (iv) Warehousing:  Usually, goods are \nnot sold or consumed immediately after production. They are held in stock to make them available as and when required. Special arrangement must be made for the storage of goods to prevent loss or damage. Warehousing helps business firms to overcome the problem of storage and facilitates the availability of goods when needed. Prices are, thereby, maintained at a reasonable level \nChapter 1 .indd   16 13-01-2021   09:40:07\n2024-25"

Both advertisement and PR activities are the tools to commerce, influence and promote your product, services or an idea to you potential customers and motivate you target customers to recognise your accomplishments. \n   Advertising and public \nrelation activities are one of the most important methods of promoting the sale of products and services in a market place. It  is practically impossible for producers and traders to contact each and every customer. Thus, for promoting sales, information in made available through advertisements and publicity tools about their features, price, etc., to the potential customers. Also, there is a need to persuade potential customer’s and buyers about the utility featuress, quality, price, competitive information about the goods and services, etc. The publicity of such attributes of products and services are done using various techniques of maintaining public relation tools. The popular PR tool is the use of press release in print and social media platforms. Advertising and Public Relations activities helps in providing information about available goods and services \nand inducing customers to buy particular items. Advertisements are always a paid activity where business occupies space in print or non-print media to promote its product or a service. PR activities, on the other hand, are normally unpaid where business enters into a strategic communication to build a mutually beneficial relationship.\n1.4 o BjeCTives  of Business\nAn objective is the starting point of \nbusiness. Every business is directed to the achievement of certain objectives. Objectives refer to all that the business people want to get in return for what they do. It is generally believed that business activity is carried out only for profit. Business persons themselves proclaim that their primary objective is produce or distribute goods or services for profit. Every business is said to be an attempt on the part of business people to get more than what has been spent or invested, or in other words, to earn profit which is the excess of revenue over cost. However, it is being increasingly realised nowadays that business enterprises are part of the society and need to fulfil several objectives, including social responsibility, to survive and prosper in the long run. Profit is found to be a leading objective but not the only one.\nAlthough earning profit cannot \nbe the only objective of business, its \nChapter 1 .indd   17 13-01-2021   09:40:08\n2024-25"

Profit may be regarded as an essential objective of business for various reasons: (i) it is a source of income for business persons, (ii) it can be a source of finance for meeting expansion requirements of business, (iii) it indicates the efficient working of business, (iv) it can be taken as the society’s approval of the utility of business, and (v) it builds the reputation of a business enterprise.\nHowever, too much emphasis \non profit to the exclusion of other objectives can be dangerous for good business. Obsessed with profit, business managers may neglect all other responsibilities towards customers, employees, investors and society at large. They may even be inclined to exploit various sections of society to earn immediate profit. This may result in the non-cooperation or even opposition from the affected people against the malpractices of business enterprises. The enterprises might lose business and may be unable to earn profit. This is essential for its own survival and prosperity.1.5 o BjeCTives  of Business\nObjectives are needed in every area that \ninfluences the survival and prosperity \nof business. Since a business has to balance a number of needs and goals, it requires multiple objectives. It cannot follow only one objective and expect to achieve excellence. Objectives have to be specific in every area and sphere of business. Objectives also enable the business to analyse their own performance and take steps as necessary to improve their performance in future. Some of these areas are described as follows.\n (i) Market standing: Marinating \ngoodwill and reputation of ones’ business is paramount to succeed and prosper. It helps in forming a distinct identity in the market and is referred to as market standing in relation to its competitors. A business enterprise must aim at standing on stronger footing in terms of offering competitive products at reasonable prices to its customers and serving them to their satisfaction.\n (ii) Innovation: Innovation is central \nto the growth of any business enterprise. It helps business to scale up and give competitive edge to the enterprise in the market. Innovation is defined as an introduction of new ideas or methods in the way something is done or made. However, it does not imply that a new product is to be manufactured. Any \nActivity\nWhen a business person conceptualises \nand starts a business; runs it, scales it up then why ‘maximising business profit is not a sole objective of business? Discuss in your class.

There are two kinds of innovation in every business, i.e., (i) innovation in product or services; and (ii) innovation in various skills and activities needed to supply products and services. No business enterprise can flourish in a competitive world without innovation. Therefore, innovation becomes an important objective.\n (iii) Productivit y: Productivity is \nascertained by comparing the value of output with the value of inputs. It is used as a measure of efficiency. In order to ensure continuous survival and progress, every enterprise must aim at greater productivity through the best use of available resources.\n ( i v ) Physical and financial  \nresources: Any business \nrequires physical resources, like plants, machines, offices, etc., and financial resources, i.e., funds to be able to produce and supply goods and services to its customers. The business enterprise must aim at acquiring these resources according to their requirements and use them \nefficiently.\n (v) Earning profits:  One of the \nobjectives of business is to earn profits on the capital employed. Profitability refers to profit in relation to capital investment. Every business must earn a reasonable profit which is so important for its survival and \ngrowth.\n (vi) Social responsibility:  Social \nresponsibility refers to the obligation of business firms to contribute resources for solving social problems and work in a socially desirable manner.\n1.6 B usiness  risk\nThe term ‘business risk’ refers to \nthe possibility of inadequate profits or even losses due to uncertainties or unexpected events. For example, demand for a particular product may decline due to change in tastes and preferences of consumers or due to increased competition from other producers. Lower demand results in long sales and profits. In another situation, the shortage of raw materials in the market may shoot up its price. The firm using these raw materials will have to pay more for buying them. As a result, cost of production may increase which, in turn, may reduce profits.\nBusiness enterprises constantly \nface two types of risk: speculative and pure. Speculative risks involve both the possibility of gain, as well as, the possibility of loss. Speculative risks arise due to changes in market conditions, including fluctuations in demand and supply, changes in prices or changes in fashion and tastes of customers. Favourable market conditions are likely to result in gains, whereas, unfavourable ones may result in losses. Pure risks involve only the possibility of loss or \nChapter 1 .indd   19 13-01-2021   09:40:08\n2024-25"

Their occurrence may result in loss, whereas, non-occurrence may explain absence of loss, instead of gain.\n1.6.1 Nature of Business Risks\nNature of business risks can be \nunderstood in terms of their peculiar characteristics:\n (i) Risk is an essential part of \nevery business: Every business has some risk. No business can avoid risk, although the amount of risk may vary from business to business. Risk can be minimised, but cannot be eliminated.\n (ii) Business risks arise due to \nuncertainties: Uncertainty refers \nto the lack of knowledge about what is going to happen in future. Natural calamities, change in demand and prices, changes in government policies and prices, improvement in technology, etc., are some of the examples of uncertainty which create risks for business because the outcomes of these future events are not known.\n (iii) Degree of risk depends mainly \nupon the nature and size of business: Nature of business \n(i.e., type of goods and services produced and sold) and size of business (i.e., volume of production and sale) are the main factors which determine the amount of risk in a business. For example, a business dealing \nin fashionable items has a high degree of risk. Similarly, a large-scale business generally has a higher risk than what a small scale has.\n (iv) Profit is the reward for risk \ntaking: ‘No risk, no gain’ is an \nage-old principle which applies to all types of business. Greater the risk involved in a business, higher is the chance of profit. An entrepreneur undertakes risks under the expectation of higher profit. Profit is thus the reward for risk taking.\n1.6.2 Cause of Business Risks\nBusiness risks arise due to a variety of \ncauses, which are classified as follows:\n (i) Natural causes: Human beings \nhave little control over natural calamities, like flood, earthquake, lightning, heavy rains, famine, etc., property and income in business.\n (ii) Human causes: Human causes \ninclude such unexpected events, like dishonesty, carelessness or negligence of employees, stoppage of work due to power failure, strikes, riots, management inefficiency, etc.\n (iii) Economic causes: These \ninclude uncertainties relating to demand for goods, competition, price, collection of dues from customers, change of technology or method of production, etc. \nChapter 1 .indd   20 13-01-2021   09:40:08\n2024-25"

The process of setting up one’s own business is called entrepreneurship. The person who set-up his business is called an entrepreneur. The output of the process, that is, the business unit is called a business enterprise. It is interesting to note that entrepreneurship besides providing self-employment to the entrepreneur is responsible to a great extent for creation and expansion of opportunities for the other two economic activities too that is, employment and profession. And, in the process, business entrepreneurship becomes crucial for overall economic development of a nation.\nWhen you make this choice, you \nbecome a job-provider rather than a job-seeker, besides enjoying a host of other financial and psychological rewards. Taking to entrepreneurship by starting \none’s own business is a matter of aspiring to become an entrepreneur. It is  defined as ‘a systematic, purposeful and creative activity of identifying a need, mobilising resources and organising production with a view to delivering value to the customers, returns for the investors and profits for the self in accordance with the risks and uncertainties associated with business’. This definition points to factors need to be considered for starting the business. Starting and managing one’s business does not emerge spontaneously. Rather, it is the outcome of interaction between a person and business environment. The choice of being an entrepreneur lies with an individual. In this regard, it becomes imperative to look at both—factors in the environment, as well as, factors in the individual’s perception of desirability and feasibility.\n (i) Selection of type of business: \nThe first thing to be decided by an entrepreneur is the nature and type of business to be undertaken. He/she will obviously like to enter that branch of industry and commerce, which has the possibility of greater amount of profits. The decision will be influenced by the customer requirements in the market and also the kind of technical knowledge and interest the entrepreneur has for producing a particular product.\nChapter 1 .indd   21 13-01-2021   09:40:08\n2024-25"

Whether the business is for MSME sector or a large scale enterprise. Whether it will operate for manufacturing or tertiary sector. Some factors favour a large size, whereas, others tend to restrict the scale of operation. If the entrepreneur is confident that the demand for the proposed product is likely to be good over time and he/she can arrange the necessary capital for business, he/she can start the operation at a large scale. \n(iii) Location of business enterprise: \nAn important factor to be considered at the start of the business is the place where the enterprise will be located. Any mistake in this regard can result in high cost of production, inconvenience in getting, right kind of production inputs or serving the customers in the best possible way. Availability of raw materials and labour; power supply and services, like banking, transportation, communication, warehousing, etc., are important factors while making a choice of location.\n (iv) Financing the proposition: \nFinancing is concerned with providing the necessary  capital for starting, as well as, for continuing the proposed business. Capital is required \nfor investment in fixed assets, like land, building, machinery and equipment and in current assets, like raw materials, books, debts, stock of finished goods, etc. Capital is also required for meeting day-to-day expenses. \n (v) Physical facilities: Availability \nof physical facilities, including machines and equipment, building and supportive services is an important factor to be considered at the start of the business. The decision relating to this factor will depend on the nature and size of business, availability of funds and the process of production.\n (vi) Competent and committed \nworked force: Every enterprise needs competent and committed workforce to perform various activities so that physical and financial resources are converted into desired outputs. Since no individual entrepreneur can do everything himself, he/she must identify the requirement of skilled and unskilled workers and managerial staff. Plans should also be made about how the employees will be trained and motivated to give their best performance.\n (vii) Tax planning: Tax planning has \nbecome necessary these days because there are a number of tax laws in the country and they influence almost every aspect \nChapter 1 .indd   22 13-01-2021   09:40:08\n2024-25"

The entrepreneur has to consider in advance the tax liability under various tax laws and its impact on business decisions.\n (viii) Launching the enterprise: After \nthe decisions relating to the above mentioned factors have been taken, the entrepreneur can go ahead with actual launching of the enterprise which would mean mobilising various resources, fulfilling necessary legal formalities, starting the production process and initiating the sales promotion campaign. A business enterprise can be a sole proprietor firm, a partnership firm or a company for which proper financial planning must be done to determine (a) the requirement of capital, (b) source from where the capital will be raised and (c) the best ways of utilising the capital in the firm.\nEXERCISES\nShort Answer Questions\n1.

Nestled in the beautiful district of Assam is the district of Kamrup. In Kamrup, lies a small, tight knit community village called Sualkuchi. Sualkuchi is known for its silk weavers and the intricate art of silk weaving. There is a part of silk weaving called weft insertion or buta weaving. This requires complete attention, dedication and precision. The slow process is mentally and physically exhausting. It slows down productivity and leads to the workers being unable to take extra work. In this community of the quiet workers lived Dipak Bharali. Born in a simple family, he knew the weaving occupation was going to be his livelihood. The resourceful young man wanted to be a success and achieve something substantial.  He purchased a silk weaving loom and started a business with it. The venture was growing and income was quite good. Yet, something bothered Dipak. To expand the business of silk weaving, there was no other option but to keep purchasing more looms. He tried to find other means of investment and progress. The simple minded villagers told him just to increase the number of looms. Dipak \nChapter 1 .indd   24 13-01-2021   09:40:08\n2024-25"

He thought he could make a machine that will automate the process of weft insertion or buta weaving.\n4. One fine day, Dipak and his brother were reminiscing about their childhood. A good part of their childhood had revolved around creating fun games out of simple objects and ideas. He remembered his brother trying to make an electro-magnet by using some wires and nails. Another game involved placing a safety pin or nail on paper and moved using a magnet below the paper. Like the proverbial light bulb going on in somebody’s mind, Dipak’s brain was triggered by this memory. \n5. He knew this was the push he needed to create a solution for his dilemma. Now that he had the idea, he had to create the device. An entrepreneur is one who succeeds despite failing numerous times. After a mind boggling 80 tries, he developed the ideal device ‘Chaneki’. ‘Chaneki’ is made of recyclable materials, making not only a useful but an eco-friendly invention. The device made machine to run 40 times faster than manual weft insertion of motifs! Several weavers have now mastered Chaneki and increased output majorly. This difference has allowed productivity and quality to increase, pleasing both the owners and weavers. \n6. It is always easy to walk the path taken by everybody.

Hardly any legal formalities are required to start a sole proprietary business, though in some cases one may require a license. Closure of the business can also be done easily. Thus, there is ease in formation as well as closure of business.\n(ii) Liability:  Sole proprietors have \nunlimited liability.

However, if the business is successful, the proprietor enjoys \nall\tthe\tbenefits. \tHe\treceives \tall\tthe\t\nbusiness \tprofits\twhich\tbecome\ta\tdirect\t\nreward for his risk bearing.\n(iv) Control:  The right to run the \nbusiness and make all decisions lies absolutely with the sole proprietor. He can carry out his plans without any interference from others.\nChapter 2.indd   28 13-01-2021   09:40:59\n2024-25"

He gradually sold portions of his business \nto various partners and, just prior to his death in 1888, sold his remaining interest in Coca-Cola to Asa G. Candler. An Atlantan with great business acumen,  \nMr. Candler proceeded to buy additional business rights and acquire complete control. \nOn May 1, 1889, Asa Candler published a full-page advertisement in The Atlanta \nJournal, proclaiming his wholesale and retail drug business as “sole proprietors of Coca-Cola ... Delicious. Refreshing. Exhilarating. Invigorating.”  Sole \nownership, which Mr. Candler did not actually achieve until 1891, needed an \ninvestment \tof\t$\t2,300.\nIt was only in 1892 that Mr. Candler formed a company called The Coca-Cola Corporation.\nSource: Website of Coca Cola company. (v) No separate entity:  In the eyes of \nthe law, no distinction is made between \nthe sole trader and his business, as business does not have an identity separate from the owner. The owner is, therefore, held responsible for all the activities of the business.\n(vi) Lack of business continuity:  The \nsale proprietorship business is owned and controlled by one person, therefore death, insanity, imprisonment, physical ailment or bankruptcy of the sole proprietor will have a direct and detrimental effect on the business and may even cause closure of the business.\nMerits\nSole proprietorship offers many advantages. Some of the important ones are as follows:(i) Quick decision making:  A sole \nproprietor enjoys considerable degree \nof freedom in making business decisions. Further the decision making is prompt because there is no need to consult others. This may lead to timely capitalisation of market opportunities as and when they arise.\n(ii) Confidentiality  of information:  \nSole decision making authority \nenables the proprietor to keep all the information related to business \noperations \tconfidential \tand\tmaintain \t\nsecrecy. A sole trader is also not bound \nby\tlaw\tto\tpublish\tfirm’s\taccounts.\n(iii) Direct incentive:  A sole proprietor \ndirectly\treaps\tthe\tbenefits \tof\this/her\t\nefforts as he/she is the sole recipient \nof\tall\tthe\tprofit.\tThe\tneed\tto\tshare\t\nprofits\tdoes\tnot\tarise\tas\the/she\tis\tthe\t\nChapter 2.indd   29 13-01-2021   09:40:59\n2024-25"

This provides maximum \nincentive to the sole trader to work hard. \n(iv) Sense of accomplishment:  There \nis a personal satisfaction involved in working for oneself. The knowledge that one is responsible for the success of the business not only contributes to self-satisfaction but also instils in the individual a sense of accomplishment \nand\tconfidence \tin\tone’s\tabilities.\n(v) Ease of formation and closure:  An \nimportant merit of sole proprietorship is the possibility of entering into business with minimal legal formalities. There is no separate law that governs sole proprietorship. As sole proprietorship is the least regulated form of business, it is easy to start and close the business as per the wish of the owner.\nLimitations\nNot with standing various advantages, \nthe sole proprietorship form of organisation is not free from limitations. Some of the major limitations of sole proprietorship are as follows:\n(i) Limited resources: \tResources \tof\t\na sole proprietor are limited to his/\nher personal savings and borrowings from others. Banks and other lending institutions may hesitate to extend a long term loan to a sole proprietor. Lack of resources is one of the major reasons why the size of the business rarely grows much and generally remains small.(ii) Limited life of a business \nconcern:  The sole proprietorship \nbusiness is owned and controlled \nby one person, so death, insanity, imprisonment, physical ailment or bankruptcy of a proprietor affects the business and can lead to its closure.\n(iii) Unlimited liability:  A major \ndisadvantage of sole proprietorship is \nthat the owner has unlimited liability. If the business fails, the creditors can recover their dues not merely from the business assets, but also from the personal assets of the proprietor. A  \npoor decision or an unfavourable circumstance can create serious \nfinancial \tburden\ton\tthe\towner.\tThat\tis\t\nwhy a sole proprietor is less inclined to take risks in the form of innovation  \nor expansion.\n(iv) Limited managerial ability:  The \nowner has to assume the responsibility of varied managerial tasks such as \npurchasing, \tselling,\tfinancing, \tetc.\tIt\tis\t\nrare\tto\tfind\tan\tindividual \twho\texcels\tin\t\nall these areas. Thus decision making \nmay not be balanced in all the cases. Also, due to limited resources, sole proprietor may not be able to employ \nand retain talented and ambitious employees.\nThough sole proprietorship suffers \nfrom various shortcomings, many entrepreneurs opt for this form of organisation because of its inherent advantages. It requires less amount of capital. It is best suited for businesses which are carried out on a small scale and where customers demand personalised services.\nChapter 2.indd   30 13-01-2021   09:40:59\n2024-25"

In 1850, Samuel Lowell Price set up his accounting business in London. In 1865, he was joined in partnership by William H. Holyland and Edwin Waterhouse. As the firm grew, qualified members of its professional staff were admitted to the partnership. By the late 1800s, Price Waterhouse had gained \nsignificant recognition as an accounting firm.

The partners enjoy the right to participate in the management of the firm and their acts are binding on each other as well as on the firm. Registration of the firm is optional. The existence of the firm is affected by the death, lunacy, insolvency or retirement of the partners.\n(ii)\n Limited Partnership: In limited\n \npartnership, the liability of at least \none partner is unlimited whereas the rest may have limited liability. Such a partnership does not get terminated with the death, lunacy or insolvency of the limited partners. The limited partners do not enjoy the right of management and their acts do not bind the firm or the other partners. Registration of such partnership is compulsory.This form of partnership was \nnot permitted in India earlier. The \npermission to form partnership firms with limited liability has been granted after introduction of New Small Enterprise Policy in 1991. The idea behind such a move has been to enable the partnership firms to attract equity capital from friends and relatives of small scale entrepreneurs who were earlier reluctant to help, due to the existence of unlimited liability clause in the partnership form of business.\n2.4.3\n Partnership Deed\nA partnership \nis a voluntary association \nof people who come together for \nachieving common objectives. In order to enter into partnership, a clear agreement with respect to the terms, conditions and all aspects concerning the partners is essential so that there is no misunderstanding later among the partners. Such an agreement can be oral or written. Even though it is not essential to have a written agreement, it is advisable to have a written agreement as it constitutes an evidence of the conditions agreed upon.

H. Calvert\nCooperative organisation is “a society which has its objectives for the promotion of economic interests of its members in accordance with cooperative principles.\nThe Indian Cooperative Societies Act 1912\n2.5   c ooPerative  society  \nThe word cooperative means working \ntogether and with others for a common purpose. \nThe cooperative society is a \nvoluntary association of persons, who join together with the motive of welfare of the members. They are driven by the need to protect their economic interests in the face of possible exploitation at the hands of middlemen obsessed with \nthe\tdesire\tto\tearn\tgreater\tprofits.\nThe cooperative society is \ncompulsorily required to be registered under the Cooperative Societies Act 1912. The process of setting up a cooperative society is simple enough and at the most what is required is the consent of at least ten adult persons to form a society. The capital of a society is raised from its members through issue of shares. The society acquires a distinct legal identity after its registration.\nFeatures\nThe characteristics of a cooperative \nsociety are listed below.\n(i) Voluntary membership:  The \nmembership of a cooperative society \nis voluntary. A person is free to join a cooperative society, and can also leave anytime as per his desire. There cannot be any compulsion for him to join or quit a society. Although procedurally a member is required to serve a notice before leaving the society, there is no compulsion to remain a member. Membership is open to all, irrespective \nof their religion, caste, and gender. \n(ii) Legal status: \tRegistration \tof\ta\t\ncooperative society is compulsory. \nThis accords a separate identity to the society which is distinct from its members. The society can enter into contracts and hold property in its name, sue and be sued by others. As a result of being a separate legal entity, it is not affected by the entry or exit of its members.\n(iii) Limited liability:  The liability of \nthe members of a cooperative society is limited to the extent of the amount contributed by them as capital. This defines the maximum risk that a \nmember can be asked to bear.\n(iv) Control:  In a cooperative society, \nthe power to take decisions lies in \nthe hands of an elected managing committee. The right to vote gives the members a chance to choose the members who will constitute the \nChapter 2.indd   40 13-01-2021   09:41:00\n2024-25"

Hence, the motive of service dominates its working. If any surplus is generated as a result of its operations, it is distributed amongst the members as dividend in conformity with the bye-laws of the society.\nMerits\nThe cooperative society offers many \nbenefits \tto\tits\tmembers. \tSome\tof\tthe\t\nadvantages of the cooperative form of \norganisation are as follows.\n(i) Equality in voting status:   The \nprinciple of ‘one man one vote’ governs the cooperative society. Irrespective of the amount of capital contribution by a member, each member is entitled to equal voting rights.\n(ii) Limited liability:  The liability of \nmembers of a cooperative society is limited to the extent of their capital contribution. The personal assets of the members are, therefore, safe from being used to repay business debts.\n(iii) Stable existence:  Death, \nbankruptcy or insanity of the members do not affect continuity of a cooperative society. A society, therefore, operates unaffected by any change in the membership.\n(iv) Economy in operations:  The \nmembers generally offer honorary services to the society. As the focus \nis on elimination of middlemen, this helps in reducing costs. The customers or producers themselves are members of the society, and hence the risk of bad debts is lower. \n(v) Support from government:  The \ncooperative \tsociety\texemplifies \tthe\tidea\t\nof\tdemocracy \tand\thence\tfinds\tsupport \t\nfrom the Government in the form of low taxes, subsidies, and low interest rates on loans.\n(vi) Ease of formation:  The cooperative \nsociety can be started with a minimum of ten members. The registration procedure is simple involving a few legal formalities. Its formation is governed by the provisions of Cooperative \nSocieties Act 1912. \nLimitations\nThe cooperative form of organisation \nsuffers from the following limitations:\n(i) Limited resources: \tResources \tof\ta\t\ncooperative society consists of capital \ncontributions of the members with limited means. The low rate of dividend offered on investment also acts as a deterrent in attracting membership or more capital from the members.\n(\nii) Inefficiency in management:  \nCooperative societies are unable to \nattract and employ expert managers because of their inability to pay them high salaries. The members who offer honorary services on a voluntary basis are generally not professionally equipped to handle the management functions effectively.\nChapter 2.indd   41 13-01-2021   09:41:00\n2024-25"

It is, therefore, called an \nartificial \tperson.\n(ii) Separate legal entity:  From the \nday of its incorporation, a company acquires an identity, distinct from its members.

The risk of loss thus gets spread over a large number of shareholders.\nMerits\nThe company form of organisation \noffers a multitude of advantages, some of which are discussed below.\n(i) Limited liability:  The shareholders \nare liable to the extent of the amount unpaid on the shares held by them. \nAlso, only the assets of the company \ncan be used to settle the debts, leaving the owner’s personal property free from any charge. This reduces the degree of risk borne by an investor.\n(ii) Transfer of interest:  The ease \nof transfer of ownership adds to the advantage of investing in a company as the share of a public limited company can be sold in the market and as such \ncan be easily converted into cash in case the need arises. This avoids blockage of investment and presents the company as a favourable avenue for investment purposes.\n(iii) Perpetual existence:  Existence of \na company is not affected by the death, retirement, resignation, insolvency or insanity of its members as it has a separate entity from its members. A company will continue to exist even if all the members die. It can be liquidated only as per the provisions \nof\tthe\tCompanies \tAct,\t2013.\n(iv) Scope for expansion:  As \ncompared to the sole proprietorship and \npartnership forms of organisation, a \ncompany \thas\tlarge\tfinancial \tresources. \t\nFurther, capital can be attracted from the public as well as through loans from \nbanks\tand\tfinancial \tinstitut ions.\tThus\t\nthere is greater scope for expansion. The investors are inclined to invest in shares because of the limited liability, transferable ownership and possibility of high returns in a company.\n(v) Professional management:  \nA company can afford to pay higher salaries to specialists and professionals. It can, therefore, employ people who are experts in their area of specialisations. The scale of operations in a company leads to division of work. Each department deals with a particular activity and is headed by an expert. This leads to balanced decision \nmaking\tas\twell\tas\tgreater\tefficiency \tin\t\nthe company’s operations.\nChapter 2.indd   46 13-01-2021   09:41:00\n2024-25"

As compared to sole proprietorship and partnership form of organisations, formation of a company is more complex.\n(ii) Lack of secrecy:  The Companies \nAct requires each public company to provide from time-to-time a lot of \ninformation \tto\tthe\toffice\tof\tthe\tregistrar \t\nof companies. Such information is available to the general public also. \nIt\tis,\ttherefore, \tdifficult \tto\tmaintain \t\ncomplete secrecy about the operations of company.\n(iii) Impersonal work environment:  \nSeparation of ownership and management leads to situations in which there is lack of effort as well as personal involvement on the \npart\tof\tthe\tofficers \tof\ta\tcompany. \t\nThe large size of a company further makes it difficult for the owners and top management to maintain personal contact with the employees, customers and creditors. \n(iv) Numerous regulations:  The \nfunctioning of a company is subject to many legal provisions and compulsions. A company is burdened with numerous restrictions in respect of aspects including audit, voting, \nfiling\tof\treports\tand\tpreparation \tof\t\ndocuments, and is required to obtain various certificates from different \nagencies, viz., registrar, SEBI, etc. This reduces the freedom of operations of a company and takes away a lot of time, effort and money.\n(v) Delay in decision making: \nCompanies are democratically managed through the Board of Directors which is followed by the top management, middle management and lower level management. Communication as well as approval of various proposals may cause delays not only in taking decisions but also in acting upon them.  \n(vi) Oligarchic management:  In \ntheory, a company is a democratic institution wherein the Board of Directors are representatives of the shareholders who are the owners. In practice, however, in most large sized organisations having a multitude of shareholders; the owners have minimal influence in terms of controlling or running the business. It is so because the shareholders are spread all over the country and a very small percentage attend the general meetings. The Board of Directors as such enjoy considerable freedom in exercising their power which they sometimes use even contrary to the interests of the shareholders. \nDissatisfied \tshareholders \tin\tsuch\ta\t\nsituation have no option but to sell their shares and exit the company. As the directors virtually enjoy the rights to take all major decisions, it leads to rule by a few. \nChapter 2.indd   47 13-01-2021   09:41:00\n2024-25"

These demands pose problems in managing the company as it often becomes difficult to satisfy such diverse interests.\n2.6.1  Types of Companies \nA company can be either a private or \na public company. These two types of companies are discussed in detail in \nthe following paragraphs.\nPrivate Company\nA private company means a company \nwhich: \n (a) restri cts the right of members to \ntransfer its shares; (b) has a minimum of 2 and a maximum \nof\t200\tmembers, \texcluding \tthe\t\npresent and past employees;\n (c) does not invite public to subscribe \nto its s ecurities and  \nIt is necessary for a private company \nto use the word private limited  after its \nname.

A private company can be formed \nby only two members whereas seven people are needed to form a public company.\n2. There is no need to issue a pro -\nspectus as public is not invited to subscribe to the shares of a pri-vate company.\n3. Allotment of shares can be done \nwithout receiving the minimum subscription.

It, therefore, becomes vital that certain basic considerations are kept in mind while choosing an appropriate form of organisation. The important factors determining the choice of organisation are listed in Table 2.4 and are discussed as follows:\nTable 2.4     Factors  influencing  the choice of \n       form of Business Organisation\nForm of organisation\nFactor Most advantageous Least advantageous\nAvailability of capital Company Sole proprietorship\nCost of formation Sole proprietorship Company\nEase of formation Sole proprietorship Company\nTransfer of ownership Company (except private company) Partnership\nManagerial skills Company Sole proprietorship\nRegulations Sole proprietorship Company\nFlexibility Sole proprietorship Company\nContinuity Company Sole proprietorship\nLiability Company Sole proprietorship\nChapter 2.indd   49 13-01-2021   09:41:00\n2024-25"

                "text": "50\nBUSINESS   STUDIES\n(i) Cost and ease in setting up the \norganisation:  As far as initial business \nsetting-up costs are concerned, sole \nproprietorship is the most inexpensive way of starting a business. However, the legal requirements are minimum and the scale of operations is small. In case of partnership also, the advantage of less legal formalities and lower cost is there because of limited scale of operations. Cooperative societies and companies have to be compulsorily registered. Formation of a company involves a lengthy and expensive legal procedure. From the point of view of initial cost, therefore, sole proprietorship is the preferred form as it involves least expenditure. Company form of organisation, on the other hand, is more complex and involves greater costs. \n(\nii) Liability:  In case of sole \nproprietorship \tand\tpartnership \tfirms,\t\nthe liability of the owners/partners \nis unlimited. This may call for paying the debt from personal assets of the owners. In joint Hindu family business, only the karta has unlimited \nliability. In cooperative societies and companies, however, liability is limited and creditors can force payment of their claims only to the extent of the company’s assets. Hence, from the point of view of investors, the company form of organisation is more suitable \nas the risk involved is limited.\n(iii) Continuity:  The continuity of sole \nproprietorship \tand\tpartnership \tfirms\tis affected by such events as death, \ninsolvency or insanity of the owners. However, such factors do not affect the continuity of business in the case of organisations like joint Hindu family business, cooperative societies and companies. In case the business needs a permanent structure, company form is more suitable. For short term ventures, proprietorship or partnership may be preferred.\n(iv) Management ability:  A sole \nproprietor may find it difficult to \nhave expertise in all functional areas of management. In other forms of organisations like partnership and company, there is no such problem. Division of work among the members in such organisations allows the managers to specialise in specific areas, leading to better decision making. But this may lead to situations \nof\tconflicts \tbecause \tof\tdifferences \tof\t\nopinion amongst people. Further, if the organisation’s operations are complex in nature and require professionalised management, company form of organisation is a better alternative. Proprietorship or partnership may be suitable, where simplicity of operations allow even people with limited skills to run the business. Thus, the nature of operations and the need for professionalised management affect \nthe choice of the form of organisation.\n(v) Capital considerations:  Companies \nare in a better position to collect \nlarge amounts of capital by issuing shares to a large number of investors. \nChapter 2.indd   50 13-01-2021   09:41:00\n2024-25"

Thus, if the scale of operations is large, company form may be suitable whereas for medium and small sized business one can opt for partnership or sole proprietorship. Further, from the point of view of expansion, a company is more suitable because of its capability to raise more funds and invest in expansion plans. It is precisely for this purpose that in our opening case Neha’s father suggested she should consider switching over to the company form of organisation. \n(vi) Degree of control:  If direct \ncontrol over operations and absolute \ndecision making power is required, proprietorship may be preferred. But if the owners do not mind sharing control and decision making, partnership or company form of organisation can be adopted. The added advantage in the case of company form of organisation is that there is complete separation of ownership and management and it is  professionals who are appointed to independently manage the affairs of  \na company.(vii) Nature of business:  If direct \npersonal contact is needed with the \ncustomers such as in the case of a grocery store, proprietorship may be more suitable. For large manufacturing units, however, when direct personal contact with the customer is not required, the company form of organisation may be adopted. Similarly, in cases where services of a professional nature are required, partnership form is much \nmore suitable. \nIt would not be out of place to \nmention here that the factors stated above are inter-related. Factors like capital contribution and risk vary with the size and nature of business, and hence a form of business organisation that is suitable from the point of view of the risks for a given business when run on a small scale might not be  appropriate when the same business is carried on a large scale. It is, therefore, suggested that all the relevant factors must be taken into consideration while making a decision with respect to the form of organisation that should be adopted.\nKey Terms\nSole proprietorship  Partnership  Joint Hindu Family\nMutual agency  Cooperative Societies  Joint Stock Company\nPerpetual \tsuccession\t Artificial \tperson\t Holding \tcompany \t\nCo-parceners  Incorporation of a Company   \n \nChapter 2.indd   52 13-01-2021   09:41:00\n2024-25"

The major forms of organisation include proprietorship, partnership, joint Hindu family business, cooperative society and company.\nSole proprietorship refers to a form of organisation where business is owned, \nmanaged and controlled by a single individual who bears all the risks and is \nthe\tonly\trecipient \tof\tall\tthe\tprofits.\tMerits\tof\tthis\tform\tof\torganisation \tinclude\t\nquick decision making, direct incentive, personal satisfaction, and ease of formation and closure.

Karta\n — the oldest male member of the family  — controls the business. The \nstrong points of joint Hindu family business include effective control, stability in existence, limited liability and increased loyalty among family members. But this form of organisation too suffers from certain limitations such as limited resources, lack of incentives, dominance of the karta and limited managerial ability.\nA cooperative society  is a voluntary association of persons who get together to \nprotect their economic interests. The major advantages of a cooperative society \nare equality in voting, members’ limited liability, stable existence, economy in operations, support from government, and ease of formation. But this form of \norganisation \tsuffers\tfrom\tweaknesses \tsuch\tas\tlimited\tresources, \tinefficiency \t\nin management, lack of secrecy, government control, and differences among members in regard to the way society should be managed and organised. Based on their purpose and nature of members, various types of societies that can be formed include: consumers cooperative society, producers cooperative society, marketing cooperative society, farmers cooperative society, credit cooperative society, and cooperative housing society.\nChapter 2.indd   53 13-01-2021   09:41:00\n2024-25"

In your neighbourhood market, there are shops owned by sole proprietors or big retail organisations run by a company. Then there are people providing you services like legal services, medical services, being owned by more than one person i.e., partnership firms. These are all privately owned organisations. Similarly, there are other offices or places of business which may be owned by the government. For example, Railways is an organisation wholly owned and managed by the government. The post office, in your locality is owned by the Post and Telegraph Department, Government of India, though our dependence on their postal services, particularly in cities and towns has been greatly  reduced. This is because of plenty of private courier services firms operating in bigger towns. Then there are businesses which operate in more than one country known as global enterprises. Therefore, you may have observed that all types of organisations are doing business in the country whether they are public, private or global.\n3.2 PrIvate Sector  and PublIc \nSector\nThe private sector consists of \nbusiness owned by individuals or a group of individuals, as you have  \nlearnt in the previous chapter. The various forms of organisation are  \nsole proprietorship, partnership,  \njoint Hindu family, cooperative  \nand company.Anita, a student of Class XI, was going through some newspapers. The headlines stared at her face, Government plans to disinvest its shares in a few companies. The next day there was another news item on one public sector company incurring heavy losses and the proposal for closing the same. In contrast to this, she read another item on how some of the companies under the private sector were doing so well. She was actually curious to know what these terms like public sector, disinvestment, privatisation meant.\nShe learnt there are all kinds of business organisation-small or large, industrial \nor trading, privately owned or government owned existing in our country. These organisations affect our daily economic life and therefore become part of the Indian economy. Since the Indian economy consists of both privately owned and government owned business enterprises, it is known as a mixed economy. The Government of India has opted for a mixed economy where both private and government enterprises are allowed to operate. The economy, therefore, may be classified into two sectors, viz., private sector and public sector. \nThen there are businesses which operate in more than one country known as \nglobal enterprises. Therefore, you may have observed that all types of organisations are doing business in the country whether they are public, private or global.\nChapter 3.indd   58 13-01-2021   11:15:54\n2024-25"

These organisations may either be partly or wholly owned by the central or state government. They may also be a part of the ministry or come into existence by a Special Act of the Parliament. The government, through these enterprises participates in the economic activities of the country.\nThe government in its industrial \npolicy resolutions, from time-to-\ntime,\tdefines\tthe\tarea\tof\tactivities \tin\t\nwhich the private sector and public sector are allowed to operate. In the Industrial Policy Resolution 1948, \nthe\tGovernment \tof\tIndia\thad\tspecified \t\nthe approach towards development of the industrial sector. The roles of the private and public sector were clearly \ndefined\tand\tthe\tgovernment \tthrough \t\nvarious Acts and Regulations was overseeing the economic activities of both the private and public sector. The Industrial Policy Resolution, 1956 \nhad\talso\tlaid\tdown\tcertain\tobjectives \t\nfor the public sector to follow so as to accelerate the rate of growth and industrialisation. The public sector was given a lot of importance but at the same time mutual dependency of public and private sectors was emphasised. The 1991 industrial policy was radically different from all the earlier policies where the government was deliberating disinvestment of public sector and allowing greater freedom to the private sector. At the same time, foreign direct investment was invited from business houses outside India. Thus, multinational corporations or global enterprises which operate in more than one country gained entry into the Indian economy. Thus, we have public sector units, private sector enterprises and global enterprises coexisting in the Indian economy.\n3.3 Forms oF orGanisin G Public \nsector  enterPrises\nGovernment’s participation in business \nand economic sectors of the country needs some kind of organisational framework to function. You have studied about the forms of business organisation in the private sector viz., sole proprietorship, partnership, \nHindu\tundivided \tfamily,\tcooperative \t\nand company.\nIn the public sector, as it grows, an \nimportant question arises in respect of \nhow it is to be organised or what form of organisation it should take.

These public enterprises are owned by the public and are accountable to the public through the Parliament. They are characterised by public \nChapter 3.indd   59 31-12-2020   11:54:45\n2024-25"

These enterprises are established as \ndepartments of the ministry and are \nconsidered part or an extension of the ministry itself. The Government functions through these departments and the activities performed by them are an integral part of the functioning of the government. They have not been constituted as autonomous or independent institutions and as such are not independent legal entities. They act through the officers of the Government and its employees are Government employees.

The main purpose of a government  \ncompany, registered like other companies, is defeated.\n3.4 c hanGinG role oF Public sector\nAt the time of Independence, it was \nexpected that the public sector enterprises would play an important \nrole\tin\tachieving \tcertain\tobjectives \tof\tthe\t\neconomy either by direct participation in business or by acting as a catalyst. The public sector would build up infrastructure for other sectors of the economy and invest in key areas. The private sector was unwilling to invest \nin\tprojects \twhich\trequired \theavy\t\ninvestment and had long gestation periods. The government then took it upon itself to develop infrastructural facilities and provide for goods and services essential for the economy.\nThe Indian economy is in a stage \nof transition. The Five Year Plans in the initial stages of development gave lot of importance to the public sector. In the post–1990s, the new economic policies, emphasised on liberalisation, privatisation and globalisation. The role\tof\tpublic\tsector\twas\tredefined. \tIt\t\nwas not supposed to play a passive role \nbut to actively participate and compete in the market with other private sector companies in the same industry. They were also held accountable for losses and return on investment. If a public sector was making losses continuously, it was referred to the Board for Industrial and Financial Reconstruction (BIFR) for complete overhauling or shut down. Various committees were set up to study the working of inefficient public sector units with reports on how to \nimprove \ttheir\tmanagerial \tefficiency \t\nand\tprofitability. \tThe\trole\tof\tpublic\t\nsector is definitely not what was envisaged in the early 1960s or 70s.\n(i) Development of infrastructure:  \nThe development of infrastructure is a prerequisite for industrialisation in any country. In the pre-Independence period, basic infrastructure was not developed and therefore, industrialisation progressed at a very slow pace. The process of industrialisation cannot  \nbe sustained without adequate transportation and communication facilities, fuel and energy, and basic and heavy industries. The private sector did not show any initiative to invest in heavy industries or develop it in any manner. They did not have trained personnel or finances to immediately establish heavy industries which was the requirement of the economy.\nIt was only the government which \ncould mobilise huge capital, coordinate \nChapter 3.indd   65 31-12-2020   11:54:46\n2024-25"

Rail, road, sea and air transport was the responsibility of the government, and their expansion has contributed to the pace of industrialisation and ensured future economic growth. The public sector enterprises were to operate in certain spheres. Investments were to be made to:\n (a) Give infrastructure to the core \nsector, which requires huge capital investment, complex and upgraded technology, big and effective organisation structures like steel plants, power generation plants, civil aviation, railways, petroleum, state trading, coal, etc;\n (b) Give a lead in investment to the \ncore sector where private sector enterprises are not functioning in the desired direction, like fertilizers, pharmaceuticals, petro-chemicals, newsprint, medium and heavy engineering;\n (c) Give direction to future \ninvestments \tlike\thotels,\tproject\t\nmanagement, consultancies, textiles, auto-mobiles, etc.\n(ii) Regional balance:  The government \nis responsible for developing all regions and states in a balanced way and removing regional disparties. Most of the industrial progress was limited to a few areas like the port towns in the pre-Independence period. After 1951, the government laid down in its Five Year Plans, that particular attention would be paid to those regions which were lagging behind and public sector industries were deliberately set up. \nFour\tmajor\tsteel\tplants\twere\tset\tup\t\nin the backward areas to accelerate economic development, provide employment to the workforce and develop ancilliary industries. This was achieved to some extent but there is scope for a lot more. Development of backward regions so as to ensure a regional balance in the country is \none\tof\tthe\tmajor\tobjectives \tof\tplanned \t\ndevelopment. Therefore, the govern-ment had to locate new enterprises in backward areas and at the same time prevent the mushrooming growth of private sector units in already advanced areas.\n(iii) Economies of scale:  Where \nlarge scale industries are required to be set up with huge capital outlay, the public sector had to step in to take advantage of economies of scale. Electric power plants, natural gas, petroleum and telephone industries are some examples of the public sector setting up large scale units. These units required a larger base to function economically which was only possible with government resources and mass scale production.\n(iv) Check over concentration of \neconomic power:  The public sector \nacts as a check over the private sector. In the private sector there are very few industrial houses which would be willing to invest in heavy industries with the result that wealth gets concentrated in a few hands and monopolostic practices are encouraged. This gives rise to inequalities in income, which is detrimental to society.\nChapter 3.indd   66 31-12-2020   11:54:46\n2024-25"

This prevents concentration of wealth and economic power in the private sector.\n(v) Import substitution:  During the \nsecond and third Five Year Plan period, \nIndia was aiming to be self-reliant in many spheres. Obtaining foreign exchange was also a problem and it \nwas\tdifficult\tto\timport\theavy\tmachinery \t\nrequired for a strong industrial base. At that time, public sector companies involved in heavy engineering which would help in import substitution were established. Simultaneously, several public sector companies like STC and MMTC have played an important role in expanding exports of the country.\n(vi) Government policy towards \nthe public sector since 1991:  The \nGovernment of India had introduced \nfour\tmajor\treforms\tin\tthe\tpublic\tsector\t\nin its new industrial policy in 1991. The main elements of the Government policy are as follows:\n•\tRestructure and revive potentially \nviable PSUs\n•\tClose down PSUs, which cannot be revived\n•\tBring down governments equity in all non-strategic PSUs to 26 per cent or lower, if necessary; and\n•\tFully protect the interest of workers.\n (a) Reduction in the number of \nindustries reserved for the public sector from 17 to 8 \n(and then to 3):  In the 1956 \nresolution on Industrial policy, 17 industries were reserved for the public sector. In 1991, only  \n8 industries were reserved for  \nthe public sector, they were restricted to atomic energy, arms and communication, mining, and railways. In 2001, only three industries were reserved exclusively for the public sector. These are atomic energy, arms and rail transport. This meant that the private sector could enter all areas (except the three) and the public sector would hav e to \ncompete with them.\nThe public sector has played a \nvital role in the development of the \neconomy. \tHowev er,\tthe\tprivate\tsector\t\nis also quite capable of contributing substantially to the nation building process. Therefore, both the public sector and the private sector need to be viewed as mutually complementary parts of the national sector. Private sector units also have to assume greater public responsibilities. Simultaneously, the public sector needs to focus on achieving more in a highly competitive market.\n (b) Disinvestment of shares of  \na select set of public sector \nenterprises: Disinvestment \ninvolves the sale of the equity shares to the private sector and \nthe\tpublic.\tThe\tobjective \twas\tto\t\nraise resources and encourage wider participation of the general \nChapter 3.indd   67 31-12-2020   11:54:46\n2024-25"

The government had taken a decision to withdraw from the industrial sector and reduce its equity in all  undertakings. \nIt was expected that this would \nlead to improving managerial performance and ensuring financial discipline. But there remains a lot to be done in  \nthis area.\nThe\tprimary \tobjectives \tof\tprivatising \t\npublic sector enterprises are:\n•\tReleasing the large amount of public resources locked up in non-strategic Public Sector Enterprises (PSEs), so that they may be utilised on other social priority areas such as basic health, family welfare and primary education.\n•\tReducing the huge amount of public debt and interest burden;\n•\tTransferring the commercial risk to the private sector so that the funds are invested in able projects;\n•\tFreeing these enterprises from government control and introduction of corporate governance; and\n•\tIn many areas where the public sector had a monopoly, for example, telecom sector the consumers have benefitted by more choices, lower prices and better quality of products and services.\n (c) Policy regarding sick units \nto be the same as that for the private sector:  All public \nsector units were referred to the \nBoard of Industrial and Financial Reconstruction to decide whether a sick unit was to be restructured or closed down. The Board has reconsidered revival and rehabilitation schemes for some cases and winding up for a numb er of units. There \nis a lot of resentment amongst \nworkers of the units which are \nto be closed down. A National Renewal Fund was set up by the government to retrain or redeploy retrenched labour and to provide compensation to public sector employees seeking voluntary retirement.\n   There are many enterprises \nwhich are sick and not capable of being revived as they have accumulated huge losses. With public finances under intense pressure, both central and state \ngovernment \tare\tjust\tnot\table\t\nto sustain them much longer. The only option available to the government in such cases is to close down these undertakings after providing a safety net for the employees and workers.

In the last 2 decades or so. MNCs have played an important role in the Indian economy. They have become a common feature of most developing economies in the world. MNCs as is evident from what we see around us, are gigantic corporations which have their operations in a number of countries. They are characterised by their huge size, large number of products, advanced technology, marketing strategies and network of operations all over the world. Global enterprises thus are huge industrial organisations which extend their industrial and marketing operations through a network of their branches in several countries.  These enterprises operate in several areas producing multiple products with their business strategy extending over a number of countries. \nThey\tdo\tnot\taim\tat\tmaximising \tprofits\t\nfrom one or two products but instead spread their branches all over.  Features\nThese corporations have distinct \nfeatures which distinguish them from other private sector companies, public sector companies and public sector enterprises. These are as follows:\n(i) Huge capital resources:  These \nenterprises are characterised by \npossessing \thuge\tfinancial \tresources \t\nand the ability to raise funds from \ndifferent sources. They are able to tap funds from various sources. They may issue equity shares, debentures or bonds to the public. They are also \nin\ta\tposition \tto\tborrow\tfrom\tfinancial \t\ninstitutions and international banks. \nThey\tenjoy\tcredibility \tin\tthe\tcapital\t\nmarket. Even investors and banks of the host country are willing to invest \nin\tthem.\tBecause \tof\ttheir\tfinancial \t\nstrength they are able to survive under all circumstances.\n(ii) Foreign collaboration:  Global \nenterprises usually enter into agreements with Indian companies pertaining to the sale of technology, production of goods, use of brand \nnames\tfor\tthe\tfinal\tproducts, \tetc.\tThese\t\nMNCs may collaborate with companies in the public and private sector. There are usually various restrictive clauses in the agreement relating to transfer  \nof technology, pricing, dividend payments, tight control by foreign technicians, etc. Big industrial houses wanting to diversify and expand have gained by collaborating with MNCs in terms of patents, resources, foreign exchange etc. But at the same time these foreign collaborations have given rise to the growth of monopolies and \nconcentration of power in few hands.\nChapter 3.indd   69 31-12-2020   11:54:46\n2024-25"

Qualitative research requires huge investment which only global enterprises can afford.\n(v) Marketing strategies:  The \nmarketing strategies of global companies are far more effective than other companies. They use aggressive marketing strategies in order to increase their sales in a short period. They posses a more reliable and up-to-date market information system. Their advertising and sales promotion techniques are normally very effective. Since they already have carved out a place for themselves in the global market, and their brands are well-known, selling their products is not a problem.\n(vi) Expansion of market territory:  \nTheir operations and activities extend \nbeyond the physical boundaries of their own countries. Their international image also builds up and their market \nterritory expands enabling them to become international brands. They  operate through a network of \nsubsidiaries, \tbranches \tand\taffiliates \t\nin host countries. Due to their giant \nsize they occupy a dominant position in the market.\n(vii) Centralised control: They have \ntheir headquaters in their home country and exercise control over all \nbranches \tand\tsubsidiaries. \tHowever, \t\nthis control is limited to the broad policy framework of the parent company. There is no interference in day-to-day operations.\n3.6 Joint ventures\nMeaning\nBusiness organisations as you have studied earlier can be of various types private or government owned or global enterprises.

For example, when foreign companies form joint venture companies in India they gain access to the vast Indian market. Their products which have reached saturation point in their home markets can be easily sold in new markets. \nThey can also take advantage of \nthe established distribution channels i.e., the retail outlets in different local markets. Otherwise, establishing their own retail outlets may prove to be  \nvery expensive.\n(iii) Access to technology: Technology \nis a major factor for most businesses to enter into joint ventures. Advanced techniques of production leading to superior quality products saves a lot of time, energy and investment as they do not have to develop their own technology. Technology also adds to efficiency and effectiveness, thus leading to reduction in costs.\n(iv) Innovation:  The markets  \nare increasingly becoming more demanding in terms of new and innovative products. Joint ventures allow business to come up with something new and creative for  \nthe same market. Specially foreign partners  can come up with innovative products because of new ideas and \ntechnology.\n(v) Low cost of production:  When \ninternational corporations invest in \nIndia, they benefit immensely due to the lower cost of production. They are able to get quality products for their global requirements. India is becoming an important global source and extremely competitive in many products.\nThere are many reasons for this, \nlow cost of raw materials and labour, technically qualified workforce; management professionals, excellent manpower in different cadres, like lawyers, chartered accountants, engineers, scientists. The international partner thus, gets the products of required quality and specifications at a much lower cost than what is prevailing in the home country. \n(vi) Established brand name:  When \ntwo businesses enter into a joint venture, one of the parties benefits from the other’s goodwill which has already been established in the market. If the joint venture is in India and with an Indian company, the Indian company does not have to spend time or money in developing a brand name for the product or even a distribution system. There is a ready market waiting for the product to be launched. A lot of investment is saved in the process.\n3.7 P ublic Private  Partnershi P (PPP)\nThe Public Private Partnership model \nallocates tasks, obligations and risks among the public and private partners in an optimal manner.

These organisations affect our \ndaily economic life and therefore, become part of the Indian economy. The government of India has opted for a mixed economy, where both private and government enterprises are allowed to operate. The economy, therefore, may \nbe\tclassified \tinto\ttwo\tsectors\tviz.,\tprivate\tsector\tand\tpublic\tsector.\tThe\tprivate\t\nsector consists of business owned by individuals or a group of individuals. \nVarious \tforms\tof\torganisation \tare\tsole\tproprietorship, \tpartnership, \tjoint\t\nHindu\tfamily,\tcooperative \tand\tcompany. \tThe\tpublic\tsector\tconsists \tof\tvarious\t\norganisations owned and managed by the government. These organisations may either be partly or wholly owned by the central or state government.\nForms of organising public sector enterprises: Government’s participation \nin business and economic sectors of the country needs some kind of organisational framework to function. A public enterprise may take any particular form of organisation depending upon the nature of it’s operations and their relationship with the government. The suitability of a particular form of organisation would depend upon its requirements. The forms of organisation which a public enterprise may take are as follows:\n (i) Departmental undertaking\n (ii)  Statutory corporation\n (iii) Government company\nDepartmental undertakings: These enterprises are established as departments of the ministry and are considered part or an extension of the ministry itself. The Government functions through these departments and the activities performed by them are an integral part of the functioning of the government.\nStatutory corporations:  Statutory corporations are public enterprises \nbrought \tinto\texistence \tby\ta\tSpecial\tAct\tof\tthe\tParliament. \tThe\tAct\tdefines\tits\t\npowers and functions, rules and regulations governing its employees and its \nChapter 3.indd   75 13-01-2021   09:41:21\n2024-25"

The Indian economy is in a stage of transition.  \nIn the post 90’s period, the new economic policies emphasised liberalisation, \nprivatisation \tand\tglobalisation. \tThe\trole\tof\tthe\tpublic\tsector\twas\tredefined. \t\nIt was not supposed to play a passive role but to actively participate  \nand compete in the market with other private sector companies in the  \nsame industry.Development of infrastructure:  The process of industrialisation cannot be \nsustained without adequate transportation and communication facilities, fuel \nand energy, and basic and heavy industries. It is only the government which could mobilise huge capital, coordinate industrial construction and train technicians and workforce.\nRegional balance: The government is responsible for developing all regions \nand states in a balanced way and removing regional disparties. Development of backward regions so as to ensure a regional balance in the country is one of \nthe\tmajor\tobjectives \tof\tplanned \tdevelopment. \tTherefore, \tthe\tgovernment \thad\t\nto locate new enterprises in backward areas and at the same time prevent the mushrooming growth of private sector unit in already advanced areas.\nEconomies of scale: Where large scale industries are required to be set up \nwith huge capital outlay, the public sector had to step in to take advantage of economies of scale.\nCheck over concentration of economic power:  The public sector acts as a \ncheck over the private sector. In the private sector there are very few industrial \nhouses which would be willing to invest in heavy industries with the result that wealth gets concentrated in a few hands and monopolostic practices are encouraged.\nImport substitution: During the second and third Five Year Plan period, \nIndia was aiming to be self-reliant in many spheres. Public sector companies involved in heavy engineering which would help in import substitution were established.\nChapter 3.indd   76 31-12-2020   11:54:46\n2024-25"

Let us examine \nfew examples of business activity i.e., \npurchasing ice cream from a store \nand eating ice cream in a restaurant, \nwatching a movie in a cinema hall \npurchasing a school bus and leasing \nit from a transporter. If you analyse \nall these activities, you will observe \nthat there is a difference between \npurchasing and eating, purchasing \nand watching and purchasing and \nleasing. What is common in all of them \nis that one is purchasing an item and \nthe other is  experiencing a service. But \nthere\tis\tdefinitely \ta\tdifference \tbetween \tthe item or good and the service \nperformed.\nFor a layperson, services are \nessentially intangibles. Their purchase does not result in the ownership of anything physical. For example, you can only seek advice from the doctor, you cannot purchase him. Services are all those economic activities that are intangible and imply an interaction to be realised between the service provider and the consumer.\nServices are those separately \nidentifiable, essentially intangible activities that provides satisfaction of wants, and are not necessarily linked to the sale of a product or another service.\nA good is a ph ysical product capable \nof being delivered to a purchaser and All of us have seen a petrol pump. Have your ever thought how a petrol pump \nowner does his business in a village? How he gets the petrol and diesel to the villages in the interior? How he gets the money to purchase large quantities of petrol and diesel? How he communicates to petrol depots for requirement and also to customers? How he safeguards himself from various risks associated with this business? The answer to all the above questions lies in the understanding \nof\tbusiness \tservices. \tThe\ttransportation \tof\tpetrol\tand\tdiesel\tfrom\toil\trefineries \tto\t\npetrol pumps is carried out by train and tankers (transport services).  They are then stored at various depots of oil companies situated in all major towns across India (warehousing services). Petrol pump owners use postal, mail and telephone facilities to be in touch with customers, banks and the depots for the availability of their requirements on regular basis (communication services). As oil companies always sell the petrol and diesel on advance payment, the owners have to take loans and advances from banks to fund their purchases (banking services). Petrol and diesel being highly risky products, the owners have to safeguard themselves from various risks by getting the business, the products, the life of people working there, etc., insure (insurance services). Thus, we see that a single business of providing petrol and diesel at a petrol pump is actually a collective outcome of various business services. These services are being utilised in the entire process \nof\tshipment \tof\tpetrol\tand\tdiesel\tfrom\toil\trefineries \tto\tthe\tpoint\tof\tsale\tat\tpetrol\t\npumps, spread across the length and breath of India.\nChapter 4.indd   80 31-12-2020   11:55:08\n2024-25"

Goods are also generally used to refer to commodities or items of all types, except services, involved in trade or commerce.\n4.2 n ature  of services\nThere\tare\tfive\tbasic\tfeatures \tof\tservic es.\t\nThese features also distinguish them from goods and are known as the \nfive\tIs\tof\tservices. \tThese\tare\tdiscussed \t\nas below:\n(i) Intangibility:  Services are \nintangible, i.e., they cannot be touched. They are experiential in nature. One cannot taste a doctor’s treatment, or touch entertainment. One can only experience it. An important implication of this is that quality of the offer can often not be determined before consumption and, therefore, purchase. It is, therefore, important for the service providers that they consciously work on creating a desired service so that the customer undergoes a favourable experience. For example,  \ntreatment by  a doctor should be a \nfavourable experience.\n(ii) Inconsistency:  The second \nimportant characteristic of services is inconsistency. Since there is no standard tangible product, services have to be performed exclusively each time. Different customers have different demands and expectations. Service providers need to have an opportunity to alter their offer to closely meet the requirements of the \ncustomers. This is happening, fo r \nexample, in the case of mobile services.(iii) Inseparability:     Another \nimportant characteristic of services \nis the simultaneous activity of production and consumption being performed. This makes the production and consumption of services seem to be inseparable. While we can manufacture a car today and sell it after, say, a month; this is often not possible with services that have to be consumed as and when they are produced. Service providers may design a substitute for the person by using appropriate technology but the interaction with the customer remains a key feature of services. Automated Teller Machines (ATMs) may replace \nthe\tbanking \tclerk\tfor\tthe\tfront\toffice\t\nactivities like cash withdrawal and cheque deposit. But, at the same time, the presence of the customer, is required and his/her interaction with the process has to be managed.\n(iv) Inventory (Less):  Services have \nlittle or no tangible components and, therefore, cannot be stored for a future use. That is, services are perishable and providers can, at best, store some associated goods but not the service itself. This means that the demand and supply needs to be managed as the service has to be performed as and when the customer asks for it. They cannot be performed earlier to be consumed at a later date. For example, a railway ticket can be stored but the railway journey will be experienced only when the railways provides it.\nChapter 4.indd   81 31-12-2020   11:55:08\n2024-25"

A customer has the opportunity to get the services modified according to \nspecific\trequirements.\n4.2.1  Difference between Services \nand Goods\nFrom the above, it is clear that the two main differentiating characteristics of services and goods are non- transferability of ownership and presence of both provider as well as consumer. While goods are produced, services are performed. A service is an act which cannot be taken home. What we can take home is the effect of the services. And as the services are sold at the consumption point, there \nare no inventories. On the basis of above features, we can have following  \npoints of distinction between goods  \nand services.\n4.3 t ypes of services\nWhen speaking of the service sector, \nservices \tcan\tbe\tclassified \tinto\tthree\t\nbroad categories, viz., business services, social services and personal services. These have been explained in the following pages.\n(i) Business Services:  Business \nservices are those services which are \nused by business enterprises for the conduct of their activities. For example, banking, insurance, transportation, warehousing  and communication services.\nBasis Services Goods\nNatureAn activity or process. e.g., \nwatching a movie in a cinema hallA physical object. e.g.,  \nvideo cassette of movie\nType Heterogeneous Homogenous\nIntangibility Intangible e.g., doctor treatment Tangible e.g., medicine\nInconsistencyDifferent customers having \ndifferent demands e.g., mobile \nservicesDifferent customers getting \nstandardised demands \nfulfilled. \te.g.,\tmobile\tphones\nInseparabilitySimultaneous production and \nconsumption. e.g., eating  \nice-cream in a restaurantSeparation of production and \nconsumption. e.g., purchasing  \nice cream from a store\nInventoryCannot be kept in stock. e.g., \nexperience of a train journeyCan be kept in stock. e.g., \ntrain journey ticket\nInvolvementParticipation of customers at the \ntime of service delivery. e.g.,  \nself-service in a fast food jointInvolvement at the time of \ndelivery not possible. e.g., \nmanufacturing a vehicleDifference between Services and Goods\nChapter 4.indd   82 31-12-2020   11:55:08\n2024-25"

These social goals may be to improve the standard of living for weaker sections of society, to provide educational services to their children, or to provide health care and hygienic conditions in slum areas. These services are usually provided voluntarily but for some consideration to cover their costs. For example, health care and education services provided by certain Non-government organisations (NGOs) and government agencies.\n(iii) Personal Services:  Personal \nservices are those services which are experienced differently by different customers. These services cannot be consistent in nature. They will differ depending upon the service provider. They will also depend upon customer’s preferences and demands. For example, tourism, recreational services, restaurants.\nIn the context of better  \nunderstanding of the business  \nworld, we will be limiting our  \nfurther\tdiscussions \tto\tthe\tfirst\tcategory \t\nof the service sector i.e., business services.\n4.3.1  Business Services\nToday’s world is of tough competition, \nwhere the survival of the fittest is the rule. There is no room for non-performance, and hence companies tend to stick to what they can do best. In order to be competitive, business enterprises, are becoming more and more dependant on specialised business services. Business enterprises \nlook towards banks for availabilit y \nof funds; insurance companies for \ngetting their plant, machinery, goods, etc., insured; transport companies for \ntransporting \traw\tmaterial ;\tand\tfinished \t\ngoods, and telecom and postal services \nfor being in touch with their vendors, \nsuppliers and customers. Today’s globalised world has ushered in a rapid change in the service industry in India. India has been gaining a highly competitive edge over other countries when it comes to providing services to the developed economies of the world. Many foreign companies are looking to India for performing a host of business services. They are even transferring a part of their business operations to be performed in India. We will discuss these in detail in the next chapter.\n4.4 Banking\nCommercial banks are an important \ninstitution of the economy for providing \ninstitutional credit to its customers. A banking company in India is the one which transacts the business of banking which means accepting, for the purpose of lending and investment of deposits of money from the public, repayable on demand or otherwise and withdrawable by cheques, draft, order or otherwise. In simple terms, a bank accepts money on deposits, repayable on demand and also earns \na\tmargin\tof\tprofit\tby\tlending\tmoney.\tA\t\nbank stimulates economic activity in the market by dealing in money.

These are governed by Indian Banking Regulation Act 1949 and according to it banking means accepting deposits of money from the public for the purpose of lending or investment. There are two types of commercial banks, public sector and private sector banks.are owned, managed and controlled \nby private promoters and they are free to operate as per market forces. There are a number of public sector banks like SBI, PNB, IOB etc., and other private sector banks represented by HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank and Jammu and Kashmir Bank.\n(ii) Cooperative Banks:  Cooperative \nBanks are governed by the provisions of State Cooperative Societies Act and meant essentially for providing cheap credit to their members. It is an important source of rural credit, i.e., \nagricultural \tfinancing \tin\tIndia.\n(iii) Specialised Banks:  Specialised \nbanks are foreign exchange banks, industrial banks, development banks, export-import banks catering to  \nspecific\tneeds\tof\tthese\tunique\tactivities. \t\nThese\tbanks\tprovide\tfinancial \taid\tto\t\nindustries, heavy  turnkey projects \nand foreign trade.Banking and Social Objectives\nIn the recent past there has been a concerted effort by the policy makers in reorienting banking towards achieving social objectives.

It also acts as a government  banker. It controls and coordinates currency and credit policies of any country. The Reserve Bank of India is the central bank of our country.\n4.4.2  Functions of Commercial  \nBanks\nBanks perform a variety of functions. Some of them are the basic or primary functions of a bank while others are agency or general utility services in nature. The important functions are \nbriefly\tdiscussed \tbelow:\n(i) Acceptance of deposits:  Deposits \nare the basis of the loan operations since banks are both borrowers and lenders of money. As borrowers they pay interest and as lenders they grant loans and get interest. These deposits are generally taken through current \naccount, \tsavings\taccount \tand\tfixed\t\ndeposits. Current account deposits can be withdrawn to the extent of the balance at any time without any prior notice.\nSavings accounts are for \nencouraging savings by individuals. \nBanks pay rate of interest as decided by RBI on these deposits. Withdrawal from these accounts has some restrictions in relation to the amount as well as number of times in a given period. Fixed accounts are time deposits with higher rate of interest as compared to the savings accounts. A premature withdrawal is permissible \nwith a percentage of interest being forfeited.\n(ii) Lending of f unds:  Second \nmajor activity of commercial banks \nis to provide loans and advances out of the money received through deposits. These advances can be made in the form of overdrafts, cash credits, discounting trade bills, term loans, consumer credits and other miscellaneous advances. The funds lent out by banks contribute a great deal to trade, industry, transport and other business activities.\n(iii) Cheque facility:  Banks render \na very important service to their customers by collecting their cheques drawn on other banks. The cheque is the most developed credit instrument, a unique feature and function of banks for the withdrawal of deposits. It is the most convenient and an inexpensive medium of exchange. There are two types of cheques mainly (a) bearer cheques, which are encashable immediately at bank counters and  \n(b) crossed cheques which are to be deposited only in the payees account.\n(iv) Remittance of funds:  Another \nsalient function of commercial banks is of providing the facility of fund transfer from one place to another, on account of the interconnectivity of branches. The transfer of funds is administered by using bank drafts, pay orders or mail transfers, on nominal commission charges. The bank issues a draft for the amount on its own branches at other places or other banks at those places. The payee can present the draft \nChapter 4.indd   85 31-12-2020   11:55:09\n2024-25"

They also perform other services like buying and selling of shares and debentures on instructions and other personal services like payment of insurance premium, collection of dividend etc.\n4.4.3  e-Banking\nThe growth of Internet and e-commerce \nis dramatically changing everyday  \nlife, with the world wide web and  \ne-commerce transforming the world into a digital global village. The latest wave in information technology is internet banking. It is a part of virtual banking and another delivery channel for customers.\nIn simple terms, Internet banking \nmeans any user with a PC and a \nbrowser can get connected to the banks website to perform any of the virtual banking functions and avail of any of the bank’s services. There is no human operator to respond to the needs of the customer. The bank has a centralised data base that is web-enabled. All the services that the bank has permitted on the internet are displayed on a menu. Any service can be selected and further interaction is dictated by the nature of service.\nIn this new digital market place \nbanks\tand\tfinancial \tinstitutions \thave\t\nstarted providing services over the internet. These type of services provided \nby the banks on the internet, called  \ne-banking, lowers the transaction cost, adds value to the banking relationship and empowers customers. e-banking is electronic banking or banking using electronic media. Thus, e-banking is a service provided by many banks, that allows, a customer to conduct banking transactions, such as managing savings, checking accounts, applying for loans or paying bills over the internet using a personal computer, mobile telephone or handheld computer (personal digital assistant) The range of services offered by e-banking are: Automated Teller Machines (ATM) and Point of Sales (PoS), Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) and Credit Cards Electronic or Digital cash and Electronic bank transfer (EFT). The two ways in which EFT can be done are: NEFT (National Electronic Fund Transfer) and RTGS (Real Time Gross Settlement).\nBenefits\nThere\tare\tvarious\tbenefits \tof\te-banking \t\nprovided to customers which are:\n (i) E-banking facilitates digital \npayments and promotes  \ntransparency in financial statements. \n   (ii) e-banking provides 24 hours,  \n365 days a year services to the customers of the bank;\n (iii) Customers can make some of the \npermitted \ttransactions \tfrom\toffice\t\nor house or while travelling  via mobile telephone;\nChapter 4.indd   86 31-12-2020   11:55:09\n2024-25"

The chances \nof occurrence of an event causing losses are quite uncertain. There are risks of \ndeath\tand\tdisability \tfor\thuman\tlife;\tfire\t\nand burglary risk for property; perils of the sea for shipment of goods and, so on. If any of these takes place, the individuals and/or, organisations may suffer a great loss, sometimes beyond their capacities to bear the same. It  \nis to minimise the impact of such uncertainties that there is a need for insurance. Investment in factory buildings or heavy equipments or other \nassets is not possible unless there is arrangement for covering the risks, with the help of insurance. Keeping this in mind, people facing common risks come together and make small contributions to a common fund, which helps to spread the loss caused to an individual by a particular risk over a number of persons who are \nexposed to it.\nInsurance is thus a device by \nwhich the loss likely to be caused by \nan uncertain event is spread over a number of persons who are exposed to it and who prepare to insure themselves against such an event. It is a contract or agreement under which one party agrees in return for a consideration to pay an agreed amount of money to another party to make a loss, damage or injury to something of value in which the insured has a pecuniary interest as a result of some uncertain event. The agreement/contract is put in writing and is known as ‘policy’. The person whose risk is \ninsured\tis\tcalled\t‘insured’ \tand\tthe\tfirm\t\nwhich insures the risk of loss is known \nas insurer/assurance underwriter.\n4.5.1  Fundamental principle of \nInsurance\nThe basic principle of insurance is that \nan individual or a business concern \nchooses \tto\tspend\ta\tdefinitely \tknown\t\nsum in place of a possible huge amount \ninvolved \tin\tan\tindefinite \tfuture\tloss.\t\nThus insurance is the substitution of a small periodic payment (premium) \nChapter 4.indd   88 31-12-2020   11:55:09\n2024-25"

                "text": "89\nBUSINESS SERVICES\nfor a risk of large possible loss. The \nloss of risk still remains but the loss is spread over a large number of policyholders exposed to the same risk. The premium paid by them are pooled out of which the loss sustained by any policy holder is compensated. Thus, risks are shared with others. From the analysis of past events the insurer (an insurance company or an underwriter) knows the probable losses caused by \neach type of risk covered by insurance. \nInsurance, therefore, is a form of \nrisk management primarily used to \nsafe guard against the risk of potential \nfinancial \tloss.\tIdeally,\tinsurance \tis\t\ndefined\tas\tthe\tequitable \ttransfer\tof\tthe\t\nrisk of a potential loss, from one entity to another, in exchange for a reasonable fee. Insurance company, therefore, is an association, corporation or an organisation engaged in the business of paying all legitimate claims that may arise, in exchange for a fee (known as \npremium).\nInsurance is a social device in \nwhich a group of individuals (insured) \ntransfers risk to another party (insurer) in order to combine loss experience, which provides for payment of losses from funds contributed (premium) \nby all members. Insurance is meant to \nprotect the insured, against uncertain events, which may cause disadvantage to him.\n4.5.2  Functions of Insurance\nThe various functions of insurance are as follows:\n(i) Providing certainty:  Insurance \nprovides certainity of payment for the risk of loss. There are uncertainties \nof happenings of time and amount of loss. Insurance removes these uncertainties and the assured receives payment of loss. The insurer charges premium for providing the certainity.\n(ii) Protection:  The second main \nfunction of insurance is to provide protection from probable chances of loss. Insurance cannot stop the happening of a risk or event but can compensate for losses arising out of it.\n(iii) Risk sharing:  On the happening \nof a risk event, the loss is shared by all the persons exposed to it. The share is obtained from every insured member by way of premiums.\n(iv) Assist in capital formation:  The \naccumulated funds of the insurer received by way of premium payments made by the insured are invested in various income generating schemes. \n4.5.3\n Principles of Insurance\nThe principles of insurance are the \nrules of action or conduct adopted by the stakeholders involved in the insurance business. The specific \nprinciples \tof\tutmost\tsignificance \tto\ta\t\nvalid insurance contract consists of the following:\n(i) Utmost good faith: A contract of \ninsurance is a contract of uberrimae \nfidei i.e., a contract found on utmost good faith. Both the insurer and the insured should display good faith towards each other in regard to the contract. It is the duty of the insured to voluntarily make full, accurate disclosure of all facts, material to the \nChapter 4.indd   89 31-12-2020   11:55:09\n2024-25"

                "text": "90\nBUSINESS   STUDIES\nrisk being proposed and the insurer to \nmake clear all the terms and conditions in the insurance contract. Thus, it is binding on the proposer to disclose all material facts about the subject matter of the proposed insurance. Any fact, which is likely to affect the mind of  a prudent insurer in deciding to accept \nthe\tproposal \tof\tinsurance \tor\tin\tfixing\t\nthe rate of premium is material for this purpose. Failure to make disclosure of material facts by the insured makes the contract of insurance voidable at \nthe discretion of th e insurer.  \n(ii) Insurable Interest: The insured \nmust have an insurable interest in \nthe subject matter of insurance. One fundamental fact of this principle is that ‘it is not the house, ship, machinery, potential liability of life that is insured, but it is the pecuniary interest of the insured in them, which is insured.’ Insurable interest means some pecuniary interest in the subject matter of the insurance contract. The insured must have an interest in the preservation of the thing or life insured, so that he/she \nwill\tsuffer\tfinancially \ton\tthe\thappening \t\nof the event against which he/she is insured. In case of insurance of property, insurable interest of the insured in the subject matter of the insurance must exist at the time of happening of the event. In order to name insurable interest however, it is not necessary that one should be the owner of the property. For example, a trustee holding property on behalf of others has an insurable interest in the property.(iii) Indemnity:  All insurance \ncontracts \tof\tfire\tor\tmarine\tinsurance \t\nare contracts of indemnity. According to it, the insurer undertakes to put the insured, in the event of loss, in the same position that he occupied immediately before the happening of the event insured against. In other words the insurer undertakes to compensate the insured for the loss caused to him/her due to damage or destruction of property insured. The compensation payable and the loss suffered are to be measured in terms of money. The principle of indemnity is not applicable to life insurance. \n(iv) Proximate Cause:  According to \nthis principle, an insurance policy is designed to provide compensation only for such losses as are caused by the perils which are stated in the policy. When the loss is the result of two or more causes, the proximate cause means the direct, the most dominant and most effective cause of which the loss is the natural consequence. In case of loss arising out of any mishap, the most proximate cause of the mishap should be taken into consideration.\n(v) Subrogation: It refers to the right \nof the insurer to stand in the place of the insured, after settlement of a claim,  as far as the right of insured in respect of recovery from an alternative source is involved. After the insured is compensated for the loss or damage to the property insured by him/her the right of ownership of such property passes on to the insurer. This is because the insured should not be \nChapter 4.indd   90 31-12-2020   11:55:09\n2024-25"

It implies, that in case of double insurance, the insurers are to share the losses in proportion to \nthe amount assured by each of them. \nIn case there is a loss, when there is more than one policy on the same \nproperty, the insured will have no right \nto recover more than the full amount \nof his actual loss. If the full amount is \nrecovered from one insurer the right to obtain further payment from the other insurer will cease. \n(vii) Mitigation:  This principle states \nthat it is the duty of the insured to take reasonable steps to minimise the loss \nor damage to the insured property. \nSuppose goods kept in a store house \ncatch\tfire\tthen\tthe\towner\tof\tthe\tgoods\t\nshould try to recover the goods and \nsave\tthem\tfrom\tfire\tto\tminimise \tthe\t\nloss or damage. The insured must \nbehave  with great prudence and not \nbe careless just because there is an \ninsurance cover. If reasonable care is \nnot taken like any prudent person then the claim from the insurance company may be lost. \n4.5.4  Types of Insurance\nVarious types of insurance exist \nby virtue of practice of insurance \ncompanies \tand\tthe\tinfluence \tof\tlegal\t\nenactments controlling the insurance business. Broadly speaking, ins urance \nmay be class ified\tas\tfollows:\t\nLife insurance\nSince life itself is uncertain, all \nindividuals try to assure themselves \nof a certain sum of money in the future to take care of unforeseen events or happenings. Individuals in the course of their life are always exposed to some kind of risks.\nThe risk may be of an event which \nis certain that is death. In that case, what will happen to the other members of the family who are dependent on a particular individuals income. The other risk may be living too long in which an individual may become too old to earn i.e., retirement. In this case also, the earnings will decline or end. Under such circumstances, individuals seek protection against these risks  \nand life insurance companies offer protection against such risks. \nA life insurance policy was \nintroduced as a protection against the uncertainity of life. But gradually its scope has widened and there are various types of insurance policies available to suit the requirements of an individual. For example, disability insurance, health/medical insurance, annuity insurance and life insurance proper.\nLife\tinsurance \tmay\tbe\tdefined\tas\t\na contract in which the insurer in consideration of a certain premium, either in a lump sum or by other periodical payments, agrees to pay to the assured, or to the person for whose \nbenefit\tthe\tpolicy\tis\ttaken,\tthe\tassured \t\nChapter 4.indd   91 31-12-2020   11:55:09\n2024-25"

Marine insurance provides protection against loss by marine perils or perils of the sea.  Marine perils are collision of ship with the rock, or ship attacked by the \nenemies, \tfire\tand\tcaptured \tby\tpirates\t\nand actions of the captains and crew of the ship. These perils cause damage, destruction or disappearance of the ship and cargo and non-payment of freight. So, marine insurance insures \nship hull, cargo  and freight. Thus, it is a \ndevice wherein the insurer undertakes to compensate the owner of a ship or \ncargo for complete or partial loss at sea. The insurer gurantees to make good the losses due to damage to the ship or cargo arising out of the risks incidental to sea voyages. The insurer in this case is known as the underwriter and a certain sum of money  is paid by \nthe insured in consideration for the guarantee/protection he gets. Marine insurance is slightly different from \nother types. There are three things \ninvolved i.e., ship or hull, cargo or goods, and freight.\n (a) Ship or hull insurance:  Since the \nship is exposed to many dangers \nat sea, the insurance policy is for indemnifying the insured for losses caused by damage to the ship.\n (b) Cargo insurance: The cargo while \nbeing transported by ship is subject to many risks. These may be at port i.e., risk of theft, lost goods or on voyage etc. Thus, an insurance policy can be issued to cover against such risks to cargo.\n (c) Freight insurance:  If the cargo \ndoes not reach the destination due to damage or loss in transit, the shipping company is not paid freight charges. Freight insurance is for reimbursing the loss of freight to the shipping company i.e., the insured.\nThe fundamental principles of \nmarine insurance are the same as the general principles. The main elements of a marine insurance contract are:\n (i) Unlike life insurance, the contract \nof marine insurance is a contract of indemnity. The insured can, in the event of loss recover the actual amount of loss from the \ninsurer.

These smaller quantities are then transported according to the requirements of clients to their places of business.\n (c) Stock piling:  The next function of \nwarehousing is the seasonal storage \nof goods to select businesses. Goods or raw materials, which are not required immediately for \nsale or manufacturing, are stored \nin warehouses. They are made available to business depending on customers’ demand. Agricultural products which are harvested at specific times with subsequent \nconsumption throughout the year \nalso need to be stored and released in lots.\n(d) Value added services:  Certain \nvalue added services are also provided by the warehouses, such as in transit mixing, packaging and labelling. Goods sometimes need to be opened and repackaged and labelled again at the time of inspection by prospective buyers.

He has to respect social values and norms of behaviour. A business enterprise is permitted by society to carry on industrial or commercial \nactivities \tand\tthereby\tearn\tprofits.\tBut\t\nit is obligatory on part of the business enterprise not to do anything, that is undesirable from society’s point of view. Manufacture and sale of adulterated goods, making deceptive advertisements, not paying taxes which are due, polluting the environment and exploiting workers are some examples of socially undesirable practices which \nmay\tincrease \tthe\tprofit\tof\tenterprises \t\nbut which have adverse effect on society at large. On the other hand, supplying good quality goods, creating healthy working conditions, honestly paying \ntaxes prevention/installing pollution devices in the factory, and sincerely attending to customer complaints are examples of socially desirable practices which improve the image of enterprises and also make them profitable. In fact, it is through socially responsible and ethically upright behaviour that business enterprises can get durable success.\n6.2 c oncept  of Social ReSponSibility\nSocial responsibility of business refers  \nto its obligation to take those decisions \nand perform those actions which are desirable in terms of the objectives and values of our society. The assumption of social responsibilities by business enterprises implies that they respect the aspirations of society and would try their best to contribute to the achievement of these aspirations along \nwith\ttheir\tprofit\tinterests. \tThis\tidea\tis\t\nin contrast to the common notion that Mani is a young newspaper reporter and has been writing for almost six months \non malpractices by business enterprises including such issues as misleading advertisements, supply of adulterated products, poor working conditions, \nenvironmental \tpollution, \tbribing\tgovernment \tofficials, \tand\tso\ton.\tHe\thas\tstarted\t\nbelieving that business people tend to do anything to mint money. He happens to take an interview of Mr. Raman Jhunjhunwala, chairman of a leading truck manufacturing company which is known for its fair dealing with customers, employees, investors as well as other social groups. Through this interview, Mani develops the understanding that it is possible for a business enterprise to be socially \nresponsible \tand\tethically \tupright\tand,\tat\tthe\tsame\ttime,\tbe\thighly\tprofitable. \tHe\t\nthen gets busy with studying more about the social responsibility of business and business ethics.\nChapter 6.indd   134 9/2/2022   2:11:36 PM\n2024-25"

Some others, however, hold an \nopposite \tview\tand\targue\tthat\tthe\tfirm\t\nhas a social responsibility to serve all sections of society who are affected by its decisions and actions. It would be useful to understand the arguments offered both in favour of and against the assumption of social responsibilities  \nby business.\n6.3.1  Arguments for Social \nResponsibility\n(i) Justification  for existence  and \ngrowth: \tBusiness \texists\tfor\tproviding \t\ngoods and services to satisfy human \nneeds.\tThough, \tprofit\tmotive\tis\tan\t\nimportant \tjustification \tfor\tundertaking \t\nbusiness activity, it should be looked upon as an outcome of service to the people. In fact, the prosperity and growth of business is possible only through continuous service to \nsociety. Thus, assumption of social responsibility by business provides justifications for its existence and growth.\n(ii) Long-te rm interest  of the firm: \nA\tfirm\tand\tits\timage\tstands\tto\tgain\t\nmaximum \tprofits\tin\tthe\tlong\trun\twhen\t\nit has its highest goal as ‘service to \nsociety’. When increasing number \nof members of society  — including \nworkers, consumers, shareholders, \ngovernment \tofficials, \tfeel\tthat\tbusiness \t\nenterprise is not serving its best interest, they will tend to withdraw their cooperation to the enterprise concerned. Therefore, it is in its own interest if a firm fulfills its social responsibility. The public image of any \nfirm\twould\talso\tbe\timproved \twhen\tit\t\nsupports social goals.In India, the concept of CSR is governed by Clause 135 of the Companies Act, \n2013, which was passed by both the Houses of the Parliament, and had received the assent of the President of India on 23 August 2013.\nThe CSR provisions within the Act is applicable to companies with an annual \nturnover of 1,000 crore and more, or a net worth of Rs. 500 crore and more, or a \nnet\tprofit\tof\tRs.\t5\tcrore\tand\tmore.\n\t 1.\t The \tnew\trules,\twhich\tare\tapplicable \tfrom\tthe\tfiscal\tyear\t2014-15 \tonwards, \t\nalso require companies to setup a CSR committee consisting of their board members, including at least one independent director.\n\t 2.\t The \tAct\tencourages \tcompanies \tto\tspend\tat\t2%\tof\ttheir\taverage\tnet\tprofit\tin\t\nthe previous three years on CSR activities.\n 3.

                "text": "137\nSOCIAL RESPONSIBILITIES OF BUSINESS AND BUSINESS ETHICS\n(iii) Avoidance  of government  \nregulation: From the point of view of \na business, government regulations are undesirable because they limit freedom. Therefore, it is believed that businessmen can avoid the problem of government regulations by voluntarily assuming social responsibilities, which helps to reduce the need for new laws.\n(iv) Maintenance of society:  The \nargument here is that laws cannot be passed for all possible circumstances. People who feel that they are not getting their due from the business \nmay\tresort\tto\tanti-social \tactivities, \t\nnot necessarily governed by law. This may harm the interest of business itself. Therefore, it is desirable that business enterprises should assume social responsibilities.\n(v) Availability of resources with \nbusiness:  This argument holds that \nbusiness institutions have valuable \nfinancial \tand\thuman\tresources \twhich\t\ncan be effectively used for solving problems. For example, business has a pool of managerial talent and capital resources, supported by years of experience in organising business activities. It can help society to tackle its problems better, given the huge \nfinancial \tand\thuman\tresources \tat\tits\t\ndisposal.\n(vi) Converting problems into \nopportunities: Related with the \npreceding argument is the argument that business with its glorious history of converting risky situations into \nprofitable \tdeals,\tcan\tnot\tonly\tsolve\t\nsocial problems but it can also make them effectively useful by accepting \nthe challenge.(vii) Better  environment  for doing \nbusiness: If business is to operate in \na society which is full of diverse and complicated problems, it may have little chance of success. Therefore, it is argued that the business system should do something to meet needs before it is confronted with a situation when its own survival is endangered due to enormous social illnesses. A society with fewer problems provides better environment for a firm to conduct its business.\n(viii) Holding  business  responsible  \nfor social problems:  It is argued that \nsome of the social problems have either been created or perpetuated by business enterprises themselves. Environmental pollution, unsafe workplaces, corruption in public institutions, and discriminatory practices in employment are some of these problems. Therefore, it is the moral obligation of business to get involved in solving these problems, instead of merely expecting that other social agencies will deal with them on their own.\n6.3.2  Arguments against Social \nResponsibility\nMajor arguments against social responsibility are:\n(i) Violation  of profit maximisation  \nobjective:  According to this argument, \nbusiness exists only for profit maximisation. Therefore, any talk of social responsibility is against this objective. In fact, business can best fulfill its social responsibility if it \nChapter 6.indd   137 9/2/2022   2:11:36 PM\n2024-25"

Therefore, it is unfair to tax the consumers in the name of social responsibility.\n(iii) Lack of social skills:  All social \nproblems cannot be solved the way business problems are solved. In fact, businessmen do not have the necessary understanding and training to solve social problems. Therefore, according to this argument, social problems should be solved by other specialised agencies.\n(iv) Lack  of broad public support:  \nHere the argument is that the public in general does not like business involvement or interference in social programmes. Therefore, business cannot operate successfully because of lack of public confidence and cooperation in solving social problems.\n6.3.3  Reality of Social Responsibility\nOn the basis of the above arguments for \nand against social responsibility, one may wonder what the businessmen \ndo\tin\treality.\tDo\tthey\tconcentrate \t\non\tprofit\tmaximisation? \tOr,\tdo\tthey\t\nsupport social goals? The fact is that one of the most important recent changes in the attitude of business \npeople has been the realisation that \nthey\thave\tsocial\tobligations \tto\tfulfill\t\nbesides ensuring their own existence \nthrough \tprofitable \tactivity. \tOf\tcourse,\t\npart of this realisation is not genuine and takes the form of lip service, which is thought necessary to ensure the \nsurvival \tof\tprivate\tenterprise. \tBut\tat\t\nthe same time it cannot be denied that private business does partly realise and recognise the hard reality that a \nprivately \towned\tfirm\thas\tto\tmeet\tthe\t\nchallenge of a democratic society, where all people have certain human rights and therefore, can demand responsible conduct from business. Unless the business sets its house in order, changes its outlook and is prepared to play its legitimate role as an organ of society, it has little chance of success. It will be useful here to go into some of the reasons and factors, which have forced and persuaded businessmen to consider their responsibilities and the conditions which were favourable to the development of business concern with social responsibility. Some of the more important among them are:\n(i) Threat of public regulation: \nDemocratically \telected\tgovernments \t\nof today are expected to act as welfare \nstates whereby they have to take care of all sections of society. Thus, where business institutions operate in a socially irresponsible manner, action is taken to regulate them for safeguarding people’s interest. This threat of public regulation is one important reason due to which business enterprise feels concerned with social responsibility.\nChapter 6.indd   138 9/2/2022   2:11:36 PM\n2024-25"

Accordingly, labour movement for extracting gains for the working class throughout the world has become very powerful. This has forced business enterprises to pay due regard to the welfare of workers instead of following a policy of ‘hire \nand\tfire’\tunder\twhich\tthey\tcould\tdeal\t\nwith workers at their will.\n(iii) Impact   of   consumer  \nconsciousness: \tDevelopment \tof\t\neducation and mass media and increasing competition in the market have made the consumer conscious of his right and power in determining market forces. The principle of caveat \nemptor (or let the buyer beware) has been substituted by the principle \nof\t‘customer \tis\tking’.\tBusiness \t\nenterprises have started following \ncustomer-oriented \tpolicies.\n(iv) Development  of social standard  \nfor business: \tBusinesses \tare\tno\t\nlonger considered merely money crazy entities, which can be allowed to mint money at any cost and get away with any kind of business practices. New social standards consider economic activity of business enterprises as legitimate but with the condition that they must also serve social needs. No business can be done in isolation from society. It is the society that permits business to exist and grow and it is on the basis of social standards that business functioning is to be ultimately judged.(v) Development of business \neducation: \tDevelopment \tof\tbusiness \t\neducation with its rich content of social \nresponsibility has made more and  \nmore people aware of the social purpose of business. Educated persons as consumers, investors, employees, or owners have become more sensitive towards social issues than was the case earlier, when such education was not available.\n(vi) Relationship between social \ninterest  and business  interest:  \nBusiness \tenterprises \thave\tstarted\t\nrealising the fact that social interest and business interest are not contradictory. Instead, these are complementary to each other. The feeling that business can grow only through exploitation of society has given way to the belief \nthat\tlong-term \tbenefit\tof\tbusiness \tlies\t\nin serving the society well. So also, a useful institution like business is recognised as an essential element of a modern civilised society.\n(vii) Development of professional, \nmanagerial class:  Professional \nmanagement education in universities and specialised management institutes have created a separate class of professional managers who have got an altogether different attitude towards social responsibility as compared to the earlier class of owner manager. Professional managers are more interested in satisfying a multiplicity of interest groups in society for running their enterprises successfully than \nmerely\tfollowing \tprofit\tgoals.\nThese and a number of other social \nand economic forces have combined \nChapter 6.indd   139 9/2/2022   2:11:36 PM\n2024-25"

The worker must also be ensured of a fair wage and a fair deal from the management.\n(iii) Responsibility  towards  the \nconsumers: Supply of right quality and quantity of goods and services to consumers at reasonable prices constitutes the responsibility of an enterprise toward its customers.

Pollution harms human life and the life of other species. It also degrades living conditions while wasting or depleting raw material resources. The country’s cultural heritage is also affected and \nit\tis\tbecoming \tincreasingly \tdifficult \t\nto protect all historical monuments. Pollution exists because the environment can absorb only a limited amount of pollutants and wastes. Some hazardous wastes or toxic  \nby-products \tand\tchemicals \tare\ttermed\t\nas hazardous pollutants because they have toxic characteristics that the environment can not assimilate. Pollution thus causes risks to environmental quality, human health \nand\tdamage \tto\tnatural \tand\tman-\nmade resources. Protection of the environment is directly related to the control of pollution.\n6.6.1  Causes of Pollution\nIt must be recognised that all sectors of our society viz., industry, government, agriculture, mining, energy, transportation, construction, and consumers generate waste. Wastes contain pollutants which are \nthe materials of chemicals that have \nbeen discarded during the process of \nproduction or consumption. Pollution \nis caused by these pollutants which are \nreleased into the environment beyond \nits assimilation capacity. Among the various sources of pollution, industry is a major generator of waste \nin terms of both its quantity and \ntoxicity. \tBusiness \tactivities \tsuch\tas\t\nproduction, distribution, transport, \nstorage, consumption of goods and \nservices are known to be the most \ncritical sources of environmental \npollution problems. Many business \nenterprises have been responsible for \ncausing (i) air, (ii) water (iii) land, and \n(iv) noise pollution.\nThese types of pollution are \ndiscussed as follows:\n(i) Air pollution: Air pollution is the \nresult of a combination of factors which \nlowers the air quality. It is mainly due to carbon monoxide emitted by automobiles which contributes to air pollution. Similarly, smoke and other chemicals from manufacturing plants pollute the air. Resultant air pollution has created a hole in the ozone layer leading to dangerous warming of  \nthe earth.\nEnvironmental Problems\nThe\tUnited\tNations\thas\tidentifie d\teight\tproblems \tthat\tcause\tdamage \tto\tthe\tnatural\t\nenvironment.

For years, business enterprises have been dumping waste into rivers, streams and lakes with little regard for the consequences. Water pollution has led to the death of several animals and posed a serious threat to human life.\n(iii) Land  pollution: \tDumping \tof\t\ntoxic wastes on land causes land pollution. This damages the quality of \nland\tmaking\tit\tunfit\tfor\tagriculture \tor\t\nplantation.

Noise pollution can be responsible  \nfor many diseases like loss of hearing, malfunctioning of the heart and  \nmental disorder.\n6.6.2 Need for Pollution  Control\nPollution prevention or control is needed to preserve precious environmental resources and to improve the environmental quality so that the preserved resources can \nbe\tutilised\tfor\tthe\tbenefit\tof\tmankind \t\nand the improvement of health and \nwell-being \tof\tthe\tpeople.\tThe\tamount \t\nof damage to a particular medium (air, water, land) varies according to the type of pollutant, the amount of pollutant disposed of, and the distance \nfrom\tthe\tsource\tof\tpollution. \tBut\tall\t\npollutants alter the quality of the enviro nment and render it, to some \ndegree,\tunfit\tto\tpreserve \tnormal\tlife.\t\nPeople are now raising their voice \nloudly against pollution generating \nactivities. \tBusiness \tenterprises \tcannot\t\nremain unaffected by environmental destruction.

Pollution control measures can not only check the seriousness of such diseases but can also be supportive of a healthy life on earth.\n(ii) Reduced  risk of liability:  It is \npossible that an enterprise is held liable to pay compensation to people affected by the toxicity of gaseous, liquid and solid wastes it has released into the environment. Therefore, it is sound business policy to install pollution control devices in its premises to reduce the risk of liability.\n(iii) Cost savings:  An effective pollution \ncontrol programme is also needed to save costs of operating business. Cost savings are particularly noticeable when improper production technology results in greater wastes which leads to higher cost of waste disposal and cost of cleaning the plants.\nChapter 6.indd   143 9/2/2022   2:11:37 PM\n2024-25"

Whether it is government, business enterprises, consumers, workers, or other members of society, each one can do something to stop polluting the environment. Government can enact laws to ban hazardous products. Consumers, workers and the members of society can avoid using certain products  \nand doing things that are not environment friendly.\nThe business enterprises should, \nhowever, take the lead in providing their own solutions to environmental problems.

However,  \nbusiness enterprises are run by human beings whose decisions and actions may not always be in accordance with the expectations of society. An enterprise may be good in terms of economic performance (like revenue, \ncosts\tand\tprofits)\tbut\tpoor\tin\tterms\t\nof social performance like supplying products of reasonable quality and at reasonable prices. This raises the question of what is right or wrong from society’s point of view. The answer to this question is important because business enterprises are products of \nand\tare\tinfluenced \tby\tsociety.\tThey\t\nhave to interpret and adjust to the preferences or values of society. The subject matter of ethics is concerned with establishing linkages between individual good and social good. \n6.7.1  c oncept  of buSineSS  ethicS\nThe word ‘ethics’ has its origin in the \nGreek word ‘ethics’ meaning character; norms, ideals or morals prevailing in a group or society. Ethics is concerned with what is right and what is wrong in human behaviour judged on the basis of a standard form of conduct/ehaviour of individuals, as approved by \nsociety\tin\ta\tparticular \tfield\tof\tactivity. \t\nEthics may be viewed as the entire body of moral values that society attaches to the actions of human beings. Ethics can also refer to codes or other system for controlling means so that they serve human ends. Ethical standards are often enacted into laws. \nBut\tethical\tbehaviour \tis\tjust\tand\tfair\tconduct which goes beyond observing \nlaws and government regulations. It means adhering to moral principles, being guided by particular values, and behaving in a way people ought to act. The set of principles called ethics may be written or unwritten codes or principles governing a professional or human activity.\nBusiness \tethics\tconcerns \titself\t\nwith the relationship between business objectives, practices, and techniques \nand\tthe\tgood\tof\tsociety. \tBusiness \t\nethics refer to the socially determined moral principles which should govern business activities. A few examples of business ethics are: charging fair prices from customers, using fair weights for measurement of commodities, giving fair treatment to workers and earning \nreasonable \tprofits.\tA\tbusinessperson \t\nbehaves ethically when her or his actions are upright and serve the interests of society. This, of course, also applies to those not in business. The essential difference is perhaps that businesspersons by virtue of their widespread control over society’s resources have a much greater effect on what happens in a society than persons in other areas of activity do. \nBusiness \tpeople\tand\tpoliticians \tare\t\nexpected to have higher standards over and above other people. This is perhaps the price they pay for being allowed to make decisions on behalf of society.\nThere is a growing realisation all \nover the world that ethics is vitally important for every business and for the progress of any society.

Ethical \nbusiness behaviour improves public \nimage,\tearns\tpeople’s \tconfidence \tand\t\ntrust, and leads to greater success. Ethics and profits go together in the long run. Ethics alone, and not government or laws, can make a society great. An ethically responsible enterprise develops a culture of caring for people and environment and commands a high degree of integrity in dealing with others. Ethical activity is indeed valuable in itself, for its own sake, because it enhances the quality of our lives and that of the work we do.\n6.7.2  Elements of Business Ethics\nSince ethical business behaviour is good for both the business enterprise and society, it makes sense to discuss how the enterprises can foster ethics \nin\ttheir\tday-to-day \tworking. \tSome\tof\t\nthe basic elements of business ethics while running a business enterprise are as follows:(\ni) Top management commitment: \nTop management has a crucial role in guiding the entire organisation towards ethically upright behaviour. To achieve results, the Chief Executive \nOfficer\t(CEO)\tand\tother\thigher\tlevel\t\nmanagers need to be openly and strongly committed to ethical conduct. They must give continuous leadership for developing and upholding the values of the organisation.\n(ii) Publication  of a ‘Code’:  \nEnterprises with effective ethics \nprogrammes \tdo\tdefine\tthe\tprinciples \t\nof conduct for the whole organisation in the form of written documents which\tis\treferred \tto\tas\tthe\t“code”.\t\nThis generally covers areas such as \nfundamental honesty and adherence to laws; product safety and quality; health and safety in the workplace; conflicts of interest; employment practices; fairness in selling/marketing \npractices; \tand\tfinancial \treporting.\n(iii) Establishment of compliance \nmechanisms: In order to ensure that actual decisions and actions comply with the firm’s ethical standards, suitable mechanisms should be established. Some examples of such mechanisms are: paying attention to values and ethics in recruiting and hiring; emphasising corporate ethics in training; auditing performance regularly to analyse the degree  \nof compliance; and instituting communication systems to help employees report incidents of unethical behaviour.\n(iv) Involving employees at all \nlevels: It is the employees at different \nlevels who implement ethics policies to make ethical business a reality. Therefore, their involvement in ethics programmes becomes a must. For example, small groups of employees can be formed to discuss the important \nethics\tpolicies\tof\tfirms\tand\texamine \t\nattitudes of employees towards these policies.\n(v) Measuring results:  Although it \nis\tdifficult\tto\taccurately \tmeasure \tthe\t\nend results of ethics programmes, the \nfirms\tcan\tcertainly \taudit\tto\tmonitor \t\ncompliance with ethical standards. The top management team and other employees should then discuss the results for further course of action.\nChapter 6.indd   147 9/2/2022   2:11:37 PM\n2024-25"

Also, due \nto increasing competition and fast changing technological environment, the element of risk is increasing. As a result, the company form of organisation is being preferred by more \nand\tmore\tbusiness \tfirms,\tparticularly \t\nfor setting up medium and large sized organisations.\nThe steps which are required from \nthe time a business idea originates to the time, a company is legally ready to commence business are referred to as stages in the formation of a company. Those who are taking these steps and the associated risks are promoting a company and are called its promoters.\nThe present chapter describes \nin some details the stages in the formation of a company and also the steps required to be taken in each stage so that a fair idea about these aspects can be made.  \n7.2 Formation  oF a Company\nFormation of a company is a complex \nactivity involving completion of legal formalities and procedures. To fully \nunderstand the process one can divide the formalities into three distinct stages, which are: (i) Promotion; (ii) Incorporation and (iii) Subscription of capital.\nIt may, however, be noted that \nthese stages are appropriate from \nthe point of view of formation of any kind of company. Private company as against the public limited company is prohibited to raise funds from public, it does not need to issue a prospectus and complete the formality of minimum subscription. \nIn the next section, we shall \ndiscuss the stages in the formation of a company in detail.\n7.2.1  Promotion of a Company\nPromotion is the first stage in the formation of a company. It involves conceiving a business idea and taking an initiative to form a company so that practical shape can be given to exploiting the available business opportunity. Thus, it begins with somebody having discovered a potential business idea. Any person or a group of persons or even a company Avtar, a brilliant automobile engineer, has recently developed a new carburettor in his factory which he is running as a sole proprietor. The new carburettor can cut down petrol consumption of a car engine by 40 percent. He is now thinking of producing it on a large scale for which he requires a large amount of money. He is to evaluate different forms of organisations for doing the business of manufacturing and marketing his carburettor. He decides against converting his sole proprietorship to partnership as the requirement of funds for the project is large and the product being new, there is a lot of risk involved. He is advised to form a company. He wants to know about the formalities required for the formation of a company.\nChapter 7.indd   153 9/2/2022   2:13:12 PM\n2024-25"

Thus, apart from conceiving a business opportunity the promoters analyse its prospects and bring together the men, materials, machinery, managerial \nabilities \tand\tfinancial \tresources \tand\t\nset the organisation going.\nAs per section 69, a promoter \nmeans a person \n(a) Who has been named as such in \na prospectus or is identified by the company in the annual return referred to in section 92; or\n(b) Who has control over the affairs of \nthe company, directly or indirectly whether as a shareholder, director or otherwise; or \n(c) In accordance with whose advice, \ndirections or instructions the Board of Directors of the company is accustomed to act. However, it is provided that nothing in this sub-clause shall apply to a person who is acting merely in a professional capacity.\nAfter thoroughly examining the \nfeasibility of the idea, the promoters assemble resources, prepare necessary documents, give a name and perform various other activities to get a company registered and obtain the necessary certificate enabling the company to commence business. \nThus, the promoters perform various functions to bring a company into existence. \nFunctions of a Promoter\nThe important functions of promoters \nmay be listed as below:\n(i) Identification of business \nopportunity: \tThe\tfirst\tand\tforemost \t\nactivity of a promoter is to identify a business opportunity. The opportunity may be in respect of producing a new product or service or making some product available through a different channel or any other opportunity having an investment potential. Such opportunity is then analysed to see its technical and economic feasibility.\n(ii) Feasibility studies:  It may not \nbe\tfeasible\tor\tprofitable \tto\tconvert\tall\t\nidentified \tbusiness \topportunities \tinto\t\nreal projects. The promoters, therefore, undertake detailed feasibility studies to investigate all aspects of the business they intend to start. Depending upon the nature of the project, the following feasibility studies may be undertaken, with the help of the specialists like engineers, chartered accountants  etc., to examine whether the perceived \nbusiness \topportunity \tcan\tbe\tprofitably \t\nexploited.\n( a) Technical feasibility:  Sometimes \nan idea may be good but technically not possible to execute. It may be so because the required raw material or technology is not easily available. For example, in our earlier story suppose Avtar needs \nChapter 7.indd   154 9/2/2022   2:13:12 PM\n2024-25"

If that metal is not produced in the country and because of poor political relations, it can not be imported from the country which produces it, the project would be technically unfeasible until arrangements are made to make the metal available from alternative sources.\n(b) Financial feasibility:  Every \nbusiness activity requires funds. The promoters have to estimate the fund requirements for the \nidentified \tbusiness \topportunity. \tIf\t\nthe required outlay for the project is so large that it cannot easily be arranged within the available means, the project has to be given up. For example, one may think that developing townships is very lucrative. It may turn out that the required funds are in several crores of rupees, which cannot be arranged \tby\tfloating\ta\tcompany \tby\t\nthe promoters. The idea may be abandoned because of the lack of \nfinancial \tfeasibility \tof\tthe\tproject.\t\n( c) Economic feasibility:  Sometimes \nit so happens that a project is \ntechnically \tviable\tand\tfinancially \t\nfeasible but the chance of it being profitable is very little. In such cases as well, the idea may have to be abondoned. Promoters usually take the help of experts to conduct these studies. It may be noted that these experts do not become promoters just because they are assisting the promoters in these studies.\nOnly when these investigations \nthrow up positive results, the promoters may decide to actually launch a company.\n(iii) Name approval:  Having decided \nincorporate to a company, the promoters have to select a name for \nName Clause\nA name is considered undesirable in the following cases:\n (a) If it is identical with or too closely resembles the name of an existing \ncompany\n (b) If it is misleading. It is so considered if the name suggests that the company \nis in a particular business or it is an association of a particular type when \nit is not true\n (c) If it is violative of the provisions of ‘The Emblem and Names (Prevention of \nImproper Use) Act 1950, as given in the schedule to this Act.

The proposed name may be approved if it is not considered undesirable. It may happen that another company exists with the same name or a very similar name or the preferred name is misleading, say, to suggest that the company is in a particular business when it is not true. In such cases the proposed name is not accepted but some alternate name may be approved. Therefore, three names, in order of their priority are given in the application to the Registrar of Companies. (Proforma INC1 is given at the end of the Book).\n(iv) Fixing up Signatories to the \nMemorandum of Association: Promoters have to decide about the members who will be signing the Memorandum of Association of the proposed company.

The names and addresses of shareholders and the number of shares allotted to each is submitted to the Registrar in a  statement called return of allotment. (vi) Preparation of necessary \ndocuments:  The promoter takes \nup steps to prepare certain legal \ndocuments, which have to be submitted under the law, to the Registrar of the Companies for getting the company registered. These documents are Memorandum of Association, Articles of Association and Consent of Directors.\nDocuments Required to be Submitted\n A. Memorandum of Association: \nMemorandum of Association is the most important document \nas\tit\tdefines\tthe\tobjectives \tof\tthe\t\ncompany. No company can legally undertake activities that are not contained in its Memorandum of Association. As per section 2(56)  \nof The Companies Act, 2013 “memorandum” means the memorandum of association of a company as originally framed or as altered from time to time in pursuance of any previous company law or of this Act. The Memorandum of Association contains different clauses, which are given as follows:\n(i) The name clause:  This clause \ncontains the name of the company with which the company will be known, which has already been approved by the Registrar of Companies.\n(ii) Registered  office clause:  This \nclause contains the name of the state, \nin\twhich\tthe\tregistered \toffice\tof\tthe\t\ncompany is proposed to be situated.

A company is not legally entitled to undertake an activity, which is beyond the objects stated in this clause. The main objects for which the company is formed are listed in this sub-clause.

These are called preliminary contracts or pre-incorporation contracts. These are not legally binding on the company. A company after coming into existence may, if it so chooses, decide to enter into fresh contracts with the same terms and conditions to honour the contracts made by the promoters. Note that it cannot ratify a preliminary contract. A company thus cannot be forced to honour a preliminary contract. Promoters, however, remain personally liable to third parties for these contracts.\nChapter 7.indd   161 9/2/2022   2:13:13 PM\n2024-25"

It becomes a legal \nentity with perpetual succession on such date. It becomes entitled to enter into \nvalid\tcontracts. \tThe\tCertificate \tof\t\nIncorporation is a conclusive evidence \nof the regularity of the incorporation of a company. Imagine, what would happen to an unsuspecting party with which the company enters into \na contract, if it is later found that the \nincorporation of the company was improper and hence invalid. Therefore, the legal situation is that once a \nCertificate \tof\tIncorporation \thas\tbeen\t\nissued, the company has become a legal business entity irrespective of any \nflaw\tin\tits\tregistration. \tThe\tCertificate \t\nof Incorporation is thus conclusive evidence of the legal existence of the company.

Even when a company gets registered with illegal objects, the birth of the company cannot be \nquestioned.

For doing the same, it has to issue a prospectus which is an invitation to the public to subscribe to the capital of the company and undergo various other formalities. The following steps are required for raising funds from the public:\n(i)  SEBI Approval:  SEBI (Securities \nand Exchange Board of India) which is the regulatory authority in our country has issued guidelines for the disclosure of information and investor protection. A public company inviting funds from the general public must make adequate disclosure of all relevant information and must not conceal any material information from the potential investors. This is necessary for protecting the interest of the investors. Prior approval from SEBI is, therefore, required before going ahead with raising funds from public.(ii)  Filing of Prospectus: A copy   of the prospectus or statement in lieu of \nprospectus \tis\tfiled\twith\tthe\tRegistrar \t\nof Companies. A prospectus is ‘any document described or  issued as a prospectus  including any  notice, circular, advertisement  or   other document  inviting deposits  from the public or inviting offers from the public for the subscription or purchase of any securities of, a body corporate’. In other words, it is an invitation to the public to apply for securities (shares, debentures etc.) of the company or \nto make deposits in the company. Investors make up their minds about investment in a company primarily on the basis of the information contained in this document.  Therefore, there must not be a mis-statement in the \nprospectus \tand\tall\tmaterial \tsignificant \t\ninformation must be fully disclosed.\n(iii) Appointment of Bankers, \nBrokers, Underwriters:   Raising funds \nfrom the public is a stupendous task. The application money is to be received by the bankers of the company. The brokers try to sell the shares  \nby distributing the forms and encouraging the public to apply for the shares. If the company is not reasonably assured of a good public response to the issue, it may appoint underwriters to the issue. Underwriters undertake to buy the shares if these are not subscribed by the public. They receive a commission for underwriting the issue. Appointment of underwriters is not necessary.\n(iv) Minimum Subscription:  In \norder to prevent companies from commencing business with inadequate resources, it has been provided that the company must receive applications for a certain minimum number of shares before going ahead with the allotment of shares. According to the Companies Act, this is called the ‘minimum subscription’. As per the SEBI Guidelines the limit of minimum subscription is 90 per cent of the size of the issue. Thus, if applications received for the shares are for an amount less than 90 per cent of the \nChapter 7.indd   163 9/2/2022   2:13:13 PM\n2024-25"

MSME dominate the industrial scenario in the country with sizeable proportion of labour force and tremendous export potential.MSMEs play a significant role in  \nthe economic growth and contribute \napproximately 29.7 per cent of GDP and 49.66 per cent of exports. The sector offers employment to nearly 60 million people through 28.5 million enterprises, after the agriculture sector. MSMEs are complementary to large industries as ancillary units and form an integral part of value chain for building a conducive environment for indigenous skills, grass root innovations and entrepreneurship development. This sector produces a wide range of Romi Bags of Manipur\nKhumbongmayum Dhanachandra Singh didn’t have much in life. The son of a poor tailor, he wasn’t brought up with many privileges. He saw his father working day and night to earn a meagre income. He saw the rich getting richer and the poor remaining poor. The boy wanted to do something more in life. He couldn’t imagine a life of stitching clothes relentlessly and earn just enough to survive.\nImphal is a small city in Manipur. Hardworking men and women send \ntheir children away to bigger cities so they can have opportunities to progress. Khumbongmayum’s father couldn’t afford to send him or even educate him. He just taught him what he knew— tailoring. Fabrics, stitching and clothing styles was what the boy grew up with. There was only one sewing machine and the boy used it when his father wasn’t using it. He learnt it silently because he knew it was what his father wanted, but his heart wasn’t in it.\nSometimes an incident can change your life. This happened to Khumbongmayum \nwhen he stitched a purse made out of leftover fabrics from his father’s scraps. Khumbongmayum offered the purse to his friend who marvelled at the unique design. The friend in turn showed the interesting purse to his other friends. They asked Khumbongmayum if he could make such purses for them also. It led him to wonder if there was a market for his designs. And he knew he had stumbled on to his business venture. He made a business plan and launched a purse making venture ‘Romi Bags’ in 1996. Khumbongmayum was not one to do anything on a whim. He noticed the demands of his product and he calculated his costs, expenses and expected income. In 2007, he received the National Award for bag making under Micro and Medium Enterprises.  For him, though it’s just the beginning, Khumbongmayum Dhanchandra Singh has changed his life by sheer grit, perseverance and hard work. You can’t let anything stop you from moving forward. You can’t become successful or reach the top if you don’t listen and hear effectively.\nChapter 9.indd   199 18-04-2024   11:33:03\n2024-25"

This sector has eight subgroups. They are handlooms, handicrafts, coir, sericulture, khadi \nand village industries, small scale industries and powerlooms. The Khadi and Village Industries and Coir segment is another major contributor to the growth of the MSME.

Thus, it was necessary to address the concerns of such enterprises as micro, small and medium and provide them with a single legal framework.

The emphasis on MSME has always been an integral part of India’s industrial strategy. Development of MSME prevents migration of rural population to urban areas in search of employment and contributes to other socio-economic aspects, such as reduction in income inequalities, dispersed development of industries and linkage with other sectors of the economy.\nIn fact promotion of MSME and \nrural industrialisation has been considered by the Government of India as a powerful instrument for realising the twin objectives of ‘accelerated industrial growth and creating additional productive employment potential in rural and backward areas.’\nThe following points highlight their \ncontribution.\n (i) The contribution of these \nindustries to the balanced regional development of our country is noteworthy. Small industries in India account for 95 per cent of the industrial units in the country.\n (ii) MSME are the second largest \nemployers of human resources, after agriculture. They generate more number of employment opportunities per unit of capital invested compared to large industries. They are, therefore, considered to be more labour intensive and less capital intensive. This is a boon for a \nlabour surplus country like India.\n (iii) MSME in our country supply an \nenormous variety of products which include mass consumption goods, readymade garments, hosiery goods, stationery items, soaps and detergents, domestic utensils, leather, plastic and rubber goods, processed foods and vegetables, wood and steel furniture, paints, varnishes, safety matches, etc. Among the sophisticated items  manufactured are electric and electronic goods like televisions, calculators, electro-medical equipment, electronic teaching aids like overhead projectors, air conditioning equipment, drugs and pharmaceuticals, agricultural tools and equipment and several other engineering products. A special mention should be made of handlooms, handicrafts and other products from traditional village industries in view of their export value.\n (iv) MSME which produce simple \nproducts using simple  technologies and depend on locally available resources both material and labour can be set up anywhere in the country. Since they can be widely spread without any locational constraints, the \nbenefits \tof\tindustrialisation \tcan\t\nbe reaped by every region. They, \nthus,\tcontribute \tsignificantly \tto\t\nthe balanced development of the country.\nChapter 9.indd   202 9/2/2022   2:20:50 PM\n2024-25"

The latent \nskills and talents of people can be channelled into business ideas which can be converted into reality with little capital investment and almost nil formalities to start a small business.\n (vi) MSME also enjoy the advantage \nof low cost of production. Locally available resources are less expensive. Establishment and running costs of small industries are on the lower side because of low overhead expenses. Infact, the low cost of production which small industries enjoy is their competitive strength.\n (vii) Due to the small size of the \norganisations, quick and timely decisions can be taken without consulting many people as it happens in large sized organisations. New business opportunities can be captured at the right time.\n9.5 proBlEMS aSSociat Ed With MSME\nThe potential of MSME is often not realised fully, because of several problems related to size and operations. We shall now examine some of the major problems that small businesses whether in urban or in rural areas are encountering in their day-to-day functioning.\nMSMEs are at a distinct  \ndisadvantage as compared to largescale industries. The scale of operations, \navailability \tof\tfinance, \tability\tto\tuse\tmodern technology, procurement of \nraw materials are some of these areas. This gives rise to several problems.\nThe problems majorly include \nremote location with less developed infrastructural facilities, lack of managerial talent, poor quality, traditional technology and inadequate \navailability \tof\tfinance. \tThe\tproblems \t\nof exporting small scale units include lack of adequate data on foreign markets, lack of market intelligence, \nexchange \trate\tfluctuations, \tquality\t\nstandards, \tand\tpre-shipment \tfinance. \t\nIn general the small businesses are faced with the following problems:\n(i) Finance: One of the severe \nproblems faced by MSME is that of \nnon-availability \tof\tadequate \tfinance\t\nto carry out its operations. Generally \nthese businesses begin with a small capital base. Many of the units in the small sector lack the credit worthiness required to raise as capital from the capital markets. As a result, they heavily depend on local financial resources and are frequently the victims of exploitation by the money lenders. These units frequently suffer from lack of adequate working capital, either due to delayed payment of dues to them or locking up of their capital in unsold stocks. Banks also do not lend money without adequate collateral security or guarantees and margin money, which many of them are not in a position to provide.\n(ii) Raw materials:  Another major \nproblem of MSME is the procurement \nof raw materials. If the required \nChapter 9.indd   203 9/2/2022   2:20:50 PM\n2024-25"

Their bargaining power is relatively low due to the small quantity of purchases made by them. Also, they cannot afford to take the risk of buying in bulk as they have no facilities to store the materials. Because of general scarcity of metals, chemicals and extractive raw materials in the economy, the small scale sector suffers the most. This also means a waste of production capacity for the economy and loss of further units.\n(iii) Managerial skills:  These \nbusinesses are generally promoted and \noperated by a single person, who may not possess all the managerial skills required to run the business. Many of the small business entrepreneurs possess sound technical knowledge but are less successful in marketing the output. Moreover, they may not \nfind\tenough\ttime\tto\ttake\tcare\tof\tall\t\nfunctional activities. At the same time they are not in a position to afford professional managers.\n(iv) Marketing:  Marketing is one \nof the most important activities \nas it generates revenue. Effective marketing of goods requires a thorough understanding of the customer’s needs and requirements. In most cases, marketing is a weaker area of small organisations. These organisations have, therefore, to depend excessively on middlemen, who at times exploit them by paying low price and delayed payments. Further, direct marketing may not be feasible for small business \nfirms as they lack the necessary infrastructure.\n(v)  Quality:  Many MSMEs do not \nadhere to desired standards of quality. \nInstead they concentrate on cutting the cost and keeping the prices low. They do not have adequate resources to invest in quality research and maintain the standards of the industry, nor do they have the expertise to upgrade technology. In fact maintaining quality is their weakest point, when competing in global markets.\n(vi) Capacity utilisation: Due to lack \nof marketing skills or lack of demand, \nmany\tfirms\thave\tto\toperate\tbelow\tfull\t\ncapacity due to which their operating costs tend to increase. Gradually this leads to sickness and closure of the business.\n(vii)  Global competition:  Apart from \nthe problems stated above MSME are not without fears, especially in the present context of globalisation. These enterprises face competition is not only from medium and large industries, but also from multinational companies which are giants in terms of their size and business volumes. \n9.7 MSME  and EntrEprEnEurShip \ndEvElopMEnt\nEntrepreneurship is the process of \nsetting up one’s own business as \ndistinct from pursuing any other economic activity, be it employment or practising some profession.

The output of the process, that is, the business unit is called an enterprise. It is interesting to note that entrepreneurship besides providing self-employment to the entrepreneur is responsible to a great extent for creation and expansion of opportunities for the other two economic activities, that is, employment and profession. And, in the process, entrepreneurship becomes crucial for overall economic development of a nation. \nEvery country, whether developed \nor developing, needs entrepreneurs. Whereas, a developing country needs entrepreneurs to initiate the process of development, the developed one needs entrepreneurship to sustain it. In the present Indian context, where on the one hand, employment opportunities in public sector and large-scale sector are shrinking, and on the other, vast opportunities arising from globalisation are waiting to be exploited; entrepreneurship can really take India to the heights of becoming a super economic power. Thus, the need for entrepreneurship arises from the functions the entrepreneurs perform in relation to the process of economic development and in relation to the business enterprise.\nThe following are the characteristics \nof entrepreneurship:\n( i )  Systematic Activity:  \nEntrepreneurship is not a mysterious gift or charm and something that happens by chance! It is a systematic, step-by-step and purposeful activity. \nIt has certain temperamental, skill and other knowledge and competency requirements that can be acquired, learnt and developed, both by formal educational and vocational training as well as by observation and work experience. Such an understanding of the process of entrepreneurship is crucial for dispelling the myth that entrepreneurs are born rather than made.\n(ii)  Lawful and Purposeful Activity: \nThe object of entrepreneurship is lawful business. It is important to take note of this as one may try to legitimise unlawful actions as entrepreneurship on the grounds that just as entrepreneurship entails risk, so does illicit businesses. Purpose of entrepreneurship is creation of value \nfor\tpersonal \tprofit\tand\tsocial\tgain.\n(iii)  Innovation:  From the point of \nview\tof\tthe\tfirm,\tinnovatio n\tmay\tbe\t\ncost saving or revenue-enhancing. If it does both it is more than welcome. Even if it does none, it is still welcome as innovation must become a habit!\nEntrepreneurship is creative in \nthe sense that it involves creation of value. By combining the various factors of production, entrepreneurs produce goods and services that meet the needs and wants of the society. Every entrepreneurial act results in income and wealth generation. Entrepreneurship is creative also in the sense that it involves innovation-introduction of new products, discovery of new markets and sources of supply \nChapter 9.indd   205 9/2/2022   2:20:50 PM\n2024-25"

Entrepreneur, in response to a perceived business opportunity mobilises these resources into a productive enterprise or \nfirm.\tIt\tmay\tbe\tpointed\tout\tthat\tthe\t\nentrepreneur may not be possessing any of these resources; he may just have the ‘idea’ that he promotes among the resource providers. In an economy \nwith\ta\twell-developed \tfinancial \tsystem,\t\nhe has to convince just the funding institutions and with the capital so arranged he may enter into contracts of supply of equipment, materials, utilities (such as water and electricity) and technology. What lies at the core of organisation of production is the knowledge about availability and location of the resources as well as the optimum way to combine them. An entrepreneur needs negotiation skills to raise these in the best interests of the enterprise.\n(v) Risk-taking: It is generally believed \nthat entrepreneurs take high risks. Yes, individuals opting for a career in entrepreneurship take a bigger risk that involved in a career in employment or practice of a profession \nas there is no “assured” payoff. In practice, for example, when a person quits a job to start on his own, he tries to calculate whether he or she would be able to earn the same level of income or not. To an observer, the risk of quitting a well-entrenched and promising career seems a “high” risk, but what the person has taken is a calculated risk. They are so sure of their capabilities that they convert 50 per cent chances into 100 per cent success. They avoid situations with higher risks as they hate failure as anyone would do; they dislike lower risk situations as business ceases to be a game/fun! Risk as such more than a financial stake, becomes a matter of personal stake, where less than expected performance causes \ndispleasure and distress.\n9.9 intEllEctual propErty right S \n(ipr)\nOver the past two decades, intellectual \nproperty rights have grown to a stature from where it plays a major role in the development of global economy. Intellectual property is everywhere, i.e., the music you listen to, the technology that makes your phone work, the design of your favourite car, the logo on your sneakers, etc. It exists in all the things you can see—all are the products of human creativity and skill, such as inventions, books, paintings, songs, symbols, names, images, or designs used in business, etc. All inventions of creations begin with an ‘idea’.

Legal rights conferred on such products are called ‘Intellectual Property Rights’ (IPR). Hence Intellectual property (IP) refers to products of human mind, hence, just like other types of property, the owners of IP can rent, give or sell it to other people.\nSpecifically, \tIntellectual \tproperty \t\n(IP) refers to the creations of the human mind, like inventions, literary and artistic works, symbols, names, images and designs used in business.\nIntellectual property is divided \ninto two broad categories: industrial property, which includes inventions (patents), trademarks, industrial designs and geographical indications, while the other is copyrights, which includes literary and artistic works, \nsuch\tas\tnovels,\tpoems,\tplays,\tfilms,\tmusical works, artistic works, such as drawings, paintings, photographs and sculptures and architectural designs.\nThe most noticeable difference \nbetween intellectual property and other forms of property is that intellectual property is intangible, i.e., it cannot \nbe\tdefined\tor\tindentified \tby\tits\town\t\nphysical parameters. The scope and \ndefinition \tof\tintellect ual\tproperty \tis\t\nconstantly evolving with the inclusion of newer forms. In recent times, geographical integrated circuits and undisclosed indications, protection of plant varieties, information have been brought under the protection of semi-conductors and umbrella of intellectual property. The following types of Intellectual Property Rights are recognised in India: Copyright, Trademark, Geographical Indication, Patent, Design, Plant Variety, Semiconductor Integrated Circuit Layout Design.

You must have often taken homely remedies passed on from your grandparents and great-grandparents as cure for an ailment. These homely remedies are traditional medicines that have been practiced in India for past several centuries. They are also known as ‘Traditional Knowledge’. Some examples of Indian traditional medicinal systems are Ayurveda, Unani, Siddha and Yoga. Traditional Knowledge (TK) means the knowledge, systems, innovations and practices of local communities across the globe. Such wisdom has been developed and accumulated over the years and has been used and passed down through several generations. A Traditional Knowledge Digital Library (TKDL) has been developed by Government of India, which is essentially a digital knowledge repository of Traditional Knowledge that has existed in our ancient civilization, especially about medicinal plants and formulations used in Indian systems of medicine. This rich body of knowledge helps prevents wrongful patenting of our \ntraditional knowledge.\nAnother type of IP is Trade Secrets. \nYou must have heard about the popular beverage, Coca Cola. But do you know that the recipe of this beverage is only known to three people in the whole world? This secret information is termed as a ‘Trade Secret’. A trade secret is basically \nany\tconfidential \tinformation \twhich\t\nprovides a competitive edge. Trade secrets in India are protected under the Indian Contract Act, 1872.9.9.1 Why is IPR Important for \nEntrepreneurs?\nIt encourages creation of new, path-\nbreaking inventions, such as cancer cure medicines. It incentivises inventors, authors, creators, etc., for their work. It allows the work created by a person to be distributed and communicated to the public only with his/her permission. Therefore, it helps in the prevention of loss of income. It helps authors, creators, developers and owners to get recognition for their works.\n9.9.2 t ypES of ipS\nIPRs are extremely essential for \nfostering creativity and contribute towards the economic growth of a nation. Such rights allow creators and inventors to have control over their creations and inventions. These rights create incentives for artists, entrepreneurs and inventors to further commit the necessary resources to research, develop, and market new technology and creative works. The changing global economy is creating unprecedented challenges and opportunities for continued progress in human development. There are business opportunities to market or sell IP worldwide. Geographical borders present no impediments—consumers enjoy near immediate access to almost everything. At such exciting times, it is critical that we are aware about the importance of IPRs and how it affects daily life. \nChapter 9.indd   208 9/2/2022   2:20:50 PM\n2024-25"

As a result, customers do not have to run from one place to another to complete their shopping.\n(iii)  Attractive  services:   A \ndepartmental store aims at providing maximum services to the customers. \nSome\tof\tthe\tservices \toffered\tby\tit\t\ninclude home delivery of goods, execution of telephone orders, grant of credit facilities and provision for  \nrestrooms, telephone booths, restaurants, saloons, etc.\n(iv) Economy of large-scale \noperations: As these stores are \norganised at a very large scale, the benefits of large scale operations, particularly, in respect of purchase of goods are available to them.\n(v) Promotion of sales: \tThe \ndepartmental stores are in a position to spend considerable amount of money on advertising and other promotional activities, which help in boosting their sales.Limitations\nHowever, there are certain limitations \nof\tthis\ttype\tof\tretailing. \tThese\tare\t\ndescribed as follows:\n(i) Lack of personal attention:  \nBecause of the large-scale operations, \nit\tis\tvery\tdifficult\tto\tprovide\tadequate \t\npersonal attention to the customers in \nthese stores.\n(ii) High operating cost:  As these \nstores give more emphasis on providing services, their operating costs tend to \nbe\ton\tthe\thigher\tside.\tThese\tcosts,\t\nin\tturn,\tmake\tthe\tprices\tof\tthe\tgoods\t\nhigh.\tThey\tare,\ttherefore, \tnot\tattractive \t\nto the lower income group of people.\n(iii) High possibility of loss:  As a \nresult of high operating costs and large-scale operations, the chances of incurring losses in a departmental store are high. For example, if there is any change in the tastes of customers or latest fashions, it necessitates selling of such out-of-fashion articles in clearance sale, to reduce the huge inventory of goods built up.\n(iv) Inconvenient location:  As \na departmental store is generally situated at a central location, it is not convenient for the purchase of goods that are needed at short notice.\nIn spite of some of these limitations \nthe departmental stores have been popular in some of the western countries of the world because of their benefits to a certain class of customers.\n 2.

These different shops normally deal in standardised and branded consumer products, which have rapid sales turnover. These shops are run by the same organisation and have identical merchandising strategies, with identical products and displays. Some of the important features of such shops may be described as follows:\n (a) These shops are \nlocated in \nfairly populous localities, where sufficient number of customers can be approached.  The idea is to serve the customers at a point which is nearest to their residence or work place, rather than attracting them to a central place.\n (b) The manufacturing/procurement of merchandise for all the retail units is centralised at the head office, from where the goods \nare \ndespatched to each of these shops according to their requirements.  This results in savings in the cost of operation of these stores.\n (c) Each retail \nshop is under the \ndirect supervision of a Branch \nManager, who is held responsible for its day-to-day management. The Branch Manager sends daily reports to the head office \nin respect of the sales, cash deposits, and the require-ments of the stock.\n (d) All the branches are controlled by the head office, which \nis concerned \nwith formulating the policies and getting them implemented.\n (e) The prices of\n goods in such \nshops are fixed and all sales \nare made on cash basis.  The cash realised from the sales of merchandise is deposited daily into a local bank account on behalf of the head office, and a report is sent to the head office \nin this regard.\n (f) The head office normally appoints \ninspectors, who are concerned\n \nwith day-to-day supervision of the shops, in respect of quality of customer service provided, adherence to the policies of the \nhead office, and so on.\nThe chain operation is most effective \nin handling high-volume merchandise, whose sales are relatively constant throughout the year. In India, Bata Shoe stores DCM, Nirula’s Raymonds etc., are typical examples of such shops.\nAdvantages\nMultiple shops are offering various \nadvantages to the consumers, which are described as follows:(i)\n Economies of scale: As there is\n \ncentral procurement, the multiple-shop organisation enjoys the economies of scale.\nChapter 10.indd   227 18-04-2024   11:38:20\n2024-25"

The national economies which so far were pursuing the goal of self-reliance are now becoming increasingly dependent upon others for procuring as well as supplying various kinds of goods and services. Due to increased cross border trade and investments, countries are no more isolated.The prime reason behind this \nradical change is the development  \nof communication, technology, \ninfrastructure etc. Emergence of newer modes of communication and development of faster and more \nefficient \tmeans\tof\ttransportation \thave\t\nbrought nations closer to one another.

His \nfactory is located in Gurgaon and employs about 55 workers with an investment of Rs. 9.2 million in plant and machinery. Due to recession in the domestic market, he foresees prospects of his sales going up in the next few years in the domestic market. He is exploring the possibility of going international. Some of his competitors are already in export business. A casual talk with one of his close friends in the tyre business reveals that there is a substantial market for automobile components and accessories in South-East Asia and Middle East. But his friend also tells him, “Doing business internationally is not the same as carrying out business within the home country. International business is more complex as one has to operate under market conditions that are different from those that one faces in domestic business”. Mr. Manchanda is, moreover, not sure as to how he should go about setting up international business. Should he himself identify and contact some overseas customers and start exporting directly to them or else route his products through export houses which specialise in exporting products made by others? \nMr. Manchanda’s son who has just returned after an MBA in USA suggests that \nthey should set up a fully owned factory in Bangkok for supplying to customers in South-East Asia and Middle East.

The national economies are increasingly becoming borderless and getting integrated into the world economy.  Little wonder that the world has today come to be known as a ‘global village’. Business in the present day is no longer restricted to the boundaries of the domestic country. More and more firms are making forays into international business which presents them with numerous opportunities for growth \nand\tincreased \tprofits.\tIndia has been trading with other \ncountries for a long time. But it has \nof late considerably speeded up its process of integrating with the world economy and increasing its foreign trade and investments (see Box A:  \nIndia Embarks on the Path to Globalisation). \n11.1.1  Meaning of Intern ational \nBusiness\nBusiness transaction taking place within the geographical boundaries of a nation is known as domestic or national business. It is also referred to as internal business or home trade. Manufacturing and trade beyond the boundaries of one’s own country is known as international business. International or external business can, \nBox A\nIndia Embarks on the Path to Globalisation\nInternational business has entered into a new era of reforms. India too did not \nremain cut-off from these developments. India was under a severe debt trap and was facing crippling balance of payment crisis. In 1991, it approached the International \nMonetary \tFund\t(IMF)\tfor\traising\tfunds\tto\ttide\tover\tits\tbalance \tof\tpayment \tdeficits. \t\nIMF agreed to lend money to India subject to the condition that India would undergo structural changes to be able to ensure repayment of borrowed funds. \nIndia had no alternative but to agree to the proposal. It was the very conditions \nimposed by IMF which more or less forced India to liberalise its economic  \npolicies. Since then a fairly large amount of liberalisation at the economic front has taken place. \nThough the process of reforms has somewhat slowed down, India is very much \non the path to globalisation and integrating with the world economy. While, on the one hand, many multinational corporations (MNCs) have ventured into Indian market for selling their products and services; many Indian companies too have stepped out of the country to market their products and services to consumers in foreign countries.\nChapter 11.indd   248 9/2/2022   2:24:10 PM\n2024-25"

It involves not only the international movements of goods and services, but also of capital, personnel, technology and intellectual property like patents, trademarks, know-how and copyrights.\nIt may be mentioned here that \nmostly people think of international \nbusiness as international trade. But this is not true. No doubt international trade, comprising exports and imports of goods, has historically been an important component of international business. But of late, the scope  \nof international business has substantially expanded. International trade in services such as international travel and tourism, transportation, communication, banking, ware-housing, distribution and advertising has considerably grown. The other equally important developments are increased foreign investments and overseas production of goods and services. Companies have started increasingly making investments into foreign countries and undertaking production of goods and services in foreign countries to come closer to \nforeign customers and serve them \nmore effectively at lower costs. All these activities form part of international business. To conclude, we can say that international business is a much broader term and is comprised of both the trade and production of goods and services across frontiers. 11.1.2  Reason for International \nBusiness\nThe fundamental reason behind \ninternational business is that the countries cannot produce equally well or cheaply all that they need. This is because of the unequal distribution of natural resources among them or differences in their productivity levels. Availability of various factors of production such as labour, capital and raw materials that are required for producing different goods and services differ among nations. Moreover, labour productivity and production costs differ among nations due to various socio-economic, geographical and political reasons.\nDue to these differences, it is not \nuncommon to find one particular country being in a better position to produce better quality products and/or at lower costs than what other nations can do.  In other words, we can say that some countries are in an advantageous position in producing select goods and services which other countries cannot produce that \neffectively \tand\tefficiently, \tand\tvice-\nversa.\tAs\ta\tresult,\teach\tcountry\tfinds\tit\t\nadvantageous to produce those select goods and services that it can produce more effectively and efficiently at home, and procuring the rest through trade with other countries which the other countries can produce at lower costs.  This is precisely the reason as to why countries trade with others and engage in what is known as international business. \nChapter 11.indd   249 9/2/2022   2:24:10 PM\n2024-25"

                "text": "250\nBUSINESS   STUDIES\nThe international business as it \nexists today is to a great extent the \nresult of geographical specialisation as pointed out above. Fundamentally, it is for the same reason that domestic trade between two states or regions within a country takes place. Most states or regions within a country tend to specialise in the production of goods and services for which they are best suited. In India, for example, while West Bengal specialises in jute products; Mumbai and neighbouring areas in Maharashtra are more involved with the production of cotton textiles. The same principle of territorial division of labour is applicable at the international level too. Most developing countries which are labour abundant, for instance, specialise in producing and exporting garments. Since they lack capital and technology, they import textile machinery from the developed nations which the latter are in a position to produce more \nefficiently. \t\nWhat is true for the nation is more \nor\tless\ttrue\tfor\tfirms.\tFirms\ttoo\tengage\t\nin international business to import what is available at lower prices in other countries, and export goods to other countries where they can fetch better prices for their products.

To be successful in the overseas markets, they need to adapt their product, pricing, promotion and distribution strategies and overall business plans to suit the specific requirements of the target foreign markets (see Box B on Firms need to be Cognisant of Environmental Differences). Key aspects in respect of which domestic and international businesses differ from each other are discussed below.\n(i) Nationality of buyers and sellers: \nNationality of the key participants (i.e., buyers and sellers) to the business deals differs between domestic and international businesses. In the case of domestic business, both the buyers and sellers are from the same country. This makes it easier for both the parties to understand each other and enter into business deals. But this is not the case with international business where buyers and sellers come from different countries. Because of differences in their languages, attitudes, social customs and business goals and \nChapter 11.indd   250 9/2/2022   2:24:10 PM\n2024-25"

While these factors of movement can move freely within the country, there exist various restrictions to their movement across nations. Apart from legal restrictions, even the variations in socio-cultural \nenvironments, \tgeographic \tinfluences \t\nand economic conditions come in a big way in their movement across countries. This is especially true of \nthe\tlabour\twhich\tfinds\tit\tdifficult\tto\t\nadjust to the climatic, economic and socio-cultural conditions that differ from country to country.\nBox B \nFirms need to be Cognisant of Environmental Differences\nIt is to be kept in mind that conducting and managing international business is not \nan\teasy\tventure. \tIt\tis\tmore\tdifficult\tto\tmanage \tinternational \tbusiness \toperations \t\ndue to variations in the political, social, cultural and economic environments that \ndiffer from country to country. \nSimply\tbeing\taware\tof\tthese\tdifferences \tis\tnot\tsufficient. \tOne\talso\tneeds\tto\t\nbe sensitive and responsive to these changes by way of introducing adaptations \nin their marketing programmes and business strategies. It is, for instance, a well known fact that because of poor lower per capita income, consumers in most of the developing African and Asian countries are price sensitive and prefer to buy less expensive products. But consumers in the developed countries like Japan, United States, Canada, France, Germany and Switzerland have a marked preference for high quality and high priced products due to their better ability to pay.

                "text": "252\nBUSINESS   STUDIES\n(iv) Customer heterogeneity across \nmarkets:  Since buyers in international \nmarkets hail from different countries, \nthey differ in their socio-cultural background. Differences in their tastes, fashions, languages, beliefs and customs, attitudes and product preferences cause variations in not only their demand for different products and services, but also in variations in their communication patterns and purchase behaviours. It is precisely because of the socio-cultural differences that while people in China prefer bicycles, the Japanese in contrast like to ride bikes.  Similarly, while people in India use right-hand \ndriven\tcars,\tAmericans \tdrive\tcars\tfitted\t\nwith steering, brakes, etc., on the left side. Moreover, while people in the United States change their TV, bike and other consumer durables very \nfrequently  — within two to three years \nof their purchase, Indians mostly do not go in for such replacements until the products currently with them have totally worn out.\nSuch variations greatly complicate \nthe task of designing products and evolving strategies appropriate for customers in different countries. Though to some extent customers within a country too differ in their tastes and preferences. These differences become more striking when we compare customers across nations.  \n(v) Differences in business systems \nand practices:  The differences in \nbusiness systems and practices are considerably much more among countries than within a country. Countries differ from one another in terms of their socio-economic development, availability, cost and \nefficiency \tof\teconomic \tinfrastructure \t\nand market support services, and business customs and practices due to their socio-economic milieu and historical coincidences. All such differences make it necessary for firms interested in entering into international markets to adapt their production, finance, human resource and marketing plans as per the conditions prevailing in the international markets.  \n(vi) Political system and risks: \nPolitical factors such as the type of government, political party system, political ideology, political risks, etc., have a profound impact on business operations. Since a business person is familiar with the political environment of his/her country, he/she can well understand it and predict its impact on business operations. But this is not the case with international business. Political environment differs from one country to another. One needs to make special efforts to understand the differing political environments and their business implications. Since political environment keeps on changing, one needs to monitor political changes on an ongoing  \nbasis in the concerned countries and devise strategies to deal with diverse political risks.\nA major problem with a foreign \ncountry’s political environment is a tendency among nations to favour products and services originating in \nChapter 11.indd   252 9/2/2022   2:24:10 PM\n2024-25"

Though these laws, regulations and economic policies are more or less uniformly applicable within a country, they differ widely among nations. Tariff and taxation policies, import quota system, subsidies and other controls adopted by a nation are not the same as in other countries and often discriminate against foreign products, services and capital. \n (viii) Currency used in business \ntransactions: Another important difference between domestic and international business is that the latter involves the use of different currencies. Since the exchange rate, i.e., the price of one currency expressed in relation to that of another country’s currency, keeps on fluctuating, it adds to the problems of international \nbusiness \tfirms\tin\tfixing\tprices\tof\ttheir\t \nproducts and hedging against foreign exchange risks. \n11.1.4  Scope of International \nBusiness\nAs pointed out earlier, international business is much broader than international trade. It includes not only \ninternational trade (i.e., export and import of goods and services), but also a wide variety of other ways in which the firms operate internationally. Major forms of business operations that constitute international business are as follows. \n(i) Merchandise exports and imports: \nMerchandise means goods that are tangible, i.e., those that can be seen and touched. When viewed from this perceptive, it is clear that while merchandise exports means sending tangible goods abroad, merchandise imports means bringing tangible goods from a foreign country to one’s own country. Merchandise exports and imports, also known as trade in goods, include only tangible goods and exclude trade in services.\n(ii) Service exports and imports: \nService exports and imports involve trade in intangibles. It is because of the intangible aspect of services that trade in services is also known as invisible trade . A wide variety of \nservices are traded internationally and these include: tourism and travel, boarding and lodging (hotel and restaurants), entertainment and recreation, transportation, professional services (such as training, recruitment, consultancy and research), communication (postal, telephone, fax, courier and other audio-visual services), construction and engineering, marketing (e.g., wholesaling, retailing, advertising, marketing research  \nand warehousing), educational and \nfinancial \tservices \t(such\tas\tbanking  \nChapter 11.indd   253 9/2/2022   2:24:10 PM\n2024-25"

Of these, tourism, \ntransportation and business services are major constituents of world trade in services (see Box C).\n(iii) Licensing and franchising: \nPermitting another party in a foreign country to produce and sell goods under your trademarks, patents or copy rights in lieu of some fee is another way of entering into international business. It is under the licensing system that Pepsi and Coca Cola are produced and sold all over the world by local bottlers in foreign countries. Franchising is similar to licensing, but it is a term used in connection with the provision of services. McDonalds, for instance, operates fast food restaurants the world over through its franchising system. (iv) Foreign investments:  Foreign \ninvestment is another important form \nof international business. Foreign investment involves investments of funds abroad in exchange for \nfinancial \treturn.\tForeign\tinvestment \t\ncan be of two types: direct and portfolio investments.\nDirect investment takes place \nwhen a company directly invests \nin properties such as plant and \nmachinery in foreign countries with a view to undertaking production and marketing of goods and services in those countries. Direct investment provides the investor a controlling interest in a foreign company, known as Direct Investment, i.e., FDI. It can be in the form of joint venture on PPP. A company, if it so desires, can also set \nBox C \nTourism, Transportation and Business Services dominate  \nInternational Trade in Services\nTourism and transportation  have emerged as major components of international \ntrade in services. Most of the airlines, shipping companies, travel agencies and \nhotels get their major share of revenues from their overseas customers and operations abroad. Several countries have come to heavily depend on services as an important source of foreign exchange earnings and employment. India, for example,  \nearns a sizeable amount of foreign exchange from exports of services related to travel and tourism.\nBusiness services: When one country provides services to other country and in \nthe process earns foreign exchange, this is also treated as a form of international business activity. Fee received for services like banking, insurance, rentals, engineering and management services form part of country’s foreign exchange earnings. Undertaking of construction projects in foreign countries is also an example of export of business services. The other examples of such services  include overseas management contracts where arrangements are made by one company of a country which provides personnel to perform general or specialised management functions for another company in a foreign country in lieu of the other country.\nChapter 11.indd   255 9/2/2022   2:24:10 PM\n2024-25"

Unlike foreign direct investments, the investor under portfolio investment does not get directly involved into production and marketing operations. It simply earns an income by investing in shares, bonds, bills, or notes in a foreign country or providing loans to \nforeign\tbusiness \tfirms.\n11.1.5  Benefits of International \nBusiness\nNotwithstanding greater complexities and risks, international business is important to both nations and business \nfirms.\tIt\toffers\tthem\tseveral\tbenefits. \t\nGrowing \trealisation \tof\tthese\tbenefits \t\nover time has in fact been a contributory factor to the expansion of trade and investment amongst nations, resulting in the phenomenon of globalisation. \nSome\tof\tthe\tbenefits \tof\tinternational \t\nbusiness to the nations and business \nfirms\tare\tdiscussed \tbelow.\nBenefits to Countries \n(i) Earning of foreign exchange: \nInternational business helps a country to earn foreign exchange which it can later use for meeting its imports of  capital goods, technology, petroleum \nproducts and fertilisers, pharma-ceutical products and a host of other consumer products which otherwise might not be available domestically.\n(ii) More efficient use of resources:  \nAs stated earlier, international business \noperates on a simple principle  —\nproduce what your country can \nproduce \tmore\tefficiently, \tand\ttrade\tthe\t\nsurplus production so generated with other countries to procure what they \ncan\tproduce \tmore\tefficiently. \tWhen\t\ncountries trade on this principle, they end up producing much more than what they can when each of them attempts to produce all the goods and services on its own. If such an enhanced pool of goods and services is distributed equitably amongst nations, \nit\tbenefits \tall\tthe\ttrading\tnations. \t\n(iii) Improving growth prospects and \nemployment potentials:  Producing \nsolely for the purposes of domestic consumption severely restricts a country’s prospects for growth and employment. Many countries,  \nespecially the developing ones, could not execute their plans to produce on a larger scale, and thus create employment for people because their domestic market was not large enough to absorb all that extra production. Later on a few countries such as Singapore, South Korea and China which saw markets for their products in the foreign countries embarked upon \nthe\tstrategy \t‘export\tand\tflourish’, \tand\t\nsoon became the star performers on the world map. This helped them not only in improving their growth prospects, \nChapter 11.indd   256 9/2/2022   2:24:10 PM\n2024-25"

By planning overseas expansion and procuring orders from foreign customers, they can think of making use of their surplus production capacities and also improving the profitability of their operations. Production on a larger scale often leads to economies of scale, which in turn lowers production cost and improves \nper\tunit\tprofit\tmargin.\n(iii) Prospects for growth:  Business \nfirms\tfind\tit\tquite\tfrustrating \twhen\t\ndemand for their products starts getting saturated in the domestic \nmarket. \tSuch\tfirms\tcan\tconsiderably \timprove prospects of their growth by \nplunging into overseas markets.

Highly competitive domestic market drives many companies to go international in search of markets for their products. International business thus acts as a catalyst of growth for \nfirms\tfacing\ttough\tmarket\tconditions \t\non the domestic turf. \n(v) Improved business vision:  The \ngrowth of international business of many companies is essentially a part of their business policies or strategic management. The vision to become international comes from the urge to grow, the need to become more competitive, the need to diversify and to gain strategic advantages of internationalisation.\n11.2 Modes of entry Into \nInternatIonal  BusIness\nSimply speaking, the term mode \nmeans the manner or way.

While discussing the meaning and scope of international business, we have already familiarised you with some of the modes of entry into international business. In the following sections, we shall discuss in detail important ways of entering into international business along with their advantages and limitations. Such a discussion will enable you to know as to which mode is more suitable under what conditions.\n11.2.1  Exporting and Importing \nExporting refers to sending of goods and services from the home country to a foreign country. In a similar vein, importing is purchase of foreign products and bringing them into one’s home country. There are two \nimportant \tways\tin\twhich\ta\tfirm\tcan\t\nexport or import products: direct and indirect exporting/importing. In the case of direct exporting/importing, \na\tfirm\titself\tapproaches \tthe\toverseas \t\nbuyers/suppliers and looks after all the formalities related to exporting/importing activities including those \nrelated\tto\tshipment \tand\tfinancing \tof\t\ngoods and services. Indirect exporting/importing, on the other hand, is one where the firm’s participation in  \nthe export/import operations is minimum, and most of the tasks relating to export/import of the goods are carried out by some middle men \nsuch\tas\texport\thouses\tor\tbuying\toffices\tof overseas customers located in the \nhome country or wholesale importers in the case of import operations. Such \nfirms\tdo\tnot\tdirectly\tdeal\twith\toverseas \t\ncustomers in the case of exports and suppliers in the case of imports.\nAdvantages\nMajor advantages of exporting include:\n\t •\tAs\tcompared \tto\tother\tmodes\tof\t\nentry, exporting/importing is the \neasiest way of gaining entry into international markets. It is less complex an activity than setting up and managing joint-ventures or wholly owned subsidiaries abroad.\n\t •\tExporting/importing \tis\tless\t\ninvolving in the sense that \nbusiness \tfirms\tare\tnot\trequired \t\nto invest that much time and \nmoney as is needed when they desire to enter into joint ventures or set up manufacturing plants and facilities in host countries. \n\t •\tSince \texporting/importing \tdoes\t\nnot require much of investment in foreign countries, exposure to foreign investment risks is nil or \nmuch lower than that is present \nwhen\tfirms\topt\tfor\tother\tmodes\tof\t\nentry into international business.\nLimitations\nMajor limitations of exporting/\nimporting as an entry mode of international business are as follows: \n\t •\t Since \tthe\tgoods\tphysically \tmove\t\nfrom one country to another, exporting/importing involves \nChapter 11.indd   258 9/2/2022   2:24:10 PM\n2024-25"

Especially in the case of heavy items, transportation costs alone become an inhibiting factor to their exports and imports. On reaching the shores of foreign countries, such products are subject to custom duty and a variety of other levies and charges. Taken together, all these expenses and payments substantially increase product costs and make them less competitive.\n\t •\t Exporting \tis\tnot\ta\tfeasible\toption\t\nwhen import restrictions exist in a foreign country. In such a \nsituation, \tfirms\thave\tno\talternati ve\t\nbut to opt for other entry modes such as licensing/franchising or joint venture which makes it feasible to make the product available by way of producing and marketing it locally in foreign countries.\n\t •\tExport \tfirms\tbasically \toperate \t\nfrom their home country. They produce in the home country and then ship the goods to foreign countries. Except a few visits made by the executives of export firms to foreign countries to promote their products, the export \nfirms\tin\tgeneral\tdo\tnot\thave\tmuch\t\ncontact with the foreign markets. This puts the export firms in  \na disadvan-tageous position vis-\nà-vis\tthe\tlocal\tfirms\twhich\tare\t\nvery near the customers and are able to better understand and serve them.Despite the above mentioned \nlimitations, exporting/importing is \nthe most preferred way for business \nfirms\twhen\tthey\tare\tgetting\tinitiall y\t\ninvolved with international business. As usually is the case, firms start their overseas operations with exports and imports, and later having gained familiarity with the foreign market operations switch over to other forms of international business operations.  \n11.2.2  Contract Manufacturing \nContract manufacturing refers to a type of international business where \na\tfirm\tenters\tinto\ta\tcontract \twith\tone\t\nor a few local manufacturers in foreign countries to get certain components or \ngoods\tproduced \tas\tper\tits\tspecifications. \t\nContract manufacturing, also known as outsourcing, can take three major \nforms:\n\t •\t Production \tof\tcertain\tcomponents \t\nsuch as automobile components or shoe uppers to be used later for \nproducing \tfinal\tproducts \tsuch\tas\t\ncars and shoes;\n\t •\t Assembly \tof\tcomponents \tinto\tfinal\t\nproducts such as assembly of \nhard\tdisk,\tmother\tboard,\tfloppy\t\ndisk drive and modem chip into computers; and\n\t •\tComplete \tmanufacture \tof\tthe\t\nproducts such as garments.\nThe goods are produced or assembled by the local manufacturers as per the technology and management guidance provided to them by the foreign company.

If they have any idle production capacities, \nmanufacturing jobs obtained on contract basis in a way provide a ready market for their products and ensure greater utilisation of their production capacities. This is \nhow\tthe\tGodrej\tgroup\tis\tbenefitting \t\nfrom contract manufacturing in India. It is manufacturing soaps under contract for many multinationals including Dettol soap for Reckitt and Colman.

It may be mentioned \nhere that it is not only technology that is licensed. In the fashion industry, a number of designers license the use of their names. In some cases, there is exchange of technology between the \ntwo\tfirms.\tSometimes \tthere\tis\tmutual\t\nexchange of knowledge, technology and/or patents between the firms which is known as cross-licensing. \nFranchising is a term very similar \nto licensing. One major distinction between the two is that while the former is used in connection with production and marketing of goods, the term franchising applies to service business. The other point of difference between the two is that franchising is relatively more stringent than licensing. Franchisers usually set strict rules and regulations as to how the franchisees should operate while running their business.  Barring these two differences, franchising is pretty much the same as licensing.  Like in the case of licensing, a franchising agreement too involves grant of rights by one party to another for use of technology, trademark and patents in return of the agreed payment for a certain period of time. The parent company is called the franchiser and the other party to the agreement is called franchisee. The franchiser can be any service provider be it a restaurant, hotel, travel agency, bank wholesaler or even a retailer - who has developed a unique technique for creating and marketing of services under its own name and trade mark. It is the uniqueness of the technique that gives the franchiser an edge over its \ncompetitors \tin\tthe\tfield,\tand\tmakes\tthe\t\nwould-be-service providers interested in joining the franchising system. McDonald, Pizza Hut and Wal-Mart are examples of some of the leading franchisers operating worldwide. \nAdvantages\nAs compared to joint ventures and \nwholly owned subsidiaries, licensing/franchising is relatively a much easier mode of entering into foreign markets with proven product/technology without much business risks and investments. Some of the specific advantages of licensing are as follows: \n\t •\t Under \tthe\tlicensing/franchising \t\nsystem, it is the licensor/\nChapter 11.indd   261 9/2/2022   2:24:11 PM\n2024-25"

As such, the licensor/franchiser has to virtually make no investments abroad. Licensing/franchising is, therefore, considered a less expensive mode of entering into international business. \n\t •\tSince \tno\tor\tvery\tlittle\tforeign\t\ninvestment is involved, licensor/franchiser is not a party to the losses, if any, that occur to foreign business. Licensor/franchiser is paid by the licensee/franchisee by \nway\tof\tfees\tfixed\tin\tadvance \tas\ta\t\npercentage of production or sales turnover. This royalty or fee keeps accruing to the licensor/franchiser so long as the production and sales keep on taking place in the licensee’s/franchisee’s business unit.\n\t •\t Since \tthe\tbusiness \tin\tthe\tforeign\t\ncountry is managed by the licensee/franchisee who is a local person, there are lower risks of business takeovers or government interventions. \n\t •\tLicensee/franchisee \tbeing\ta\t\nlocal person has greater market knowledge and contacts  which can prove quite helpful to the licensor/franchiser in successfully conducting its marketing operations. \n\t •\t As\tper\tthe\tterms\tof\tthe\tlicensing/\nfranchising agreement, only the parties to the licensing/franchising agreement are legally entitled to make use of the licensor’s/franchiser’s copyrights, patents and brand names in foreign \ncountries. \tAs\ta\tresult,\tother\tfirms\t\nin the foreign market cannot \nmake use of such trademarks and patents. \nLimitations\nLicensing/franchising as a mode of \ninternational business suffers from the following weaknesses.\n\t •\tWhen \ta\tlicensee/franchisee \t\nbecomes skilled in the manu-\nfacture and marketing of the licensed/franchised products, \nthere is a dang er that the licensee \ncan start marketing an identical product under a slightly different brand name. This can cause severe competition to the licenser/franchiser. \n\t •\t If\tnot\tmaintained \tproperly, \ttrade\t\nsecrets can get divulged to others in the foreign markets. Such lapses on the part of the licensee/franchisee can cause severe losses to the licensor/franchiser.\n\t •\t Over \ttime,\tconflicts \toften\tdevelop\t\nbetween the licensor/franchiser and licensee/franchisee over issues such as maintenance of accounts, payment of royalty and non-adherence to norms relating to production of quality products.

Export and import of goods is not that straight forward as buying and selling in the domestic market. Since foreign trade transactions involves movement of goods across frontiers and use of foreign exchange, a number of formalities are needed to be performed before the goods leave the boundaries of a country and enter into that of another. Following sections are devoted to a discussion of major steps that need to be undertaken for completing export and import transactions. \n11.3.1  Export Procedure\nThe number of steps and the sequence in which these are taken vary from one export transaction to another. Steps involved in a typical export transaction are as follows.\n(i) Receipt of enquiry and sending \nquotations:  The prospective buyer \nof a product sends an enquiry to different exporters requesting them to send information regarding price, quality and terms and conditions for export of goods. Exporters can be informed of such an enquiry even by way of advertisement in the press put in by the importer. The exporter sends a reply to the enquiry in the \nform of a quotation  —referred to as \nproforma invoice . The proforma invoice \ncontains information about the price at \nChapter 11.indd   264 9/2/2022   2:24:11 PM\n2024-25"

This order, also known as indent , contains a description of \nthe goods ordered, prices to be paid, delivery terms, packing and marking details and delivery instructions. \n(iii) Assessing the importer’s  \ncreditworthiness and securing a guarantee for payments:  After \nreceipt of the indent, the exporter makes necessary enquiry about the creditworthiness of the importer. The purpose underlying the enquiry is to assess the risks of non payment by the importer once the goods reach the import destination. To minimise such risks, most exporters demand a letter of credit  from the importer. A letter \nof credit is a guarantee issued by the importer’s bank that it will honour payment up to a certain amount of export bills to the bank of the exporter. Letter of credit is the most appropriate and secure method of payment adopted to settle international transactions.\n(iv) Obtaining export licence: Having \nbecome assured about payments, \nthe\texporting \tfirm\tinitiates \tthe\tsteps\t\nrelating to compliance of export regulations. Export of goods in India is subject to custom laws which demand \nthat\tthe\texport\tfirm\tmust\thave\tan\texport licence before it proceeds with exports. Important pre-requisites for getting an export licence are as follows:\n\t •\t Opening \ta\tbank\taccount \tin\tany\t\nbank authorised by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and getting an account number.\n\t •\tObtaining \tImport\tExport\tCode\t\n(IEC) number from the Directorate General Foreign Trade (DGFT) or Regional Import Export Licensing Authority.  \n\t •\tRegistering \twith\tappropriate \t\nexport promotion council.\n\t •\t Registering \twith\tExport\tCredit\tand\t\nGuarantee Corporation (ECGC) in order to safeguard against risks of non payments.\nAn\texport\tfirm\tneeds\tto\thave\tthe\t\nImport Export Code (IEC) number as \nit\tneeds\tto\tbe\tfilled\tin\tvarious\texport/\nimport documents.

Pre-\nshipment \tfinance\tis\tthe\tfinance\tthat\t\nthe exporter needs for procuring raw materials and other components, processing and packing of goods and transportation of goods to the port of shipment.  \n(vi) Production or procurement \nof goods:  Having obtained the pre-\nshipment \tfinance\tfrom\tthe\tbank,\tthe\t\nexporter proceeds to get the goods \nready\tas\tper\tthe\tspecifications \tof\tthe\t\nimporter. \tEither\tthe\tfirm\titself\tgoes\tin\t\nfor producing the goods or else it buys from the market. \n(vii) Pre-shipment inspection:  The \nGovernment of India has initiated many steps to ensure that only good quality products are exported from the \ncountry. One such step is compulsory inspection of certain products by a competent agency as designated by the government. The government has passed Export Quality Control and Inspection Act, 1963 for this purpose. and has authorised some agencies to act as inspection agencies. If the product to be exported comes under such a category, the exporter needs to contact the Export Inspection Agency (EIA) or the other designated agency \nfor\tobtaining \tinspecti on\tcerti ficate.\t\nThe pre-shipment inspection report is required to be submitted along with other export documents at the time of exports. Such an inspection is not compulsory in case the goods are being exported by star trading houses, trading houses, export houses, industrial units setup in export processing zones/special economic zones (EPZs/SEZs) and 100 per cent export oriented units (EOUs). We shall discuss about these special types of \nexport\tfirms\tin\ta\tlater\tsection.\n(viii)  Excise clearance:  As per the \nCentral Excise Tariff Act, excise duty is payable on the materials used in manufacturing goods. The exporter, therefore, has to apply to the concerned Excise Commissioner in the region with an invoice. If the Excise Commissioner is satisfied, he may issue the excise clearance.  But in many cases the government exempts payment of excise duty or later on refunds it if the goods so manufactured are meant for exports. The idea underlying such exemption \nChapter 11.indd   266 9/2/2022   2:24:11 PM\n2024-25"

The refund of excise duty is known as duty drawback. This scheme of duty drawback is presently administered by the Directorate of Drawback under the Ministry of Finance which is responsible for fixing the rates of drawback for different products.  The work relating to sanction and payment of drawback is, however, looked after by the Commissioner of Customs or Central Excise Incharge of the concerned port/airport/land custom station from where the export of goods is considered to have taken place.\n(ix) Obtaining certificate of origin: \nSome importing countries provide tariff concessions or other exemptions to the goods coming from a particular \ncountry. \tFor\tavailing\tsuch\tbenefits, \tthe\t\nimporter may ask the exporter to send a certificate of origin\n.\tThe\tcertificate \tof\t\norigin acts as a proof that the goods have actually been manufactured in the country from where the export \nis\ttaking\tplace.\tThis\tcertificate \tcan\t\nbe obtained from the trade consulate located in the exporter’s country.  \n(x) Reservation of shipping space: \nThe exporting firm applies to the shipping company for provision of shipping space. It has to specify the types of goods to be exported, probable date of shipment and the port of destination. On acceptance of application for shipping, the shipping company issues a shipping order . A \nshipping order is an instruction to the captain\tof\tthe\tship\tthat\tthe\tspecified \t\ngoods after their customs clearance at a designated port be received on board.  \n(xi) Packing and forwarding:  The \ngoods are then properly packed and marked with necessary details such as name and address of the importer, gross and net weight, port of shipment and destination, country of origin, etc. The exporter then makes necessary arrangement for transportation of goods to the port. On loading goods into the railway wagon, the railway authorities issue a ‘railway receipt’ which serves as a title to the goods. The exporter endorses the railway receipt in favour of his agent to enable him to take delivery of goods at the port of shipment. \n(xii) Insurance of goods:  The exporter \nthen gets the goods insured with an insurance company to protect against the risks of loss or damage of the goods due to the perils of the sea during the transit. \n(xiii) Customs clearance:  The goods \nmust be cleared from the customs before these can be loaded on the ship. For obtaining customs clearance, the exporter prepares the shipping bill . \nShipping bill is the main document on the basis of which the customs \noffice\tgives\tthe\tpermission \tfor\texport.\t\nShipping bill contains particulars of the goods being exported, the name of the vessel, the port at which goods \nare\tto\tbe\tdischarged, \tcountry \tof\tfinal\t\ndestination, exporter’s name and address, etc.  \nFive copies of the shipping bill \nalong with the following documents \nChapter 11.indd   267 9/2/2022   2:24:11 PM\n2024-25"

Carting \norder is the instruction to the staff at the gate of the port to permit the entry of the cargo inside the dock. After obtaining the carting order, the cargo is physically moved into the port area and stored in the appropriate shed. Since the exporter cannot make himself or herself available all the time for performing all these formalities, these tasks are entrusted to an \nagent  —referred to as Clearing and \nForwarding (C&F) agent.\n(xiv) Obtaining mates receipt:  The \ngoods are then loaded on board the ship for which the mate or the captain of the ship issues mate’s receipt  to the \nport superintendent. A mate receipt is a receipt issued by the commanding officer of the ship when the cargo is loaded on board, and contains the information about the name of the vessel, berth, date of shipment, descripton of packages, marks and numbers, condition of the cargo at the time of receipt on board the ship, etc. The port superintendent, on receipt of port dues, hands over the mate’s receipt to the C&F agent. (xv) Payment of freight and issuance \nof bill of lading: The C&F agent \nsurrenders the mates receipt to the shipping company for computation of freight. After receipt of the freight, the shipping company issues a bill of lading \nwhich serves as an evidence that the shipping company has accepted the goods for carrying to the designated destination. In the case the goods are being sent by air, this document is referred to as airway bill . \n(xvi) Preparation of invoice:  After \nsending the goods, an invoice of the despatched goods is prepared. The invoice states the quantity of goods sent and the amount to be paid by the importer. The C&F agent gets it duly attested by the customs. \n(xvii)  Securing payment:  After  \nthe shipment  of goods, the exporter \ninforms the importer about the shipment of goods. The importer needs various documents to claim the title of goods on their arrival at his/her country and getting them customs cleared. The documents that are needed in this connection \ninclude\tcertified \tcopy\tof\tinvoice,\tbill\tof\t\nlading, packing list, insurance policy, \ncertificate \tof\torigin\tand\tletter\tof\tcredit.\t\nThe exporter sends these documents through his/her banker with the instruction that these may be delivered to the importer after acceptance of the bill of exchange\n — a document which is \nsent along with the above mentioned documents. Submission of the relevant documents to the bank for the purpose of getting the payment from the bank is called ‘negotiation of the documents’. \nChapter 11.indd   268 9/2/2022   2:24:11 PM\n2024-25"

It can be of two types: document against sight (sight draft) or document against acceptance (usance draft). In case of sight draft, the documents are handed over to the importer only against payment. The moment the importer agrees to sign the sight draft, the relevant documents are delivered. In the case of usance draft, on the other hand, the documents are delivered to the importer against his or her acceptance of the bill of exchange for making payment at the end of a \nspecified \tperiod,\tsay\tthree\tmonths.\nOn receiving the bill of exchange, \nthe importer releases the payment in case of sight draft or accepts the usance draft for making payment on maturity of the bill of exchange. The exporter’s bank receives the payment through the importer’s bank and is credited to the exporter’s account.\nThe exporter, however, need not \nwait for the payment till the release of money by the importer. The exporter can get immediate payment from his/her bank on the submission of documents by signing a letter of \nindemnity. By signing the letter, the exporter undertakes to indemnify the bank in the event of non-receipt of payment from the importer along with accrued interest. \nHaving received the payment for \nexports, the exporter needs to get a bank \ncertificate \tof\tpayment. \tBank\tcertificate \t\nof payment is a certificate which says that the necessary documents \n(including bill of exchange) relating to the particular export consignment has been negotiated (i.e., presented to the importer for payment) and the payment has been received in accordance with \nthe exchange control regulations.\n11.3.2  Import Procedure \nImport trade refers to purchase of \ngoods from a foreign country. Import procedure differs from country to country depending upon the country’s import and custom policies and other statutory requirements. The following paragraphs discuss various steps involved in a typical import transaction for bringing goods into Indian territory.\n(i) Trade enquiry:  The first thing \nthat the importing firm has to do is to gather information about the countries and firms which export the given product. The importer can gather such information from the trade directories and/or trade associations \nand\torganisations. \tHaving\tidentified \t\nthe\tcountries \tand\tfirms\tthat\texport  \nthe product, the importing firm \napproaches \tthe\texport\tfirms\twith\tthe\t\nhelp of a trade enquiry for collecting information about their export prices and terms of exports. A trade enquiry is a written request by an importing firm to the exporter for supply of information regarding the price and various terms and conditions on which the latter is ready to exports goods. \nAfter receivin g a trade enquiry, \nthe exporter prepares a quotation and sends it to the importer. The quotation \nChapter 11.indd   269 9/2/2022   2:24:11 PM\n2024-25"

A \nproforma invoice is a document that \ncontains details as to the quality, grade, design, size, weight and price of the export product, and the terms and conditions on which their export \nwill take pl ace. \n(ii) Procurement of import licence: \nThere are certain goods that can be \nimported freely, while others need licensing. The importer needs to consult the Export Import (EXIM) policy in force to know whether the goods that he or she wants to import are subject to import licensing. In case goods can be imported only against the licence, the importer needs to procure an import licence. In India, it is obligatory for every importer (and also for exporter) to get registered with the Directorate General Foreign Trade (DGFT) or Regional Import Export Licensing Authority, and obtain an Import Export Code (IEC) number. This number is required to be mentioned on most of the import documents. \nMajor Documents needed in Connection with Export Transaction\nA. Docume nts related to goods \nExport invoice:  Export invoice is a sellers’ bill for merchandise and contains \ninformation about goods such as quantity, total value, number of packages, marks \non packing, port of destination, name of ship, bill of lading number, terms of delivery and payments, etc. Packing list: A packing list is a statement of the number of cases or packs and the details of the goods contained in these packs. It gives details of the nature of goods which are being exported and the form in which these are being sent.

The goods are allowed to be brought into the importing country if these are not originating from the banned countries. Certificate of inspection:  For ensuring quality, the government has made it \ncompulsory for certain products that these be inspected by some authorised agency.

As stated previously, a letter of credit is a guarantee issued by the importer’s bank that it will honour payment up to a certain amount of export bills to the bank of the exporter. Letter of credit is the most appropriate and secured method of payment adopted to settle international transactions. The exporter wants this document to be sure that there is no risk of non-payment. \n(vi) Arranging for finance:  The \nimporter should make arrangements in advance to pay to the exporter on arrival of goods at the port. Advanced planning for financing imports is necessary so as to avoid huge demurrages (i.e., penalties) on the imported goods lying uncleared at the port for want of payments. \n(vii) Receipt of shipment advice:  \nAfter loading the goods on the vessel, the overseas supplier dispatches the shipment advice  to the importer. A \nshipment advice contains information about the shipment of goods. The information provided in the shipment advice includes details such as invoice number, bill of lading/airways bill number and date, name of the vessel with date, the port of export, description of goods and quantity, and the date of sailing of vessel.\n(viii)  Retirement of import  \ndocuments:  Having shipped the \ngoods, the overseas supplier prepares a set of necessary documents as per (iii) Obtaining foreign exchange: \nSince the supplier in the context of an import transaction resides in a foreign country, he/she demands payment in a foreign currency. Payment in foreign currency involves exchange of Indian currency into foreign currency. In India, all foreign exchange transactions are regulated by the Exchange Control Department of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). As per the rules in force, every importer is required to secure the sanction of foreign exchange. For obtaining such a sanction, the importer has to make an application to a bank authorised by RBI to issue foreign exchange. The application is made in a prescribed form along with the import licence as per the provisions of Exchange Control Act. After proper scrutiny of the application, the bank sanctions the necessary foreign exchange for the import transaction.\n(iv) Placing order or indent:  After \nobtaining the import licence, the importer places an import order or indent with the exporter for supply \nof\tthe\tspecified \tproducts. \tThe\timport\t\norder contains information about the price, quantity size, grade and quality of goods ordered and the instructions relating to packing, shipping, ports of shipment and destination, delivery schedule, insurance and mode of payment.

The set of documents normally contains bill of exchange, commercial invoice, bill of lading/airway bill, packing list, certificate of origin, marine insurance policy, etc.\nThe bill of exchange accompanying \nthe above documents is known as the documentary bill of exchange. As mentioned earlier in connection with the export procedure, documentary bill of exchange can be of two types: documents against payment (sight draft) and documents against acceptance (usance draft). In the case of sight draft, the drawer instructs the bank to hand over the relevant documents to the importer only against payment. But in the case of usance draft, the drawer instructs the bank to hand over the relevant documents to the importer against acceptance of the bill of exchange. The acceptance of bill of exchange for the purpose of getting delivery of the documents is known as retirement of import documents.  Once the retirement \nis over, the bank hands over the import \ndocuments to the importer.\n(ix) Arrival of goods:  Goods are \nshipped by the overseas supplier as \nper the contract. The person in charge of the carrier (ship or airway) informs \nthe\tofficer\tin\tcharge\tat\tthe\tdock\tor\t\nthe airport about the arrival of goods in the importing country. He provides the document called import general  manifest .  Import general manifest is a \ndocument that contains the details of the imported goods. It is a document on the basis of which unloading of cargo takes place. \n(x) Customs clearance and release \nof goods:  All the goods imported \ninto India have to pass through \ncustoms clearance after they cross the Indian borders.  Customs clearance is a somewhat tedious process and calls for completing a number of formalities.  It is, therefore, advised that importers appoint C&F agents who are  \nwell- versed with such formalities and play an important role in getting the goods customs cleared.\nFirstly, the importer has to obtain \na delivery order  which is otherwise \nknown as endorsement for delivery. Generally when the ship arrives at the port, the importer obtains the endorsement on the back of the bill of lading. This endorsement is done by the concerned shipping company. In some cases instead of endorsing the bill, the shipping company issues a delivery order. This order entitles the importer to take the delivery of goods. \nOf\tcourse,\tthe\timporter \thas\tto\tfirst\tpay\t\nthe freight charges (if these have not been paid by the exporter) before he or she can take possession of the goods.\nThe importer has to also pay \ndock dues and obtain port trust dues \nreceipt.
