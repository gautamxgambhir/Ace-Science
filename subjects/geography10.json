It was\nbelieved that resources are free gifts of nature.\nAs a result, human beings used them\nindiscriminately and this has led to the\nfollowing major problems.\n•Depletion of resources for satisfying the\ngreed of a few individuals.\n•Accumulation of resources in few hands, which,\nin turn, divided the society into two segments\ni.e. haves  and have nots or rich and poor.\n•Indiscriminate exploitation of resources has\nled to global ecological crises such as, global\nwarming, ozone layer depletion, environmental\npollution and land degradatio n.\nAn equitable distribution of resources has\nbecome essential for a sustained quality of life\nand global peace.

The Summit was\nconvened for addressing urgent problems of\nenvironmental protection and socio-\neconomic development at the global level.\nThe assembled leaders signed the\nDeclaration on Global Climatic Change and\nBiological Diversity .

There are some regions which can\nbe considered self sufficient in terms of the\navailability of resources and there are some\nregions which have acute shortage of some vital\nresources. For example, the states of\nJharkhand, Chhattisgarh and Madhya\nPradesh are rich in minerals and coal deposits.\nArunachal Pradesh has abundance of water\nresources but lacks in infrastructural\ndevelopment. The state of Rajasthan is very well\nendowed with solar and wind energy but lacks\nin water resources. The cold desert of Ladakh\nis relatively isolated from the rest of the\ncountry. It has very rich cultural heritage but\nit is deficient in water , infrastructur e and some\nvital minerals. This calls for balanced resource\nplanning at the national, state, regional and\nlocal levels.technology and institutions may hinder\ndevelopment. There are many regions in our\ncountry that are rich in resources but these\nare included in economically backward\nregions. On the contrary there are some regions\nwhich have a poor resource base but they are\neconomically developed.\nCan you name some resource rich but\neconomically backward regions and some\nresource poor but economically developed\nregions? Give reasons for such a situation.\nThe history  of colonisation reveals that\nrich resources in colonies were the main\nattractions for the foreign invaders. It was\nprimarily the higher level of technological\ndevelopment of the colonising countries that\nhelped them to exploit resources of other\nregions and establish their supremacy over\nthe colonies. Therefore, resources can\ncontribute to development only when they are\naccompanied by appropriate technological\ndevelopment and institutional changes. India\nhas experienced all this in different phases of\ncolonisation. Therefore, in India, development,\nin general, and resource development in\nparticular does not only involve the\navailability of resources, but also the\ntechnology, quality of human resources and\nthe historical experiences of the people.\nConservation of Resources:  Resources are\nvital for any developmental activity. But\nirrational consumption and over -utilisation\nof resources may lead to socio-economic and\nenvironmental problems. To overcome these\nproblems, resource conservation at various\nlevels is important. This had been the main\nconcern of the leaders and thinkers in the\npast. For example, Gandhiji was very apt in\nvoicing his concern about resource\nconservation in these words : “There is enoughResource Planning in India\nResource planning is a complex process\nwhich involves : (i) identification and\ninventory of resources across the regions of\nthe country. This involves surveying,\nmapping and qualitative and quantitative\nestimation and measurement of the\nresources. (ii) Evolving a planning structure\nendowed with appropriate technology, skill\nand institutional set up for implementing\nresource development plans. (iii) Matching\nthe resource development plans with overall\nnational development plans.\nIndia has made concerted efforts for\nachieving the goals of resource planning right\nfrom the First Five Y ear Plan launched after\nIndependence.\nThe availability of resources is a necessary\ncondition for the development of any region,\nbut mere availability of resources in the\nabsence of corresponding changes in\nWhat resources are being developed in your\nsurroundings by the community/village\npanchayats/ward level communities with the\nhelp of community participation?\nPrepare a list of resources found in your state\nand also identify the resources that are\nimportant but deficit in your st ate.\nReprint 2024-25"

He was against\nmass production and wanted to replace it with\nthe production by the masses.\nAt the international level, the Club of Rome\nadvocated resource conservation for the first\ntime in a more systematic way in 1968.\nSubsequently , in 1974, Gandhian philosophy\nwas once again presented by Schumacher\nin his book Small is Beautiful . The seminal\ncontribution with respect to resource\nconservation at the global level was made\nby the Brundtland Commission Report, 1987.\nThis report introduced the concept of\n‘Sustainable Development’ and advocated\nit as a means for resource conservation,\nwhich was subsequently published in a book\nentitled Our Common Future .

W aste land\nincludes rocky, arid and d esert areas and land\nput to other non-agricultural uses includes\nsettlements, roads, railways, industry etc.\nContinuous use of land over a long period of\ntime without taking appropriate measures to\nconserve and manage it, has resulted in land\ndegradation. This, in turn, has serious\nrepercussions on society and the\nenvir onment.\nLAND DEGRADA TION AND CONSER VATION\nMEASURES\nWe have shar ed our land with the past\ngenerations and will have to do so with the future\ngenerations too. Ninety-five per cent of our basic\nneeds for food, shelter and clothing are obtained\nfrom land. Human activities have not only\nbrought about degradation of land but have\nalso aggravated the pace of natural forces to\ncause damage to land.\nSome human activities such as\ndeforestation, over grazing, mining and\nquarrying too have contributed significantly in\nland degradation.\nMining sites are abandoned after\nexcavation work is complete leaving deep\nscars and traces of over -burdening. In states\nlike Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, Madhya\nPradesh and Odisha deforestation due to\nmining have caused severe land degradation.\nIn states like Gujarat, Rajasthan, Madhya\nPradesh and Maharashtra overgrazing is one\nof the main reasons for land degradation. In\nthe states of Punjab, Haryana, western Uttar\nPradesh, over irrigation is responsible for land\ndegradation due to water logging leading to\nincrease in salinity and alkalinity in the soil.\nThe mineral processing like grinding of\nlimestone for cement industry and calcite and\nsoapstone for ceramic industry generate huge\nquantity of dust in the atmosphere. It retards\nthe process of infiltration of water into the soil\nafter it settles down on the land. In recent\nyears, industrial effluents as waste have\nbecome a major source of land and water\npollution in many parts of the country.There are many ways to solve the problems\nof land degradation. Afforestation and proper\nmanagement of grazing can help to some extent.\nPlanting of shelter belts of plants, control on\nover grazing, stabilisation of sand dunes by\ngrowing thorny bushes are some of the\nmethods to check land degradation in arid\nareas. Proper management of waste lands,\ncontrol of mining activities, proper discharge\nand disposal of industrial ef fluents and wastes\nafter treatment can reduce land and water\ndegradation in industrial and suburban areas.\nSOIL AS A RESOURCE\nSoil is the most important renewable natural\nresour ce.

Due\nto its high fertility, regions of alluvial soils are\nintensively cultivated and densely populated.\nSoils in the drier areas are more alkaline and\ncan be productive after proper treatment and\nirrigation.\nBlack Soil\nThese soils are black in colour and are also\nknown as regur  soils. Black soil is ideal for\ngrowing cotton and is also known as black\ncotton soil . It is believed that climatic condition\nalong with the parent rock material are the\nimportant factors for the formation of black\nsoil. This type of soil is typical of the Deccan\ntrap ( Basalt ) region spread over northwest\nDeccan plateau and is made up of lava flows.\nThey cover the plateaus of Maharashtra,\nSaurashtra, Malwa, Madhya Pradesh and\nChhattisgar h and extend in the south east\ndirection along the Godavari and the Krishna\nvalleys.\nFig. 1.6:   Alluvial Soil\nThe alluvial soil consists of various\nproportions of sand, silt and clay. As we move\ninlands towards the river valleys, soil particles\nappear some what bigger in size. In the upper\nreaches of the river valley i.e. near the place\nof the break of slope, the soils are coarse. Such\nsoils are more common in piedmont plains\nsuch as Duars, Chos  and Terai .\nApart from the size of their grains or\ncomponents, soils are also described on the\nbasis of their age.

Y elllow\nand red soils are also found in parts of\nOdisha, Chhattisgarh, souther n parts of the\nmiddle Ganga plain and along the piedmont\nzone of the W estern Ghats. These soils develop\na reddish colour due to dif fusion of ir on in\ncrystalline and metamorphic r ocks.

The laterite soil\ndevelops under tropical and subtropical\nclimate with alternate wet and dry season.\nThis soil is the result of intense leaching due\nto heavy rain. Lateritic soils ar\ne mostly deep\nto very deep, acidic (pH<6.0), generally\ndeficient in plant nutrients and occur mostly\nin souther n states, W ester n Ghats region of\nMaharashtra, Odisha, some parts of W est\nBengal and North-east regions. Where these\nsoils support deciduous and evergreen\nforests, it is humus rich, but under sparsevegetation and in semi-arid environment, it is\ngenerally humus poor .

In some areas the salt content is\nvery high and common salt is obtained by\nevaporating the water. Due to the dry climate,\nhigh temperature, evaporation is faster and\nthe soil lacks humus and moisture.

The processes of soil formation and\nerosion, go on simultaneously and generally\nthere is a balance between the two. Sometimes,\nthis balance is disturbed due to human\nactivities like defor estation, over -grazing,\nconstruction and mining etc., while natural\nforces like wind, glacier and water lead to\nsoil erosion. The running water cuts through\nthe clayey soils and makes deep channels as\ngullies . The land becomes unfit for cultivation\nand is known as \nbad land . In the Chambal\nbasin such lands are called ravines.\nSometimes water flows as a sheet over large\nareas down a slope. In such cases the top\nFig. 1.11:  Gully Erosion\nsoil is washed away. This is known as sheet\nerosion . Wind blows loose soil of f flat or\nsloping land known as wind erosion. Soil\nerosion is also caused due to defective methods\nof farming. Ploughing in a wrong way i.e. up\nand down the slope form channels for the\nquick flow of water leading to soil erosion.\nPloughing along the contour lines can\ndecelerate the flow of water down the slopes.\nThis is called contour ploughing. Steps can\nbe cut out on the slopes making terraces.\nTerrace cultivation r estricts er osion. W ester n\nand central Himalayas have well developed\nterrace farming. Large fields can be divided into\nstrips. Strips of grass are left to grow between\nthe crops. This breaks up the force of the wind.\nThis method is known as strip cropping.\nPlanting lines of trees to create shelter also\nworks in a similar way. Rows of such trees are\ncalled shelter belts. These shelter belts have\ncontributed significantly to the stabilisation of\nsand dunes and in stabilising the desert in\nwestern India.\nFig. 1.10:  Soil Erosion\nReprint 2024-25"

Besides food grains, it also\nproduces raw material for various industries.\nCan you name some industries based on\nagricultural raw material?\nMoreover , some agricultural pr oducts like tea,\ncoffee, spices, etc. are also exported.\nTYPES OF FARMING\nAgriculture is an age-old economic activity in\nour country. Over these years, cultivation\nmethods have changed significantly depending\nupon the characteristics of physical\nenvironment, technological know-how and\nsocio-cultural practices. Far ming varies from\nsubsistence to commercial type. At present,\nin dif ferent parts of India, the following\nfarming systems are practised.\nPrimitive Subsistence Farming\nThis type of farming is still practised in few\npockets of India. Primitive subsistence\nagriculture is practised on small patches of\nland with the help of primitive tools like hoe,\ndao and digging sticks, and family/\ncommunity labour . This type of far ming\ndepends upon monsoon, natural fertility of\nthe soil and suitability of other environmental\nconditions to the crops grown.\nIt is a ‘slash and bur n’ agricultur e.\nFarmers clear a patch of land and pr oduce\ncereals and other food crops to sustain their\nfamily. When the soil fertility decr eases, the\nfarmers shift and clear a fresh patch of land\nfor cultivation. This type of shifting allows\nNature to replenish the fertility of the soilthrough natural processes; land productivity\nin this type of agriculture is low as the farmer\ndoes not use fertilisers or other modern\ninputs.

It is labour -\nintensive farming, where high doses of\nbiochemical inputs and irrigation are used\nfor obtaining higher production.\nCan you name some of the states of India\nwhere such farming is practised?\nThough the ‘right of inheritance’ leading\nto the division of land among successive\ngenerations has rendered land-holding size\nuneconomical, the farmers continue to take\nmaximum output from the limited land in\nthe absence of alternative source of livelihood.\nThus, there is enormous pressure on\nagricultural land.\nCommercial Farming\nThe main characteristic of this type of farming\nis the use of higher doses of modern inputs,\ne.g. high yielding variety (HYV) seeds, chemical\nfertilisers, insecticides and pesticides in order\nto obtain higher productivity. The degr ee of\ncommercialisation of agriculture varies from\none r egion to another . For example, rice is a\ncommercial crop in Haryana and Punjab, but\nin Odisha, it is a subsistence crop.\nCan you give some more examples of crops\nwhich may be commercial in one region and\nmay provide subsistence in another region?Plantation is also a type of commercial\nfarming. In this type of farming, a single crop\nis grown on a large area. The plantation has\nan inter face of agricultur e and industry.\nPlantations cover large tracts of land, using\ncapital intensive inputs, with the help of\nmigrant labour ers.

Thus,\ncollectivisation, consolidation of holdings,\ncooperation and abolition of zamindari, etc.\nwere given priority to bring about institutional\nreforms in the country after Independence.\n‘Land reform’ was the main focus of our First\nFive Y ear Plan.

Although,\nover 2000 minerals have been identified, only\na few are abundantly found in most of the\nrocks.\nA particular mineral that will be formed\nfrom a certain combination of elements\ndepends upon the physical and chemical\nconditions under which the material forms.\nThis, in turn, results in a wide range of colours,\nhardness, crystal forms, lustre and density that\na particular mineral possesses. Geologists use\nthese properties to classify the minerals.\nStudy of Minerals by Geographers\nand Geologists\nGeographers study minerals as part of the\nearth ’s crust for a better understanding of\nlandforms. The distribution of mineral\nresources and associated  economic activities\nare of interest to geographers.

The\nterm ore is used to describe an accumulation\nof any mineral mixed with other elements.\nThe mineral content of the ore must be insufficient concentration to make its extraction\ncommercially viable. The type of formation or\nstructure in which they are found determines\nthe relative ease with which mineral ores may\nbe mined. This also determines the cost of\nextraction. It is, ther efore, important for us\nto understand the main types of formations\nin which minerals occur .\nMinerals generally occur in these for ms:\n(i)In igneous and metamorphic rocks\nminerals may occur in the cracks,\ncrevices, faults or joints. The smaller\noccurrences are called veins  and the\nlarger are called  lodes . In most cases,\nthey are formed when minerals in liquid/\nmolten and gaseous forms are forced\nupward through cavities towards the\nearth’s surface. They cool and solidify as\nthey rise. Major metallic minerals like tin,\ncopper , zinc and lead etc. ar e obtained\nfrom veins and lodes.\n(ii)In sedimentary rocks a number of minerals\noccur in beds  or layers . They have been\nformed as a result of deposition,\naccumulation and concentration in\nhorizontal strata. Coal and some forms of\niron ore have been concentrated as a result\nof long periods under great heat and\npressur e. Another group of sedimentary\nminerals include gypsum, potash salt and\nsodium salt. These are formed as a result\nof evaporation  especially in arid regions.\n(iii)Another mode of for mation involves the\ndecomposition of surface rocks, and the\nremoval of soluble constituents, leaving\na residual mass of weathered\nmaterial  containing ores.

Do you know that most\nof the minerals in India are nationalised\nand their extraction is possible only after\nobtaining due permission from the\ngovernment? But in most of the tribal\nareas of the north-east India, minerals are\nowned by individuals or communities. In\nMeghalaya, there are large deposits of coal,\niron ore, limestone and dolomite etc. Coal\nmining in Jowai and Cherapunjee is done\nby family member in the form of a long\nnarrow tunnel, known as ‘Rat hole’\nmining. The National Gr een T ribunal has\ndeclared such activities illegal and\nrecommended that these  should be\nstopped forthwith.(iv)Certain minerals may occur as alluvial\ndeposits in sands of valley floors and the\nbase of hills. These deposits are called\n‘placer deposits’ and generally contain\nminerals, which ar e not corr oded by water .\nGold, silver , tin and platinum ar e most\nimportant among such minerals.\n(v)The ocean waters contain vast quantities\nof minerals, but most of these are too widely\ndiffused to be of economic significance.\nHowever , common salt, magnesium and\nbromine are largely derived from ocean\nwaters.

These variations exist largely because\nof the differences in the geological structure,\nprocesses and time involved in the formation\nof minerals.\nLet us now study the distribution of a few\nmajor minerals in India. Always remember that\nthe concentration of mineral in the ore, the ease\nof extraction and closeness to the market play\nan important role in affecting the economic\nviability of a reserve. Thus, to meet the demand,\na choice has to be made between a number of\npossible options. When this is done a mineral\n‘deposit’ or ‘reserve’ turns into a mine .\nFerrous Minerals\nFerrous minerals account for about three-\nfourths of the total value of the production of\nmetallic minerals. They provide a strong base\nfor the development of metallurgical industries.\nIndia exports substantial quantities of ferrous\nminerals after meeting her internal demands.\nIron Ore\nIron ore is the basic mineral and the backbone\nof industrial development. India is endowed\nwith fairly abundant resources of iron ore. India\nis rich in good quality iron ores. Magnetite is\nthe finest iron ore with a very high content of\niron up to 70 per cent. It has excellent magnetic\nqualities, especially valuable in the electrical\nindustry. Hematite ore is the most important\nindustrial iron ore in terms of the quantity\nused, but has a slightly lower iron content than\nmagnetite. (50-60 per cent). In 2018–19 almost\nentire production of iron ore (97%) accrued\nfrom Odisha, Chhattisgarh, Karnataka and\nJharkhand. The remaining production (3%)\nwas from other states.India is fortunate to have fairly rich and\nvaried mineral r esour\nces. However , these ar e\nunevenly distributed.

Ener gy\nresources can be classified as conventional\nand non-conventional sources. Conventional\nsources include: firewood, cattle dung cake,\ncoal, petroleum, natural gas and electricity\n(both hydel and thermal). Non-conventional\nsources include solar , wind, tidal, geother mal,\nbiogas and atomic ener gy. Fir ewood and cattle\ndung cake are most common in rural India.\nAccording to one estimate more than 70 per\ncent energy requirement in rural households\nis met by these two ; continuation of these is\nincreasingly becoming dif ficult due to\ndecreasing for est ar ea. Mor eover , using dung\ncake too is being discouraged because it\nconsumes most valuable manure which could\nbe used in agriculture.\nConventional Sources of Energy\nCoal:  In India, coal is the most abundantly\navailable fossil fuel. It pr\novides a substantial\npart of the nation’s energy needs. It is used\nfor power generation, to supply energy to\nindustry as well as for domestic needs. India\nis highly dependent on coal for meeting its\ncommercial energy requirements.\nAs you ar e alr eady aware that coal is\nformed due the compression of plant material\nover millions of years. Coal, therefore, is\nfound in a variety of forms depending on the\ndegrees of compression and the depth andtime of burial. Decaying  plants in swamps\nproduce peat.  Which has a low carbon and\nhigh moisture contents and low heating\ncapacity. Lignite is a low grade brown coal,\nwhich is soft with high moisture content. The\nprincipal lignite r eserves ar e in Neyveli in T amil\nNadu and are used for generation of\nelectricity.

Digboi,\nNaharkatiya and Moran-Hugrijan ar e the\nimportant oil fields in the state.\nNatural Gas\nNatural Gas is found with petroleum deposits\nand is released when crude oil is brought to\nthe surface. It can be used as a domestic and\nindustrial fuel. It is used as fuel in power sector\nto generate electricity, for heating purpose in\nindustries, as raw material in chemical,\npetrochemical and fertilizer industries, as\ntransport fuel and as cooking fuel. With the\nexpansion of gas infrastructure and local citygas distribution (COD) networks, natural gas\nis also emerging as a preferred transport fuel\n(CNG) and cooking fuel (PNG) at homes.

Do\nyou know that paper is manufactured from\nwood, sugar from sugarcane, iron and steel\nfrom iron ore and aluminium from bauxite?\nDo you also know that some types of clothes\nare manufactured from yarn which itself is an\nindustrial product?\nPeople employed in the secondary activities\nmanufacture the primary materials into\nfinished goods. The workers employed in steel\nfactories, car , breweries, textile industries,\nbakeries etc. fall into this category. Some people\nare employed in providing services. In this\nchapter , we ar e mainly concer ned with\nmanufacturing industries which fall in the\nsecondary sector .\nThe economic strength of a country is\nmeasured by the development of\nmanufacturing industries.IMPOR TANCE OF MANUF ACTURING\nManufacturing sector is considered the backbone\nof development in general and economic\ndevelopment in particular mainly because –\n•Manufacturing industries not only help in\nmodernising agriculture, which forms the\nbackbone of our economy, they also reduce\nthe heavy dependence of people on\nagricultural income by providing them jobs\nin secondary and tertiary sectors.\n•Industrial development is a precondition for\neradication of unemployment and poverty\nfrom our country. This was the main\nphilosophy behind public sector industries\nand joint sector ventures in India. It was also\naimed at bringing down regional disparities\nby establishing industries in tribal and\nbackward areas.\n•Export of manufactured goods expands\ntrade and commerce, and brings in much\nneeded foreign exchange.\n•Countries that transform their raw\nmaterials into a wide variety of f inished\ngoods of higher value are prosperous.\nIndia’s prosperity lies in increasing and\ndiversifying its manufacturing industries as\nquickly as possible.\nAgriculture and industry are not exclusive\nof each other . They move hand in hand.  For\ninstance, the agro-industries in India have\ngiven a major boost to agriculture by raising\nits productivity.

It\nis the only industry in the country, which is\nself-reliant and complete in the value chain\ni.e., from raw material to the highest value\nadded products.\nCotton Textiles:  In ancient India, cotton\ntextiles were produced with hand spinning\nand handloom weaving techniques. After\nthe 18th century, power -looms came into\nuse.  Our traditional industries suffered a\nsetback during the colonial period because\nthey could not compete with the mill-made\ncloth from England.\nFig. 6.1:   Value addition in the textile industry\nIn the early years, the cotton textile\nindustry was concentrated in the cotton\ngrowing belt of Maharashtra and Gujarat.\nAvailability of raw cotton, market, transport\nincluding accessible port facilities, labour ,\nmoist climate, etc. contributed towards its\nlocalisation.  This industry has close links\nwith agriculture and provides a living to\nfarmers, cotton boll pluckers and workers\nengaged in ginning, spinning, weaving,dyeing, designing, packaging, tailoring and\nsewing. The industry by creating demands\nsupports many other industries, such as,\nchemicals and dyes , packaging materials\nand engineering works.\nWhile spinning continues to be centralised\nin Maharashtra, Gujarat and Tamil Nadu,\nweaving is highly decentralised to provide\nscope for incorporating traditional skills and\ndesigns of weaving in cotton, silk, zari,\nembroidery, etc. India has world class\nproduction in spinning, but weaving supplies\nlow quality of fabric as it cannot use much of\nthe high quality yarn produced in the country.\nWeaving is done by handloom, powerloom and\nin mills.\nThe handspun khadi provides large scale\nemployment to weavers in their homes as a\ncottage industry.\nWhy did Mahatma Gandhi lay emphasis on\nspinning yarn and weaving khadi?\nWhy is it important for our country to\nkeep the mill sector loomage lower than\npower loom and handloom?\nJute Textiles\nIndia is the largest producer of raw jute and\njute goods and stands at second place as an\nexporter after Bangladesh. Most of the mills are\nlocated in W est Bengal, mainly along the banks\nof the Hugli river , in a narr ow belt.\n•The first successful textile mill was\nestablished in Mumbai in 1854.\n•The two world wars were fought in Europe,\nIndia was a British colony .

Air -\nborne particulate materials contain both solid\nand liquid particles like dust, sprays mist and\nsmoke. Smoke is emitted by chemical and\npaper factories, brick kilns, refineries and\nsmelting plants, and burning of fossil fuels in\nbig and small factories that ignore pollution\nnorms. Toxic gas leaks can be very hazardous\nwith long-term effects. Are you aware of the\nBhopal Gas tragedy that occurred? Air\npollution adversely affects human health,\nanimals, plants, buildings and the atmosphere\nas a whole.\nWater pollution  is caused by or ganic and\ninorganic industrial wastes and affluents\ndischarged into rivers. The main culprits in this\nr\negard ar e paper , pulp, chemical, textile and\ndyeing, petroleum refineries, tanneries and\nelectroplating industries that let out dyes,\ndetergents, acids, salts and heavy metals like\nlead and mercury pesticides, fertilisers,\nsynthetic chemicals with carbon, plastics and\nrubber , etc. into the water bodies. Fly ash,\nphospo- gypsum and iron and steel slags are\nthe major solid wastes in India.\nThermal pollution  of water occurs when hot\nwater from factories and thermal plants is\ndrained into rivers and ponds before cooling.\nWhat would be the effect on aquatic life?\nWastes fr om nuclear power plants, nuclear\nand weapon production facilities cause\ncancers, birth defects and miscarriages. Soil\nand water pollution are closely related.Dumping of wastes specially glass, harmful\nchemicals, industrial effluents, packaging, salts\nand garbage renders the soil useless. Rain\nwater percolates to the soil carrying the\npollutants to the ground and the ground water\nalso gets contaminated.\nNoise pollution not only results in irritation\nand anger , it can also cause hearing\nimpairment, increased heart rate and blood\npressure among other physiological effects.\nUnwanted sound is an irritant and a source of\nstress.  Industrial and construction activities,\nmachinery, factory equipment, generators,\nsaws and pneumatic and electric drills also\nmake a lot of noise.\nControl of Environmental Degradation\nEvery litre of waste water discharged by our\nindustry pollutes eight times the quantity of\nfreshwater . How can the industrial pollution of\nfresh water be reduced? Some suggestions  are-\n(i)minimising use water for processing by\nreusing and recycling it in two or more\nsuccessive stages\n(ii)harvesting of rainwater to meet water\nrequirements\n(iii)treating hot water and  effluents before\nreleasing them in rivers and ponds.\nT\nreatment of industrial ef fluents can be\ndone in three phases\n(a)Primary treatment by mechanical means.\nThis involves screening, grinding,\nflocculation and sedimentation.\n(b)Secondary treatment by biological process\n(c)Tertiary treatment by biological,\nchemical and physical processes. This\ninvolves r ecycling of wastewater .\nOverdrawing of ground water reserves by\nindustry where there is a threat to ground\nwater resources also needs to be regulated\nlegally. Particulate matter in the air can be\nreduced by fitting smoke stacks to factories\nwith electrostatic precipitators, fabric filters,\nscrubbers and inertial separators. Smoke\ncan be reduced by using oil or gas instead\nReprint 2024-25"

The growing importance of\nroad transport vis-à-vis rail transport is\nrooted in the following reasons; (a)\nconstruction cost of roads is much lower\nthan that of railway lines, (b) roads can\ntraverse comparatively more dissected and\nundulating topography, (c) roads can\nnegotiate higher gradients of slopes and as\nsuch can traverse mountains such as the\nHimalayas, (d) road transport is economical\nin transportation o f few persons and\nrelatively smaller amount of goods over\nshort distances, (e) it also pr ovides door -\nto-door service, thus the cost of loading\nand unloading is much lower , (f) r oad\ntransport is also used as a feeder to other\nmodes of transport such as they provide a\nlink between railway stations, air and\nsea ports.\nIn India, roads are classified in the\nfollowing six classes a ccording to their\ncapacity. Look at the map of the National\nHighways and find out about the significant\nrole played by these roads.\n•Golden Quadrilateral Super Highways:\nThe government has launched a major\nroad development project linking Delhi-\nKolkata-Chennai-Mumbai and Delhi by\nsix-lane Super Highways. The North-\nSouth corridors linking Srinagar (Jammu\n& Kashmir) and Kanniyakumari (T amil\nNadu), and East-W est Corridor\nconnecting Silchar (Assam) and Porbander\n(Gujarat) ar e part of this pr oject. The\nmajor objective of these Super Highways\nis to reduce the time and distance\nbetween the mega cities of India. These\nhighway projects are being implemented\nby the National Highway Authority of\nIndia (NHAI).\n•National Highways:  National Highways\nlink extr eme parts of the country. These\nare the primary road systems. A number\nof major National Highways run in North-\nSouth and East-W est dir ections.\n•State Highways:  Roads linking a state\ncapital with different district headquarters\nare known as State Highways.\n•District Roads:  These roads connect the\ndistrict headquarters with other places of\nthe district.\n•Other Roads:  Rural roads, which link rural\nareas and villages with towns, are classified\nunder this category. These r oads r eceived\nspecial impetus under the Pradhan Mantri\nGrameen Sadak Y ojana . Under this scheme\nspecial provisions are made so that every\nvillage in the country is linked to a major\ntown in the country by an all season\nmotorable road.\n•Border Roads:  Apart from these, Border\nRoads Organisation a Government of India\nundertaking constructs and maintains\nroads in the bordering areas of the\ncountry. This organisation was established\nin 1960 for the development of the roads\nof strategic importance in the northern and\nnorth-eastern border areas.
