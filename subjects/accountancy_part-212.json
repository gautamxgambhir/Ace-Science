Its\ncapital is contributed by a large number of personscalled shareholders who are the real owners of the\ncompany. But neither it is possible for all of them to\nparticipate in the management of the company nor\nconsidered desirable. Therefore, they elect a Board\nof Directors as their representative to manage the\naffairs of the company. In fact, all the affairs of the\ncompany are governed by the provisions of the\nCompanies Act, 2013. A company means a companyincorporated or registered under the Companies Act,\n2013 or under any other earlier Companies Acts.\nAccording to Chief Justice Marshal, “a company is\na person, artificial, invisible, intangible and existing\nonly in the eyes of law. Being a mere creation of law,\nit possesses only those properties which the charter\nof its creation confers upon it, either expressly or as\nincidental to its very existence”.\nA company usually raises its capital in the form of\nshares (called share capital) and debentures (debt\ncapital.) This chapter deals with the accounting for\nshare capital of companies.\n1.1 Features of a Company\nA company may be viewed as an association of\nperson who contribute money or money’s worth to\na common inventory and use it for a common\npurpose. It is an artificial person having  corporate\nlegal entity distinct from its members (shareholders)\nand has a common seal used for its signature. Thus,LEARNING  OBJECTIVES\nAfter studying this chapter ,\nyou will be able to :\n• explain the basic nature\nof a joint stock company\nas a form of businessorganisation and thevarious kinds ofcompanies based onliability of theirmembers;\n• describe the types of\nshares issued by acompany;\n• explain the accounting\ntreatment of sharesissued at par , atpremium and atdiscount includingoversubsription;\n• outline the accounting\nfor  forfeiture of sharesand reissue of forfeitedshares under varyingsituations;\n• workout the amounts to\nbe transferred to capitalreserve when forfeitedshares are reissued; andprepare share forfeitedaccount ;Accounting for Share Capital 1\n2024-25"

These are as follows:\n•Body Corporate: A company is formed according to the provisions of\nLaw enforced from time to time. Generally, in India, the companies areformed and registered under Companies Law except in the case of Banking\nand Insurance companies for which a separate Law is provided for.\n•Separate Legal Entity:  A company has a separate legal entity which is\ndistinct and separate from its members. It can hold and deal with anytype of property. It can enter into contracts and even open a bank account\nin its own name.\n•Limited Liability:  The liability of the members of the company is limited\nto the extent of unpaid amount of the shares held by them. In the case ofthe companies limited by guarantee, the liability of its members is limitedto the extent of the guarantee given by them in the event of the company\nbeing wound up.\n•Perpetual Succession:  The company being an artificial person created by\nlaw continues to exist irrespective of the changes in its membership. Acompany can be terminated only through law. The death or insanity or\ninsolvency of any member of the company in no way affects the existence ofthe company. Members may come and go but the company continues.\n•Common Seal:  The company being an artificial person, cannot sign its name\nby itself. Therefore, every company is required to have its own seal whichacts as official signatures of the company. Any document which does not\ncarry the common seal of the company is not binding on the company.\n•Transferability of Shares:  The shares of a public limited company are\nfreely transferable. The permission of the company or the consent of anymember of the company is not necessary for the transfer of shares. But\nthe Articles of the company can prescribe the manner in which the transferof shares will be made.\n•May Sue or be Sued:  A company being a legal person can enter into\ncontracts and can enforce the contractual rights against others. It cansue and be sued in its name if there is a breach of contract by the company.\n1.2 Kinds of Companies\nCompanies can be classified either on the basis of the liability of its members\nor on the basis of the number of members. On the basis of liability of its\nmembers the companies can be classified into the following three categories:\n(i)Companies Limited by Shares:  In this case, the liability of its members\nis limited to the extent of the nominal value of shares held by them. If\na member has paid the full amount of the shares, there is no liability\non his part whatsoever may be for the debts of the company. He need\nnot pay a single paise from his private property.

Thus, the liability of the members will\narise only in the event of its winding up.\n(iii) Unlimited Companies:  When there is no limit on the liability of its\nmembers, the company is called an unlimited company. When the\ncompany’s property is not sufficient to pay off its debts, the private\nproperty of its members can be used for the purpose. In other words,\nthe creditors can claim their dues from its members. Such companies\nare not found in India even though permitted by the Companies Act.\nOn the basis of the number of members, companies can be divided into\nthree categories as follows:\n(i)Public Company : A public company means a company which (a) is not\na private company; (b) is a company which is not a subsidiary of a\nprivate company.\n(ii) Private Company : A private company is one which by its articles of\nassociation:\n(a) Restricts the right to transfer its shares;\n(b) A private company must have at least 2 persons, except in case\nof one person company;\n(c) Limits the number of its members to 200 (excluding its\nemployees);\n(iii) One Person Company (OPC) : Sec. 2 (62) of the companies Act, 2013,\ndefines OPC as a “company which has only one person as a member”.\nRule 3 of the Companies (Incorporation) Rules, 2014 provides that:\n(a) Only a natural person being an Indian citizen and resident in\nIndia can form one person company,\n(b) It cannot carry out non-banking financial investment activities.\n(c) Its paid up share capital is not more than Rs. 50 Lakhs\n(d) Its average annual turnover of three years does not exceed\nRs. 2 Crores.\n1.3 Share Capital of a Company\nA company, being an artificial person, cannot generate its own capital which\nhas necessarily to be collected from several persons. These persons are known\nas shareholders and the amount contributed by them is called share capital.\nSince the number of shareholders is very very large, a separate capital account\ncannot be opened for each one of them. Hence, innumerable streams of capital\ncontribution merge their identities in a common capital account called as\n‘Share Capital Account’.\n2024-25"

                "text": "4 Accountancy : Company Accounts and Analysis of Financial Statements\n1.3.1 Categories of Share Capital\nFrom accounting point of view the share capital of the company can be classified\nas follows:\n•Authorised Capital:  Authorised capital is the amount of share capital which\na company is authorised to issue by its Memorandum of Association. The\ncompany cannot raise more than the amount of capital as specified in theMemorandum of Association. It is also called Nominal or Registered capital.The authorised capital can be increased or decreased as per the procedurelaid down in the Companies Act. It should be noted that the company neednot issue the entire authorised capital for public subscription at a time.Depending upon its requirement, it may issue share capital but in anycase, it should not be more than the amount of authorised capital.\n•Issued Capital:  It is that part of the authorised capital which is actually\nissued to the public for subscription including the shares allotted to vendorsand the signatories to the company’s memorandum. The authorised capitalwhich is not offered for public subscription is known as ‘unissued capital’.Unissued capital may be offered for public subscription at a later date.\n•Subscribed Capital:  It is that part of the issued capital which has been\nactually subscribed by the public. When the shares offered for publicsubscription are subscribed fully by the public the issued capital andsubscribed capital would be the same. It may be noted that ultimately,the subscribed capital may be equal to or less than issued capital. Incase the number of shares subscribed is less than what is offered, thecompany allots only the number of shares for which subscription hasbeen received. In case it is higher than what is offered, the allotmentwill be equal to the offer. In other words, the fact of over subscription isnot reflected in the books.\n•Called up Capital:  It is that part of the subscribed capital which has been\ncalled up on the shares, i.e., what the company has asked the shareholdersto pay. The company may decide to call the entire amount or part of theface value of the shares, For example, if the face value (also called nominalvalue) of a share allotted is Rs. 10 and the company has called up only Rs.7 per share, in that scenario, the called up capital is Rs. 7 per share. Theremaining Rs. 3 may be collected from its shareholders as and when needed.\n•Paid up Capital:  It is that portion of the called up capital which has been\nactually received from the shareholders. When the shareholders have paidall the called amount, the called up capital is the same to the paid upcapital. If any of the shareholders has not paid amount on calls, such anamount may be called as ‘calls in arrears’. Therefore, paid up capital isequal to the called-up capital minus call in arrears.\n•Uncalled Capital:  That portion of the subscribed capital which has not yet\nbeen called up. As stated earlier, the company may collect this amount\nany time when it needs further funds.\n2024-25"

The company received applications for\n2,50,000 shares. The company finalised the allotment of 2,00,000 shares\nand rejected applications for 50,000 shares. The company did not make the\nfinal call.

Thus, a share is a fractional part of the share capital and forms thebasis of ownership interest in a company. The persons who contribute moneythrough shares are called shareholders.\nThe amount of authorised capital, together with the number of shares in\nwhich it is divided, is stated in the Memorandum of Association but the classesof shares in which the company’s capital is to be divided, along with theirrespective rights and obligations, are prescribed by the Articles of Association\nof the company. As per The Companies Act, a company can issue two typesof shares (1) preference shares, and (2) equity shares (also called ordinaryshares).\n1.4.1 Preference Shares\nAccording to Section 43 of The Companies Act, 2013, a preference share is one,\nwhich fulfils the following conditions :\n(a) That it carries a preferential right to dividend to be paid either as a\nfixed amount payable to preference shareholders or an amount\ncalculated by a fixed rate of the nominal value of each share before\nany dividend is paid to the equity shareholders.\n(b) That with respect to capital it carries or will carry, on the winding up\nof the company, the preferential right to the repayment of capital before\nanything is paid to equity shareholders.\nHowever, notwithstanding the above two conditions, a holder of the\npreference share may have a right to participate fully or to a limited extent inthe surpluses of the company as specified in the Memorandum or Articles ofthe company. Thus, the preference shares can be participating and non-\nparticipating. Similarly, these shares can be cumulative or non-cumulative, and\nredeemable or irredeemable.\n1.4.2 Equity Shares\nAccording to Section 43 of The Companies Act, 2013, an equity share is a share\nwhich is not a preference share. In other words, shares which do not enjoy anypreferential right in the payment of dividend or repayment of capital, are termed\nas equity/ordinary shares. The equity shareholders are entitled to share the\ndistributable profits of the company after satisfying the dividend rights of thepreference share holders. The dividend on equity shares is not fixed and itmay vary from year to year depending upon the amount of profits available\n2024-25"

The first instalment is\ncollected along with application and is thus, known as application money, the\nsecond on allotment (termed as allotment money), and the remaining instalments\nare termed as first call, second call and so on. The word final is suffixed to the\nlast instalment. However, this in no way which prevents a company from\ncalling the full amount on shares right at the time of application.\nThe important steps in the procedure of share issue are :\n•Issue of Prospectus:  The company first issues the prospectus to the\npublic. Prospectus is an invitation to the public that a new company hascome into existence and it needs funds for doing business. It contains\ncomplete information about the company and the manner in which the\nmoney is to be collected from the prospective investors.\n•Receipt of Applications:  When prospectus is issued to the public,\nprospective investors intending to subscribe the share capital of the\ncompany would make an application along with the application money\n2024-25"

The company has to get minimum subscription  within 120\ndays from the date of the issue of the prospectus. If the company fails to\nreceive the same within the said period, the company cannot proceed forthe allotment of shares and application money should be returned within130 days of the date of issue of prospectus.\n•Allotment of Shares:  If minimum subscription has been received, the\ncompany may proceed for the allotment of shares after fulfilling certainother legal formalities. Letters of allotment are sent to those whom the\nshares have been alloted, and letters of regret to those to whom no\nallotment has been made. When allotment is made, it results in a valid\ncontract between the company and the applicants who now became the\nshareholders of the company.\nMinimum Subscription\nThe minimum amount that, in the opinion of directors, must be raised to meet the\nneeds of business operations of the company relating to:\nthe price of any property purchased, or to be purchased, which has to be metwholly or partly out of the proceeds of issue;\npreliminary expenses payable by the company and any commission payablein connection with the issue of shares;\nthe repayment of any money borrowed by the company for the above twomatters;\nworking capital; and\nany other expenditure required for the usual conduct of business operations.\nIt is to be noted that ‘minimum subscription’ of capital cannot be less than 90%of the issued amount according to SEBI (Disclosure and Investor Protection)Guidelines, 2000 [6.3.8.1 and 6.3.8.2]. If this condition is not satisfied, the companyshall forthwith refund the entire subscription amount received. If a delay occurs\nbeyond 8 days from the date of closure of subscription list, the company shall be\nliable to pay the amount with interest at the rate of 15% [Section 73(2)].\nShares of a company are issued either at par or at a premium.  Shares are  to\nbe issued at par when their issue price is exactly equal to their nominal value\naccording to the terms and conditions of issue. When the shares of a company\nare issued more than its nominal value (face value), the excess amount is\ncalled premium.\n2024-25"

This usually happens in\nrespect of shares issue of well-managed and financially strong companies and\nis said to be a case of ‘Over Subscription’.\nIn such a condition, three alternatives are available to the directors to deal\nwith the situation: (1) they can accept some applications in full and totally reject\nthe others;  (2) they can make a pro-rata allotment to all; and  (3) they can adopt\na combination of the above two alternatives which happens to be the most\ncommon course adopted in practice.\nThe problem of over subscription is resolved with the allotment of shares.\nTherefore, from the accounting point of view, it is better to place the situation of\nover subscription within the total frame of application and allotment, i.e. receipt\nof application amount, amount due on allotment and its receipt from the\nshareholders, and the same has been observed in the pattern of entries.\nFirst Alternative : When the directors decide to fully accept some applications\nand totally reject the others, the application money received on rejected\napplications is fully refunded. For example, a company invited applications for\n20,000 shares and received the applications for 25,000 shares. The directorsrejected the applications for 5,000 shares which are in excess of the required\nnumber and refunded their application money in full.

In case,\nthe excess application money received is more than the amount due on allotment\nof shares, such excess amount may either be refunded or credited to calls in\nadvance.\nFor example, in the event of applications for 20,000 shares being invited\nand those received are for 25,000 shares, it is decieded to allot shares in the\nratio of 4:5 to all applicants. It is a case of pro-rata allotment and the excess\napplication money received on 5,000 shares would be adjusted towards the\namount due on the allotment of 20,000 shares.

It\ncan do so only in cases such as ‘reissue of forfeited shares’ (to be discussed later)\nand issue of sweat equity shares.\n1.6.7 Issue of Shares for Consideration other than Cash\nThere are instances where a company enters into an arrangement with the\nvendors from whom it has purchased assets, whereby the latter agrees to accept,\nthe payment in the form of fully paid shares of the company issued to them.\nNormally, no such cash is received for issue of shares. These shares can also be\nissued either at par, at premium or at discount, and the number of shares to be\nissued  will depend upon the price at which the shares are issued and the amount\npayable to the vendor.  The number of shares to be issued to the vendor will be\ncalculated as follows:\nAmount PayableNumber of shares to be issued=\n    Issue Price\nFor example, Rahul Limited purchased building from Handa Limited for\nRs.5,40,000 and the payment is to be made by the issue of shares of Rs.100each.

In such circumstances, the company\ncan forfeit their shares, i.e. cancel their allotment and treat the amount already\nreceived thereon as forfeited to the company within the framework of theprovisions in its articles. These provisions are usually based on  Table F\nwhich authorise the directors to forefeit the shares for non-payment of calls\nmade. For this purpose, they have to strictly follow the procedure laid downin this regard. Following is the accounting treatment of shares issued at par,\npremium or at a discount. When shares are forefeited all entries relating to\nthe shares forfeited except those relating to premium, already recorded inthe accounting records must be reversed. Accordingly, share capital account\nis debited with the amount called-up in respect of shares are forfeited and\ncrediting the respective unpaid calls accounts’s or calls in arrears accountwith the amount already received.

Issue of Shares for Consideration\nOther than Cash\nSummary\nCompany:  An organisation consisting of individuals called ‘shareholders’ by virtue\nof their holding the shares of a company, who can act as legal person as regardsits business through board of directors.\nShare:  Fractional part of the capital, and forms the basis of ownership in a company.\nShares are generally of two types, viz. equity shares and preference shares,\naccording to the provisions of the Companies Act, 2013. Preference shares again\nare of different types based on varying shades of rights attached to them.\nShare Capital of a company is collected by issuing shares to either a select\ngroup of persons through the route of private placements and/or offered to the\npublic for subscription. Thus, the issue of shares is basic to the capital of a\ncompany. Shares are issued either for cash or for consideration other than\ncash, the former being more common. Shares are said to be issued for\nconsideration other than cash when a company purchases business, or some\nasset/assets, and the vendors have agreed to receive payment in the form of\nfully paid shares of a company.\nStages of Share Issue: The issue of shares for cash is required to be made in strict\nconformity with the procedure laid down by law for the same. When shares are\nissued for cash, the amount on them can be collected at one or more of the following\nstages:\n(i) Application for shares\n(ii) Allotment of shares\n(iii) Call/Calls on shares.\n2024-25"

                "text": "66 Accountancy : Company Accounts and Analysis of Financial Statements\nCalls in Arrears: Sometimes, the full amount called on allotment and/or call (calls)\nis not received from the allottees/shareholders. The amount not so received are\ncumulatively called ‘Unpaid calls’ or ‘Calls in Arrears’. However, it is not mandatoryfor a company to maintain a separate Calls-in-Arrears Account. There are alsoinstances where some shareholders consider it discreet to pay a part or whole of\nthe amount not yet called-up on the shares allotted to them. Any amount paid by\na shareholder in the excess of the amount due from him on allotment/call (calls) isknown as ‘Calls in Advance’ for which a separate account is maintained. A companyhas the power to charge interest on calls in  arrears and is under an obligation to\npay interest on calls-in-advance if it accepts them in accordance with the provisions\nof Articles of Association.\nOver Subscription: It is possible for the shares of some companies to be over\nsubscribed which means that applications for more shares are received than the\nnumber offered for subscription.\nIf the amount of minimum subscription is not received to the extent of 90%, the\nissue dissolves. In case the applications received are less than the number of\nshares offered to the public, the issue is termed as ‘under subscribed’.\nIssue of Shares at Premium: Irrespective of the fact that shares have been issued\nfor consideration other than cash, they can be issued either at par or at premium.\nThe issue of shares at par implies that the shares have been issued for an amountexactly equal to their face or nominal value. In case shares are issued  at a premium,\ni.e. at an amount more than the nominal or par value of shares, the amount of\npremium is credited to a separate account called ‘Securities Premium ReserveAccount’, the use of which is strictly regulated by law.\nIssue of Shares at Discount: Shares can as well be issued at a discount, i.e. for an\namount less than the nominal or par value of shares provided the company fully\ncomplies with the provisions laid down by law with regard to the same. Apart fromsuch compliance, shares of a company cannot ordinarily be issued at a discount.\nAccording to the Companies Act, 2013, only sweat equity shares can be issued at\na discount. When shares are issued at a discount, the amount of discount is debitedto ‘Discount on Issue of Share Account’, which is in the nature of capital loss forthe company.\nForfeiture of Shares: Sometimes, shareholders fail to pay one or more instalments\non shares allotted to them. In such a case, the company has the authority to\nforfeit shares of the defaulters. This is called ‘Forfeiture of Shares’. Forfeituremeans the cancellation of allotment due to breach of contract and to treat the\namount already received on such shares as forfeited to the company. The precise\naccounting treatment of share forfeiture depends upon the conditions on whichthe shares have been issued — at par, premium or discount. Generally speaking,accounting treatment on forfeiture is to reverse the entries passed till the stage\nof forfeiture, the amount already received on the shares being credited to Forfeiture\nShares Account.\n2024-25"

But the funds raised by the issue of\nshares are seldom adequate to meet their long term\nfinancial needs of a company. Hence, most companiesturn to raising long-term funds also through\ndebentures which are issued either through the route\nof private placement or by offering the same to thepublic. The finances raised through debentures arealso known as long-term debt.  This chapter deals withthe accounting treatment of issue and redemption ofdebentures and other related aspects.\nSECTION  I\n2.1 Meaning of Debentures\nDebenture : The word ‘debenture’ has been derived\nfrom a Latin word ‘debere’ which means to borrow.\nDebenture is a written instrument acknowledging adebt under the common seal of the company.  Itcontains a contract for repayment of principal aftera specified period or at intervals or at the option of\nthe company and for payment of interest at a fixed\nrate payable usually either half-yearly or yearly onfixed dates. According to section 2(30) of TheCompanies Act, 2013 ‘Debenture’ includesDebenture Inventory, Bonds and any othersecurities of a company whether constituting acharge on the assets of the company or not.LEARNING  OBJECTIVES\nAfter studying this chapter\nyou will be able to :\n•state the meaning of\ndebenture and explain the\ndifference between\ndebentures and shares;\n•describe various types of\ndebentures;\n•record the journal entries\nfor the issue of debentures\nat par, at a discount and\nat premium;\n•explain the concept of\ndebentures issued forconsideration other thancash and the accounting\nthereof;\n•explain the concept of\nissue of debentures as acollateral security and the\naccounting thereof;\n•record the journal entries for\nissue of debentures withvarious terms of issue,terms of redemption;\n•show the items relating to\nissue of debentures incompany’s balance sheet;\n•describe the methods of\nwriting-off discount/losson issue of debentures;\n•explain the methods\nof redemption ofdebentures and the\naccounting thereof; and\n•explain the concept of\nsinking fund, its use forredemption of debentures\nand the accountingthereof.Issue and Redemption of Debentures 2\n2024-25"

Traditionally,\nthe Government issued bonds, but these days, bonds are also being issued by\nsemi-government and non-governmental organisations. The terms ‘debentures’\nand ‘Bonds’ are now being used inter-changeably.\n2.2 Distinction between Shares and Debentures\nOwnership : A ‘share’ represents ownership of the company whereas a debenture\nis only acknowledgement of Debt. A share is a part of the owned capital whereas\na debenture is a part of borrowed capital.\nReturn: The return on shares is known as dividend while the return on\ndebentures is called interest. The rate of return on shares may vary from year to\nyear depending upon the profits of the company but the rate of interest ondebentures is prefixed. The payment of dividend is an appropriation of profits,\nwhereas the payment of interest is a charge on profits and is to be paid even if\nthere is no profit.\nRepayment:  Normally, the amount of shares is not returned during the life of\nthe company, whereas, generally, the debentures are issued for a specified period\nand repayable on the expiry of that period.\nVoting Rights:  Shareholders enjoy voting rights whereas debentureholders do\nnot normally enjoy any voting right.Security :  Shares are not secured by any charge whereas the debentures are\ngenerally secured and carry a fixed or floating charge over the assets of the\ncompany.\nConvertibility:  Shares cannot be converted into debentures whereas debentures\ncan be converted into shares if the terms of issue so provide, and in that case\nthese are known as convertible debentures.\n2.3 Types of Debentures\nA company may issue different kinds of debentures which can be classified as\nunder:\n2.3.1 From the Point of view of Security\n(a) Secured Debentures : Secured debentures refer to those debentures\nwhere a charge is created on the assets of the company for the purpose\nof payment in case of default. The charge may be fixed or floating.  A\nfixed charge is created on a specific asset whereas a floating charge is\n2024-25"

The fixed charge is created\nagainst those assets which are held by a company for use in operations\nnot meant for sale whereas floating charge involves all assets excluding\nthose assigned to the secured creditors.\n(b) Unsecured Debentures : Unsecured debentures do not have a specific\ncharge on the assets of the company. However, a floating charge may\nbe created on these debentures by default. Normally, these kinds of\ndebentures are not issued.\n2.3.2 From the Point of view of Tenure\n(a) Redeemable Debentures: Redeemable debentures are those which\nare payable on the expiry of the specific period either in lump sumor in Instalments during the life time of the company. Debentures\ncan be redeemed either at par or at premium.\n(b) Irredeemable Debentures: Irredeemable debentures are also known\nas Perpetual Debentures because the company does not give any\nundertaking for the repayment of money borrowed by issuing suchdebentures.  These debentures are repayable on the winding-up of a\ncompany or on the expiry of a long period.\n2.3.3 From the Point of view of Convertibility\n(a) Convertible Debentures: Debentures which are convertible into equity\nshares or in any other security either at the option of the company or\nthe debentureholders are called convertible debentures. These\ndebentures are either fully convertible or partly convertible.\n(b) Non-Convertible Debentures:  The debentures which cannot be\nconverted into shares or in any other securities are called non-\nconvertible debentures. Most debentures issued by companies fall in\nthis category.\n2.3.4 From Coupon Rate Point of view\n(a) Specific Coupon Rate Debentures : These debentures are issued with\na specified rate of interest, which is called the coupon rate. The specifiedrate may either be fixed or floating. The floating interest rate is usually\ntagged with the bank rate.\n(b) Zero Coupon Rate Debentures : These debentures do not carry a\nspecific rate of interest. In order to compensate the investors, such\ndebentures are issued at substantial discount and the difference\nbetween the nominal value and the issue price is treated as the\namount of interest related to the duration of the debentures.\n2024-25"

Such debentures can be transferred only byexecuting a regular transfer deed.\n(b) Bearer Debentures : Bearer debentures are the debentures which can\nbe transferred by way of delivery and the company does not keepany record of the debentures Interest on debentures is paid to aperson who produces the interest coupon attached to suchdebentures.\n2.4 Issue of Debentures\nThe procedure for the issue of debentures is the same as that for the issue of\nshares. The intending investors apply for debentures on the basis of the prospectus\nissued by the company. The company may either ask for the entire amount to be\npaid on application or by means of instalments on application, on allotment and\non various calls.

In such situation, the company may issue its own debentures to the\nlenders in addition to some other assets already pledged. Such an issue of\ndebentures is known as ‘Debentures issued as Collateral Security’.\nIf the company fails to repay the loan along with interest, the lender is free to\nreceive his money from the sale of primary security and if the realisable value of\nthe primary security falls short to cover the entire amount, the lender has the\nright to invoke the benefit of collateral security whereby debentures may either\nbe presented for redemption or sold in the open market.\nDebentures issued as collateral security can be dealt within two ways in the\nbooks of the company:\nFirst Method\nNo entry is made in the books of accounts since no liability is created by such\nissue.

In other words\nredemption of debentures means repayment of the amount of debentures by\nthe company. There are four ways by which the debentures can be redeemed.\nThese are :\n1. Payment in lump sum\n2. Payment in instalments\n3. Purchase in the open market\n4. By conversion into shares or new debentures.\nMethods of Redemption of Debentures\nPayment in Payment in Purchase in Conversion  into Shares\nLump sum Instalments Open Market or New Debentures\nPayment in lump sum :   The company redeems the debentures by paying the\namount in lump sum to the debentureholders at the maturity thereof as per\nterms of issue.\nPayment in instalments  :  Under this method, normally redemption of\ndebentures is made in instalments on the specified date during the tenure of\nthe debentures.  The total amount of debenture liability is divided by the\nnumber of years. It is to note that the actual debentures redeemable are\nidentified by means of drawing the requisite number of lots out of the debentures\noutstanding for payment.\nPurchase in open market:   When a  company purchases its own debentures\nfor the purposes of cancellation, such an act of purchasing and cancelling the\ndebentures constitutes redemption of debentures by purchase in the open\nmarket.\nConversion into shares or new debentures :  A company can redeem its\ndebentures by converting them into shares or new class of debentures. If\ndebentureholders find that the offer is beneficial to them, they can exercise their\nright of converting their debentures into shares or new class of debentures.\n2024-25"

It is a loan capital raised by the\ncompany from general public. A person/holder of such a written acknowledgement is called\n‘debenture holder’.\nBond: Bond is similar to debenture in terms of contents and texture. The only difference is\nwith respect of issue condition, i.e, bonds can be issued without pre-determined rate of\ninterest as it is in case of deep discount bonds.\nCharge: Charge is an incumbrance to meet the obligation under trust deed on certain\nassets which company agrees to mortgage either by way of first or second charge. First\ncharge implies the priority in repayment of loan. Those who hold first charge against anyspecific asset will realise their claim from the net realisable value of such assets. Anyamount of surplus from such assets given under first charge will be utilised for setting theclaims for holder of second charge.\nTypes of Debenture: Debentures are of various types such as: secured and unsecured\ndebentures redeemable and perpetual debentures, convertible and non-convertible\ndebentures, zero coupon rate and specific rate, registered and bearer debentures.\nIssue of Debenture: Debentures are said to be issued at par when the amount to be collected\non them is equal to their nominal or face value. If the issue price is more than nominal or\nface value, it is said to be issued at a premium. If the issue price is less than the nominalor face value, it is said to be issued on discount. The amount received as premium iscredited to ‘securities premium account’ whereas amount of discount allowed is debited to“loss/discount on issue” and is written-off over the years\nIssue of Debentures for consideration other than Cash:  Sometimes debentures can be issued\nto vendor or suppliers of patents, copyrights and for transfer of intellectual property rights\non preferential basis without receiving money in cash.\nPurchase Consideration:  Purchase consideration is amount paid by purchasing company in\nconsideration for purchase of assets/business firm, another enterprise/vendor.Collateral Security:  Any security in addition to primary security is called ‘collateral security’.\nRedemption of Debenture: Means discharge of liability on account of debenture/bond by\nrepayment made to debenture holders Normally, the redemption takes place on the expiry of\nperiod for which they have been issued, depending upon the terms and conditions of issue.\nQuestions for Practice\nShort Answer Questions\n1.

The originalcost or historical cost is the basis of recording transactions. The figures\nof various accounts such as cash in hand, cash at bank, trade\nreceivables, fixed assets, etc., are taken as per the figures recorded in\nthe accounting books. The assets purchased at different times and at\ndifferent prices are put together and shown at costs. As these are not\nbased on market prices, the financial statements do not show currentfinancial condition of the concern.\n2.Accounting Conventions:  Certain accounting conventions are followed\nwhile preparing financial statements. The convention of valuing\ninventory at cost or market price, whichever is lower, is followed. The\nvaluing of assets at cost less depreciation principle for balance sheet\npurposes is followed. The convention of materiality is followed in dealingwith small items like pencils, pens, postage stamps, etc. These items\nare treated as expenditure in the year in which they are purchased\neven though they are assets in nature. The stationery is valued at cost\nand not on the principle of cost or market price, whichever is less. The\nuse of accounting conventions makes financial statements comparable,\nsimple and realistic.\n3.Postulates: Financial statements are prepared on certain basic\nassumptions (pre-requisites) known as postulates such as going\nconcern postulate, money measurement postulate, realisation\npostulate, etc. Going concern postulate assumes that the enterprise is\ntreated as a going concern and exists for a longer period of time. So the\nassets are shown on historical cost basis. Money measurement\npostulate assumes that the value of money will remain the same in\ndifferent periods. Though there is drastic change in purchasing power\nof money, the assets purchased at different times will be shown at\n2024-25"

While, preparing statement of profit and\nloss the revenue is included in the sales of the year in which the sale\nwas undertaken even though the sale price may be received over a\nnumber of years. The assumption is known as realisation postulate.\n4.Personal Judgements:  Under more than one circumstance, facts and\nfigures presented through financial statements are based on personal\nopinion, estimates and judgements. The depreciation is provided taking\ninto consideration the useful economic life of fixed assets. Provisions\nfor doubtful debts are made on estimates and personal judgements.\nIn valuing inventory, cost or market value, whichever is less is being\nfollowed. While deciding either cost of inventory or market value of\ninventory, many personal judgements are to be made based on certain\nconsiderations. Personal opinion, judgements and estimates are made\nwhile preparing the financial statements to avoid any possibility of\nover statement of assets and liabilities, income and expenditure,\nkeeping in mind the convention of conservatism.\nThus, financial statements are the summarised reports of recorded facts\nand are prepared the following accounting concepts, conventions, accounting\npolicies, accounting standards and requirements of Law.\n3.3 Objectives of Financial Statements\nFinancial statements are the basic sources of information to the shareholders\nand other external parties for understanding the profitability and financial\nposition of any business concern. They provide information about the results of\nthe business concern during a specified period of time in terms of assets and\nliabilities, which provide the basis for taking decisions. Thus, the primary\nobjective of financial statements is to assist the users in their decision-making.\nThe specific objectives include the following:\n1.To provide information about economic resources and obligations ofa business:  They are prepared to provide adequate, reliable and\nperiodical information about economic resources and obligations of abusiness firm to investors and other external parties who have limited\nauthority, ability or resources to obtain information.\n2.To provide information about the earning capacity of the business:They are to provide useful financial information which can gainfully\nbe utilised to predict, compare and evaluate the business firm’s earning\ncapacity.\n3.To provide information about cash flows:  They are to provide\ninformation useful to investors and creditors for predicting, comparing\nand evaluating, potential cash flows in terms of amount, timing and\nrelated uncertainties.\n2024-25"

In this chapter we will have anoverview of these techniques.\n4.1  Meaning of Analysis of Financial Statements\nThe process of critical evaluation of the financial\ninformation contained in the financial statements in\norder to understand and make decisions regarding\nthe operations of the firm is called ‘Financial\nStatement Analysis’. It is basically a study of\nrelationship among various financial facts and\nfigures as given in a set of financial statements, and\nthe interpretation thereof to gain an insight into the\nprofitability and operational efficiency of the firm to\nassess its financial health and future prospects.\nThe term ‘financial analysis’ includes both\n‘analysis and interpretation’. The term analysis\nmeans simplification of financial data by methodical\nclassification given in the financial statements.\nInterpretation means explaining the meaning and\nsignificance of the data. These two are\ncomplimentary to each other.

It essentially involves regroupingand analysis of information provided by financial statements to establishrelationships and throw light on the points of strengths and weaknesses of abusiness enterprise, which can be useful in decision-making involving comparisonwith other firms (cross sectional analysis) and with firms’ own performance,over a time period (time series analysis).\n4.2 Significance of Analysis of Financial Statements\nFinancial analysis is the process of identifying the financial strengths and\nweaknesses of the firm by properly establishing relationships between the various\nitems of the balance sheet and the statement of profit and loss. Financial analysis\ncan be undertaken by management of the firm, or by parties outside the firm,\nviz., owners, trade creditors, lenders, investors, labour unions, analysts and\nothers. The nature of analysis will differ depending on the purpose of the analyst.\nA technique frequently used by an analyst need not necessarily serve the purpose\nof other analysts because of the difference in the interests of the analysts.Financial analysis is useful and significant to different users in the following\nways:\n(a) Finance manager: Financial analysis focusses on the facts and\nrelationships related to managerial performance, corporate efficiency,\nfinancial strengths and weaknesses and creditworthiness of the company.A finance manager must be well-equipped with the different tools ofanalysis to make rational decisions for the firm. The tools for analysishelp in studying accounting data so as to determine the continuity of the\noperating policies, investment value of the business, credit ratings and\ntesting the efficiency of operations. The techniques are equally importantin the area of financial control, enabling the finance manager to makeconstant reviews of the actual financial operations of the firm to analysethe causes of major deviations, which may help in corrective actionwherever indicated.\n(b) Top management: The importance of financial analysis is not limited to\nthe finance manager alone.

If this is not the case,\nthe deviation in the use of accounting principles should be mentioned as\na footnote. Comparative figures indicate the trend and direction of financial\nposition and operating results. This analysis is also known as ‘horizontal\nanalysis’.\n2. Common Size Statements: These are the statements which indicate the\nrelationship of different items of a financial statement with a common item\nby expressing each item as a percentage of that common item. The\npercentage thus calculated can be easily compared with the results of\ncorresponding percentages of the previous year or of some other firms, as\nthe numbers are brought to common base. Such statements also allow an\nanalyst to compare the operating and financing characteristics of two\ncompanies of different sizes in the same industry. Thus, common size\nstatements are useful, both, in intra-firm comparisons over different years\nand also in making inter-firm comparisons for the same year or for several\nyears. This analysis is also known as ‘Vertical analysis’.\n2024-25"

Using the previous years’ data of a\nbusiness enterprise, trend analysis can be done to observe the percentage\nchanges over time in the selected data. The trend percentage is the\npercentage relationship, in which each item of different years bear to the\nsame item in the base year. Trend analysis is important because, with its\nlong run view, it may point to basic changes in the nature of the business.\nBy looking at a trend in a particular ratio, one may find whether the ratio\nis falling, rising or remaining relatively constant. From this observation, a\nproblem is detected or the sign of good or poor management is detected.\n4. Ratio Analysis: It describes the significant relationship which exists\nbetween various items of a balance sheet and a statement of profit and\nloss of a firm. As a technique of financial analysis, accounting ratios measure\nthe comparative significance of the individual items of the income and\nposition statements. It is possible to assess the profitability, solvency and\nefficiency of an enterprise through the technique of ratio analysis.\n5. Cash Flow Analysis: It refers to the analysis of actual movement of cash\ninto and out of an organisation. The flow of cash into the business is called\nas cash inflow or positive cash flow and the flow of cash out of the firm iscalled as cash outflow or a negative cash flow. The difference between the\ninflow and outflow of cash is the net cash flow. Cash flow statement is\nprepared to project the manner in which the cash has been received and\nhas been utilised during an accounting year as it shows the sources of\ncash receipts and also the purposes for which payments are made. Thus,\nit summarises the causes for the changes in cash position of a business\nenterprise between dates of two balance sheets.\nIn this chapter, we shall have a brief idea about the first three techniques,\nviz., comparative statements, common size statements and trend analysis. The\nratio analysis and cash flow analysis is covered in detail in Chapters 5 and 6\nrespectively.\nTest your Understanding – I\nFill in the blanks with appropriate word(s):\n1.

As a result, it is possible to find out\nnot only the balances of accounts as on different dates and summaries of\ndifferent operational activities of different periods, but also the extent of their\nincrease or decrease between these dates. The figures in the comparative\nstatements can be used for identifying the direction of changes and also the\ntrends in different indicators of performance of an organisation.\nThe following steps may be followed to prepare the comparative statements:\nStep 1 : List out absolute figures in rupees relating to two points of time (as\nshown in columns 2 and 3 of Exhibit 4.1).Step 2 : Find out change in absolute figures by subtracting the first year\n(Col.2) from the second year (Col.3) and indicate the change as increase (+) ordecrease (–) and put it in column 4.\nStep 3 : Preferably, also calculate the percentage change as follows and put it\nin column 5.\n             Absolute Increase or Decrease (Col.4)\n           \n ____________________________________________________________    ×  100\n               First year absolute figure (Col.2)\nParticulars First Year Second Year Absolute Percentage\nIncrease (+) or Increase (+)\nDecrease (–) or Decrease (–)\n      1 2 3 4 5\nRs.

Here, each item in the statement is stated\nas a percentage of the aggregate, or revenue from operations of which that\nitem is a part. For example, a common size balance sheet shows the percentage\nof each asset to the total assets, and that of each liability to the total liabilities.\nSimilarly, in the common size  statement of profit and loss, the items of\nexpenditure are shown as a percentage of the revenue from operations. If\nsuch a statement is prepared for successive periods, it shows the changes of\nthe respective percentages over a period of time.\nCommon size analysis is of immense use for comparing enterprises which\ndiffer substantially in size as it provides an insight into the structure of financialstatements.  Inter-firm comparison or comparison of the company’s position\nwith the related industry as a whole is possible with the help of common size\nstatement analysis.\nThe following procedure may be adopted for preparing the common size\nstatements.\n1. List out absolute figures in rupees at two points of time, say year 1,\nand year 2 (Column 2 & 4 of Exhibit 4.2).\n2. Choose a common base (as 100). For example, revenue from operations\nmay be taken as base (100) in case of statement of profit and loss  and\ntotal assets or total liabilities (100) in case of balance sheet.\n3. For all items of Col. 2 and 3 work out the percentage of that total.\nColumn 4 and 5 shows these percentages in Exhibit 4.2.\nCommon Size Statement\nParticulars Year Y ear Percentage Percentage\none two of year 1 of year 2\n      1 2 3 4 5\nExhibit 4.2\n2024-25"

As such, the financial analysis also suffers from various limitations\nof financial statements. Hence, the analyst must be conscious of the impact of\nprice level changes, window dressing of financial statements, changes in\naccounting policies of a firm, accounting concepts and conventions, personal\njudgement, etc. Some other limitations of financial analysis are:\n1. Financial analysis does not consider price level changes.\n2. Financial analysis may be misleading without the knowledge of the\nchanges in accounting procedure followed by a firm.\n3. Financial analysis is just a study of reports of the company.\n4. Monetary information alone is considered in financial analysis while\nnon-monetary aspects are ignored.\n5. The financial statements are prepared on the basis of accounting\nconcept, as such, it does not reflect the current position.\n2024-25"

This act is termed as\nfinancial statement analysis. It is regarded as  anintegral and important part of accounting.

This\nchapter covers the technique of accounting ratios\nfor analysing the information contained in financial\nstatements for assessing the solvency, efficiency and\nprofitability of the enterprises.\n5.1 Meaning of Accounting Ratios\nAs stated earlier, accounting ratios are an important\ntool of financial statements analysis.

For example, if the\ngross profit of the business is Rs. 10,000 and the ‘Revenue from Operations’ are\nRs. 1,00,000, it can be said that the gross profit is 10% 10, 000100\n1, 00, 000×  of the\n‘Revenue from Operations’. This ratio is termed as gross profit ratio. Similarly,\ninventory turnover ratio may be 6 which implies that inventory turns into\n‘Revenue from Operations’ six times in a year.\nIt needs to be observed that accounting ratios exhibit relationship, if any,\nbetween accounting numbers extracted from financial statements. Ratios are\nessentially derived numbers and their efficacy depends a great deal upon the\nbasic numbers from which they are calculated. Hence, if the financial statements\ncontain some errors, the derived numbers in terms of ratio analysis would also\npresent an erroneous scenario. Further, a ratio must be calculated using\nnumbers which are meaningfully correlated. A ratio calculated by using two\nunrelated numbers would hardly serve any purpose. For example, the furniture\nof the business is Rs. 1,00,000 and Purchases are Rs. 3,00,000. The ratio of\npurchases to furniture is 3 (3,00,000/1,00,000) but it hardly has any relevance.\nThe reason is that there is no relationship between these two aspects.\n5.2 Objectives of Ratio Analysis\nRatio analysis is indispensable part of interpretation of results revealed by the\nfinancial statements. It provides users with crucial financial information and\npoints out the areas which require investigation. Ratio analysis is a technique\nwhich involves regrouping of data by application of arithmetical relationships,\nthough its interpretation is a complex matter. It requires a fine understanding\nof the way and the rules used for preparing financial statements. Once done\neffectively, it provides a lot of information which helps the analyst:\n1. To know the areas of the business which need more attention;2. To know about the potential areas which can be improved with the\neffort in the desired direction;\n3. To provide a deeper analysis of the profitability, liquidity, solvency\nand efficiency levels in the business;\n4. To provide information for making cross-sectional analysis by\ncomparing the performance with the best industry standards; and\n5. To provide information derived from financial statements useful for\nmaking projections and estimates for the future.\n5.3 Advantages of Ratio Analysis\nThe ratio analysis if properly done improves the user’s understanding of the\nefficiency with which the business is being conducted.

If properly\nanalysed, the ratios make us understand various problem areas as well as the\nbright spots of the business. The knowledge of problem areas help management\ntake care of them in future. The knowledge of areas which are working better\nhelps you improve the situation further. It must be emphasised that ratios are\nmeans to an end rather than the end in themselves. Their role is essentially\nindicative and that of a whistle blower. There are many advantages derived\nfrom ratio analysis. These are summarised as follows:\n1.Helps to understand efficacy of decisions:  The ratio analysis helps\nyou to understand whether the business firm has taken the right kind\nof operating, investing and financing decisions. It indicates how far\nthey have helped in improving the performance.\n2.Simplify complex figures and establish relationships:  Ratios help in\nsimplifying the complex accounting figures and bring out their\nrelationships. They help summarise the financial information effectively\nand assess the managerial efficiency, firm’s credit worthiness, earning\ncapacity, etc.\n3.Helpful in comparative analysis:  The ratios are not be calculated for\none year only. When many year figures are kept side by side, they help\na great deal in exploring the trends visible in the business. The\nknowledge of trend helps in making projections about the businesswhich is a very useful feature.\n4.Identification of problem areas:  Ratios help business in identifying\nthe problem areas as well as the bright areas of the business. Problem\nareas would need more attention and bright areas will need polishing\nto have still better results.\n5.Enables SWOT analysis:  Ratios help a great deal in explaining the\nchanges occurring in the business. The information of change helps\nthe management a great deal in understanding the current threats\nand opportunities and allows business to do its own SWOT (Strength-\nWeakness-Opportunity-Threat) analysis.\n6.Various comparisons:  Ratios help comparisons with certain bench\nmarks to assess as to whether firm’s performance is better or otherwise.\nFor this purpose, the profitability, liquidity, solvency, etc., of a business,\nmay be compared: (i)  over a number of accounting periods with itself\n(Intra-firm Comparison/Time Series Analysis), (ii) with other businessenterprises (Inter-firm Comparison/Cross-sectional Analysis) and\n(iii) with standards set for that firm/industry (comparison with standard\n(or industry expectations).\n2024-25"

Thus, the limitations of financial statements also form the\nlimitations of the ratio analysis. Hence, to interpret the ratios, the user should\nbe aware of the rules followed in the preparation of financial statements and\nalso their nature and limitations. The limitations of ratio analysis which arise\nprimarily from the nature of financial statements are as under:\n1.Limitations of Accounting Data: Accounting data give an unwarrantedimpression of precision and finality. In fact, accounting data “reflect a\ncombination of recorded facts, accounting conventions and personal\njudgements which affect them materially. For example, profit of the\nbusiness is not a precise and final figure. It is merely an opinion of the\naccountant based on application of accounting policies. The soundness\nof the judgement necessarily depends on the competence and integrity\nof those who make them and on their adherence to Generally Accepted\nAccounting Principles and Conventions”. Thus, the financial statements\nmay not reveal the true state of affairs of the enterprises and so the\nratios will also not give the true picture.\n2.Ignores Price-level Changes:  The financial accounting is based on\nstable money measurement principle. It implicitly assumes that price\nlevel changes are either non-existent or minimal. But the truth is\notherwise. We are normally living in inflationary economies where the\npower of money declines constantly. A change in the price-level makes\nanalysis of financial statement of different accounting years meaningless\nbecause accounting records ignore changes in value of money.\n3.Ignore Qualitative or Non-monetary Aspects:  Accounting provides\ninformation about quantitative (or monetary) aspects of business.\nHence, the ratios also reflect only the monetary aspects, ignoring\ncompletely the non-monetary (qualitative) factors.\n4.Variations in Accounting Practices:  There are differing accounting\npolicies for valuation of inventory, calculation of depreciation, treatment\nof intangibles Assets definition of certain financial variables etc.,\navailable for various aspects of business transactions. These variations\nleave a big question mark on the cross-sectional analysis. As there are\nvariations in accounting practices followed by different business\nenterprises, a valid comparison of their financial statements is not\npossible.\n5.Forecasting:  Forecasting of future trends based only on historical\nanalysis is not feasible. Proper forecasting requires consideration of\nnon-financial factors as well.\n2024-25"

                "text": "198 Accountancy : Company Accounts and Analysis of Financial Statements\nNow let us talk about the limitations of the ratios. The various limitations are:\n1.Means and not the End:  Ratios are means to an end rather than the\nend by itself.\n2.Lack of ability to resolve problems:  Their role is essentially indicative\nand of whistle blowing and not providing a solution to the problem.\n3.Lack of standardised definitions:  There is a lack of standardised\ndefinitions of various concepts used in ratio analysis. For example,\nthere is no standard definition of liquid liabilities. Normally, it includes\nall current liabilities, but sometimes it refers to current liabilities less\nbank overdraft.\n4.Lack of universally accepted standard levels:  There is no universal\nyardstick which specifies the level of ideal ratios. There is no standard\nlist of the levels universally acceptable, and, in India, the industry\naverages are also not available.\n5.Ratios based on unrelated figures:  A ratio calculated for unrelated\nfigures would essentially be a meaningless exercise. For example,\ncreditors of Rs. 1,00,000 and furniture of Rs. 1,00,000 represent a\nratio of 1:1. But it has no relevance to assess efficiency or solvency.\nHence, ratios should be used with due consciousness of their limitations\nwhile evaluating the performance of an organisation and planning the future\nstrategies for its improvement.\nTest your Understanding – I\n1. State which of the following statements are True or False.\n(a) The only purpose of financial reporting is to keep the managers informed\nabout the progress of operations.\n(b) Analysis of data provided in the financial statements is termed as financial\nanalysis.\n(c) Long-term borrowings are concerned about the ability of a firm to discharge\nits obligations to pay interest and repay the principal amount.\n(d) A ratio is always expressed as a quotient of one number divided by another.\n(e) Ratios help in comparisons of a firm’s results over a number of accounting\nperiods as well as with other business enterprises.\n(f) A ratio reflects quantitative and qualitative aspects of results.\n5.5 Types of Ratios\nThere is a two way classification of ratios: (1) traditional classification, and\n(2) functional classification. The traditional classification has been on the\nbasis of financial statements to which the determinants of ratios belong. On\nthis basis the ratios are classified as follows:\n2024-25"

For example, ratio of gross profit to revenue from operations is\nknown as gross profit ratio. It is calculated using both figures from\nthe statement of profit and loss.\n2.Balance Sheet Ratios:  In case both variables are from the balance\nsheet, it is classified as balance sheet ratios. For example, ratio of\ncurrent assets to current liabilities known as current ratio. It is\ncalculated using both figures from balance sheet.\n3.Composite Ratios:  If a ratio is computed with one variable from the\nstatement of profit and loss and another variable from the balance\nsheet, it is called composite ratio. For example, ratio of credit revenue\nfrom operations to trade receivables (known as trade receivables\nturnover ratio) is calculated using one figure from the statement of\nprofit and loss (credit revenue from operations) and another figure\n(trade receivables) from the balance sheet.\nAlthough accounting ratios are calculated by taking data from financial\nstatements but classification of ratios on the basis of financial statements is\nrarely used in practice. It must be recalled that basic purpose of accounting is\nto throw light on the financial performance (profitability) and financial position\n(its capacity to raise money and invest them wisely) as well as changes occurringin financial position (possible explanation of changes in the activity level). As\nsuch, the alternative classification (functional classification) based on the\npurpose for which a ratio is computed, is the most commonly used classification\nwhich is as follows:\n1. Liquidity Ratios:  To meet its commitments, business needs liquid\nfunds. The ability of the business to pay the amount due to\nstakeholders as and when it is due is known as liquidity, and the\nratios calculated to measure it are known as ‘Liquidity Ratios’. These\nare essentially short-term in nature.\n2. Solvency Ratios:  Solvency of business is determined by its ability to\nmeet its contractual obligations towards stakeholders, particularly\ntowards external stakeholders, and the ratios calculated to measure\nsolvency position are known as ‘Solvency Ratios’. These are essentially\nlong-term in nature.\n3. Activity (or Turnover) Ratios:   This refers to the ratios that are\ncalculated for measuring the efficiency of operations of business based\non effective utilisation of resources.

These are\nanalysed by looking at the amounts of current assets and current liabilities in\nthe balance sheet. The two ratios included in this category are current ratio\nand liquidity ratio.\n5.6.1  Current Ratio\nCurrent ratio is the proportion of current assets to current liabilities. It is\nexpressed as follows:\n   Current Ratio  =  Current Assets : Current Liabilities or Current Assets\nCurrent Liabilities\nCurrent assets include current investments, inventories, trade receivables\n(debtors and bills receivables), cash and cash equivalents, short-term loans and\nadvances and other current assets such as prepaid expenses, advance tax and\naccrued income, etc.\nCurrent liabilities include short-term borrowings, trade payables (creditors\nand bills payables), other current liabilities and short-term provisions.\nIllustration 1\nCalulate Current Ratio from the following information:\nParticulars (Rs.)\nInventories 50 ,000\nTrade receivables 50 ,000\nAdvance tax 4,000\nCash and cash equivalents 30 ,000\nTrade payables 1,00,000\nShort-term borrowings (bank overdraft) 4,000\nSolution:\nCurrent Ratio =Current Assets\nCurrent Liabilities\nCurrent Assets = Inventories + Trade receivables + Advance tax +\nCash and cash equivalents\n= Rs. 50,000 + Rs. 50,000 + Rs. 4,000 + Rs. 30,000= Rs. 1,34,000\nCurrent Liabilities = Trade payables + Short-term borrowings\n= Rs. 1,00,000 + Rs. 4,000= Rs. 1,04,000\nCurrent Ratio =\nRs.1,34,000\n=1 . 2 9:1\nRs.1,04,000\n2024-25"

The excess of current assets over current liabilities provides a measure\nof safety margin available against uncertainty in realisation of current assets\nand flow of funds. The ratio should be reasonable. It should neither be very high\nor very low. Both the situations have their inherent disadvantages. A very high\ncurrent ratio implies heavy investment in current assets which is not a good\nsign as it reflects under utilisation or improper utilisation of resources. A low\nratio endangers the business and puts it at risk of facing a situation where it\nwill not be able to pay its short-term debt on time. If this problem persists, it\nmay affect firm’s credit worthiness adversely. Normally, it is safe to have this\nratio within the range of 2:1.\n5.6.2 Quick or Liquid Ratio\nIt is the ratio of quick (or liquid) asset to current liabilities. It is expressed as\nQuick ratio = Quick Assets : Current Liabilities  or  Quick Assets\nCurrent Liabilities\nThe quick assets are defined as those assets which are quickly convertible\ninto cash. While calculating quick assets we exclude the inventories at the end\nand other current assets such as prepaid expenses, advance tax, etc., from the\ncurrent assets. Because of exclusion of non-liquid current assets it is considered\nbetter than current ratio as a measure of liquidity position of the business. It is\ncalculated to serve as a supplementary check on liquidity position of the business\nand is therefore, also known as ‘Acid-Test Ratio’.\nIllustration 2\nCalculate quick ratio from the information given in illustration 1.\nSolution:\nQuick Ratio =Quick Assets\nCurrent Liabilities\nQuick Assets = Current assets – (Inventories + Advance tax)\n= Rs. 1,34,000 – (Rs. 50,000 + Rs. 4,000)\n= Rs. 80,000\nCurrent Liabilities = Rs. 1,04,000\nQuick Ratio =Rs. 80,000\n=0 . 7 7:1\nRs. 1,04,000\nSignificance: The ratio provides a measure of the capacity of the business to\nmeet its short-term obligations without any flaw.

If debt component of the total long-term funds employed is small,\noutsiders feel more secure. From security point of view, capital structure\nwith less debt and more equity is considered favourable as it reduces the\nchances of bankruptcy.  Normally, it is considered to be safe if debt equity\nratio is 2 : 1. However, it may vary from industry to industry. It is computed\nas follows:\nDebt-Equity Ratio =− Longterm Debts\nShareholders’ Funds \nwhere:\nShareholders’ Funds (Equity) = Share capital + Reserves and Surplus +\nMoney received against share warrants +Share application money pending allotment\nShare Capital = Equity share capital + Preference share capital\nor\nShareholders’ Funds (Equity) = Non-current sssets + Working capital \n–\nNon-current liabilities\nWorking Capital = Current Assets – Current Liabilities\nSignificance:  This ratio measures the degree of indebtedness of an enterprise\nand gives an idea to the long-term lender regarding extent of security of the\ndebt. As indicated earlier, a low debt equity ratio reflects more security. A high\nratio, on the other hand, is considered risky as it may put the firm into\ndifficulty in meeting its obligations to outsiders. However, from the perspective\nof the owners, greater use of debt (trading on equity) may help in ensuring\nhigher returns for them if the rate of earnings on capital employed is higher\nthan the rate of interest payable.\n2024-25"

It is\ncomputed as follows:\nDebt to Capital Employed Ratio = Long-term Debt/Capital Employed (or Net Assets)\nCapital employed is equal to the long-term debt + shareholders’ funds.\nAlternatively, it may be taken as net assets which are equal to the total assets– current liabilities taking the data of Illustration 7, capital employed shall\nwork out to Rs. 5,00,000 + Rs. 15,00,000 = Rs. 20,00,000. Similarly, Net\nAssets as Rs. 25,00,000 – \nRs. 5,00,000 = Rs. 20,00,000 and the Debt to\ncapital employed ratio as Rs. 5,00,000/ Rs. 20,00,000 = 0.25:1.\nSignificance: Like debt-equity ratio, it shows proportion of long-term debts in\ncapital employed.

The activity ratios express the number of times assets employed,or, for that matter, any constituent of assets, is turned into sales during anaccounting period. Higher turnover ratio means better utilisation of assets\nand signifies improved efficiency and profitability, and as such are known as\nefficiency ratios. The important activity ratios calculated under this categoryare\n1. Inventory Turnover;\n2. Trade receivable Turnover;\n3. Trade payable Turnover;4. Investment (Net assets) Turnover5. Fixed assets Turnover; and\n6. Working capital Turnover.\n5.8.1 Inventory Turnover Ratio\nIt determines the number of times inventory is converted into revenue from\noperations during the accounting period under consideration. It expresses\nthe relationship between the cost of revenue from operations and averageinventory. The formula for its calculation is as follows:\nInventory Turnover Ratio  =  Cost of Revenue from Operations / Average Inventory\nWhere average inventory refers to arithmetic average of opening and\nclosing inventory, and the cost of revenue from operations means revenuefrom operations less gross profit.\nSignificance :  It studies the frequency of conversion of inventory of finished\ngoods into revenue from operations. It is also a measure of liquidity. It\ndetermines how many times inventory is purchased or replaced during ayear. Low turnover of inventory may be due to bad buying, obsoleteinventory, etc., and is a danger signal. High turnover is good but it must\nbe carefully interpreted as it may be due to buying in small lots or selling\nquickly at low margin to realise cash. Thus, it throws light on utilisation ofinventory of goods.\n2024-25"

Accounting ratios represent relationship between two accounting\nnumbers.\nObjective of Ratio Analysis:  The objective of ratio analysis is to provide a\ndeeper analysis of the profitability, liquidity, solvency and activity levels inthe business. It is also to identify the problem areas as well as the strong\nareas of the business.\nAdvantages of Ratio Analysis: Ratio analysis offers many advantages\nincluding enabling financial statement analysis, helping understand efficacyof decisions, simplifying complex figures and establish relationships, being\nhelpful in comparative analysis, identification of problem areas, enables\nSWOT analysis, and allows various comparisons.\nLimitations of Ratio Analysis:  There are many limitations of ratio analysis.\nFew are based because of the basic limitations of the accounting data onwhich it is based. In the first set are included factors like Historical Analysis,\nIgnores Price-level Changes, Ignore Qualitative or Non-monetary Aspects,\nLimitations of Accounting Data, Variations in Accounting Practices, and\nForecasting. In the second set are included factor like means and not the\nend, lack of ability to resolve problems, lack of standardised definitions,\nlack of universally accepted standard levels, and ratios based on unrelated\nfigures.\nTypes of Ratios : There are many types of ratios, viz., liquidity, solvency,\nactivity and profitability ratios. The liquidity ratios include current ratioand acid test ratio.  Solvency ratios are calculated to determine the ability\nof the business to service its debt in the long run instead of in the short\nrun. They include debt equity ratio, total assets to debt ratio, proprietary\n2024-25"

It requires that an enterprise should prepare a cash\nflow statement and should present it for each accounting period for which\nfinancial statements are presented. This chapter discusses this technique and\nexplains the method of preparing a cash flow statement for an accounting\nperiod.\n6.1 Objectives of Cash Flow Statement\nA Cash flow statement shows inflow and outflow of cash and cash equivalents\nfrom various activities of a company during a specific period. The primary objective\nof cash flow statement is to provide useful information about cash flows (inflows\nand outflows) of an enterprise during a particular period under various heads,\ni.e., operating activities, investing activities and financing activities.\nThis information is useful in providing users of financial statements with a\nbasis to assess the ability of the enterprise to generate cash and cash equivalents\nand the needs of the enterprise to utilise those cash flows. The economic decisions\nthat are taken by users require an evaluation of the ability of an enterprise to\ngenerate cash and cash equivalents and the timing and certainty of their\ngeneration.\n6.2 Benefits of Cash Flow Statement\nCash flow statement provides the following benefits :\nA cash flow statement when used along with other financial statements\nprovides information that enables users to evaluate changes in net assets\nof an enterprise, its financial structure (including its liquidity and\nsolvency) and its ability to affect the amounts and timings of cash flows\nin order to adapt to changing circumstances and opportunities.\nCash flow information is useful in assessing the ability of the enterpriseto generate cash and cash equivalents and enables users to develop\nmodels to assess and compare the present value of the future cash\nflows of different enterprises.\nIt also enhances the comparability of the reporting of operatingperformance by different enterprises because it eliminates the effects of\nusing different accounting treatments for the same transactions and\nevents.\nIt also helps in balancing its cash inflow and cash outflow, keeping inresponse to changing condition. It is also helpful in checking the\naccuracy of past assessments of future cash flows and in examining\nthe relationship between profitability and net cash flow and impact of\nchanging prices.\n2024-25"

As per AS-3, ‘Cash’ comprises cash in hand and demand deposits with\nbanks, and  ‘Cash equivalents’ means short-term highly liquid investments that\nare readily convertible into known amounts of cash and which are subj ect to\nan insignificant risk of changes in value. An investment normally qualifies ascash equivalents only when it has a short maturity, of say, three months or less\nfrom the date of acquisition. Investments in shares are excluded from cash\nequivalents unless they are in substantial cash equivalents. For example,\npreference shares of a company acquired shortly before their specific redemption\ndate, provided there is only insignificant risk of failure of the company to repay\nthe amount at maturity. Similarly, short-term marketable securities which can\nbe readily converted into cash are treated as cash equivalents and is liquidable\nimmediately without considerable change in value.\n6.4 Cash Flows\n‘Cash Flows’  implies movement of cash in and out due to some non-cash items.\nReceipt of cash from a non-cash item is termed as cash inflow while cash payment\nin respect of such items as cash outflow. For example, purchase of machineryby paying cash  is cash outflow while sale proceeds received from sale of\nmachinery is cash inflow. Other examples of cash flows include collection of\ncash from trade receivables , payment to trade payables, payment to employees,\nreceipt of dividend, interest  payments, etc.\nCash  management includes the investment of excess cash in cash equivalents.\nHence, purchase of marketable securities or short-term investment whichconstitutes cash equivalents is not considered while preparing cash flow\nstatement.\n6.5 Classification of Activities for the Preparation of Cash Flow\nStatement\nYou know that various activities of an enterprise result into cash flows (inflows\nor receipts and outflows or payments) which is the subject matter of a cash flow\nstatement. As per AS-3, these activities are to be classified into three categories:\n(1) operating, (2) investing, and (3) financing activities so as to show separately\nthe cash flows generated (or used) by (in) these activities. This helps the users of\ncash flow statement to assess the impact of these activities on the financial\nposition of an enterprise and also on its cash and cash equivalents.\n2024-25"

For example, for a company manufacturing garments, operating\nactivities are procurement of raw material, incurrence of manufacturing expenses,\nsale of garments, etc. These are the principal  revenue generating activities (or\nthe main activities) of the enterprise and these activities are not investing or\nfinancing activities. The amount of cash from operations’ indicates the internal\nsolvency level of the company, and is regarded as the key indicator of the extent\nto which the operations of the enterprise have generated sufficient cash flows to\nmaintain the operating capability of the enterprise, paying dividends, making of\nnew investments and repaying of loans without recourse to external source of\nfinancing.\nCash flows from operating activities are primarily derived from the main\nactivities of the enterprise. They generally result from the transactions and other\nevents that enter into the determination of net profit or loss. Examples of cash\nflows from operating activities are:\nCash Inflows from operating activities\ncash receipts from sale of  goods and the rendering of services.\ncash receipts from royalties, fees, commissions and other revenues.\nCash Outflows from operating activities\nCash payments to suppliers for goods and services.\nCash payments to and on behalf of the employees.\nCash payments to an insurance enterprise for premiums and claims,\nannuities, and other policy benefits.\nCash payments of income taxes unless they can be specifically identifiedwith financing and investing activities.\nThe net position is shown in case of operating cash flows.\nAn enterprise may hold securities and loans for dealing or for trading\npurposes. In either case they represent Inventory specifically held for resale.\nTherefore, cash flows arising from the purchase and sale of dealing or trading\nsecurities are classified as operating activities. Similarly, cash advances and\nloans made by financial enterprises are usually classified as operating activities\nsince they relate to main activity of that enterprise.\n6.5.2 Cash from Investing Activities\nAs per AS-3, investing activities are the acquisition and   disposal of long-term\nassets and other investments not included in cash  equivalents. Investing\nactivities relate to purchase and sale of long-term assets or fixed assets such\n2024-25"

Examples of cash\nflows arising from investing activities are:\nCash Outflows from investing activities\nCash payments to acquire fixed assets including intangibles and\ncapitalised research and development.\nCash payments to acquire shares, warrants or debt instruments of otherenterprises other than the instruments those held for trading purposes.\nCash advances and loans made to third party (other than advancesand loans made by a financial enterprise wherein it is operating\nactivities).\nCash Inflows from Investing Activities\nCash receipt from disposal of  fixed assets including intangibles.\nCash receipt from the repayment of advances or loans made to thirdparties (except in case of financial enterprise).\nCash receipt from disposal of shares, warrants or debt instruments of\nother enterprises except those held for trading purposes.\nInterest received in cash from loans and advances.\nDividend received from investments in other enterprises.\n6.5.3 Cash from Financing Activities\nAs the name suggests, financing activities relate to long-term funds or capital of\nan enterprise, e.g., cash proceeds from issue of equity shares, debentures, raising\nlong-term bank loans, repayment of bank loan, etc. As per AS-3, financing\nactivities are activities that result in changes in the size and composition of the\nowners’ capital   (including preference share capital in case of a company) and\nborrowings of the enterprise. Separate disclosure of cash flows arising from\nfinancing activities is important because it is useful in predicting claims on future\ncash flows by providers of funds ( both capital and borrowings ) to the enterprise.\nExamples of financing activities are:\nCash Inflows from financing activities\nCash proceeds from issuing shares (equity or/and preference).\nCash proceeds from issuing debentures, loans, bonds and other\nshort/ long-term borrowings.\n2024-25"

Extraordinary items are non-recurring in nature and\nhence cash flows associated with extraordinary items should be classified and\ndisclosed separately as arising from operating, investing or financing activities.\nThis is done to enable users to understand their nature and effect on the\npresent and future cash flows of an enterprise.\nInterest and Dividend\nIn case of a financial enterprise (whose main business is lending and borrowing),\ninterest paid,  interest received  and dividend received are classified as operating\nactivities while  dividend  paid is a financing activity.\nIn case of a non-financial enterprise, as per AS-3, it is considered more\nappropriate that  payment of interest and dividends are classified as financing\nactivities whereas receipt of interest and dividends are classified as investing\nactivities.\nTaxes on Income and Gains\nTaxes may be income tax (tax on normal profit), capital gains tax (tax on\ncapital profits), dividend tax (tax on the amount distributed as dividend to\nshareholders). AS-3 requires that cash flows arising from taxes on income\nshould be separately disclosed and should be classified as cash flows from\noperating activities unless they can be specifically identified with financing\nand investing activities. This clearly implies that:\ntax on operating profit should be classified as operating cash flows.\ndividend tax, i.e., tax paid on dividend should be classified as financing\nactivity along with dividend paid.\nCapital gains tax paid on sale of fixed assets should be classified underinvesting activities.\nNon-cash Transactions\nAs per AS-3, investing and financing transactions that do not require the use\nof cash or cash equivalents should be excluded from a cash flow statement.\nExamples of such transactions are – acquisition of machinery by issue of equity\nshares or redemption of debentures by issue of equity shares. Such transactions\nshould be disclosed elsewhere in the financial statements in a way that provide\nall the relevant information about these investing and financing activities.\nHence, assets acquired by issue of shares are not disclosed in cash flow\nstatement due to non-cash nature of the transaction.\n2024-25"

Then this amount\nis for non-cash items, etc., adjusted for ascertaining cash flows from\noperating activities.\nAccordingly, cash flow from operating activities can be determined using\neither the Direct method or the Indirect method.The direct method provides\ninformation which is useful in estimating future cash flows. But such\ninformation is not available under the indirect method. However, in practice,\nindirect method is mostly used by the companies for arriving at the net cash\nflow from operating activities. The Chapter deals with preparing cash flowstatement using indirect method.\nProposed Dividend\nAs per AS-4, Contingencies and Events Occurring after the Balance\nSheet Date , Proposed dividend is shown in the Notes to Accounts. It\nwill be shown as contingent liability since it becomes a liability after\nit is declared (approved) by the shareholders.

This is so because statement of profit and loss\nincorporates the effects of all operating activities of an enterprise. However,\nStatement of Profit and Loss is prepared on accrual basis (and not on cash\nbasis). Moreover, it also includes certain non-operating items such as interest\npaid, profit/loss on sale of fixed assets, etc.) and non-cash items (such as\ndepreciation, goodwill written-off, divident declared, etc. Therefore, it becomes\nnecessary to adjust the amount of net profit/loss as shown by Statement of\nProfit and Loss for arriving at cash flows from operating activities. Let us look\nat the example :\nStatement of Profit and Loss Account\nfor the year ended March 31, 2017\nParticulars Note Figures in\n(Rs.)\ni) Revenue from Operations 1,00,000\nii) Other Income 1 2,000\niii) T otal Revenues (i+ii) 1,02,000\niv) Expenses\nCost of Materials Consumed  30,000\nPurchases of stock-in-trade 10,000\nEmployees Benefits Expenses 10,000\nFinance Costs 5,000\nDepreciation 5,000\nOther Expenses 12,000\n72,000\nv) Profit before Tax (iii-iv) 30,000\nNote: Other income includes profit on sale of land.\nThe above Statement of Profit and Loss shows the amount of net profit of\nRs. 30,000. This has to be adjusted for arriving cash flows from operating\nactivities. Let us take various items one by one.\n1.Depreciation is a non-cash item and hence, Rs. 5,000 charged as\ndepreciation does not result in any cash flow. Therefore, this amount\nmust be added back to the net profit.\n2.Finance costs of Rs. 5,000 is a cash outflow on account of financing\nactivity. Therefore, this amount must also be added back to net\nprofit while calculating cash flows from operating activities. This\namount of finance cost will be shown as an outflow under the head\nof financing activities.\n2024-25"

Hence, this amount must be deducted from the\namount of net profit while calculating cash flows from operating\nactivities.\nThe above example gives you an idea as to how various adjustments are\nmade in the amount of net profit/loss. Other important adjustments relate to\nchanges in working capital which are necessary (i.e., items of current assets\nand current liabilities) to convert net profit/loss which is based on accrual\nbasis into cash flows from operating activities. Therefore, the increase in\ncurrent assets and decrease in current liabilities are deducted from the operating\nprofit, and the decrease in current assets and increase in current liabilities\nare added to the  operating profit so as to arrive at the exact amount of net\ncash flow from operating activities.\nAs per AS-3, under indirect method, net cash flow from operating activities is\ndetermined by adjusting net profit or loss for the effect of :\nNon-cash items such as depreciation, goodwill written-off, provisions,deferred taxes, etc., which are to be added back.\nAll other items for which the cash effects are investing or financing cashflows. The treatment of such items depends upon their nature. All investing\nand financing incomes are to be deducted from the amount of net profits\nwhile all such expenses are to be added back. For example, finance costwhich is a financing cash outflow is to be added back while other income\nsuch as interest received which is investing cash inflow is to be deducted\nfrom the amount of net profit. Dividend declared is a financial activity\nand is therefore added back to net profit and shown as out flow under\nfinancial activity.\nChanges in current assets and liabilities during the period. Increase incurrent assets and decrease in current liabilities are to be deducted while\nincrease in current liabilities and decrease in current assets are to be\nadded up.\nExhibit 6.4 shows the proforma of calculating cash flows from operating\nactivities as per indirect method.\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\n(Indirect Method)\nNet Profit/Loss before Tax and Extraordinary Items\n+ Deductions already made in Statement of Profit and Loss on account of xxx\nNon-cash items such as Depreciation, Goodwill to be Written-off.\n+ Deductions already made in Statement of Profit and Loss on Account of xxx\nNon-operating items such as Interest.\n– Additions (incomes) made in Statement of Profit and Loss on xxx\nAccount of Non-operating items such as Dividend received, xxx\nProfit on sale of Fixed Assets.\n2024-25"

The activities contributing to this change are classified into operating,investing and financing. The methology of working out the net cash flow (oruse) from all the three activities for an accounting period has been explainedin details and a brief format of Cash Flow Statement has also been given inExhibit 6.2. However, while preparing a cash flow statement, full details ofinflows and outflows are given under these heads including the net cash flow(or use). The aggregate of the net ‘cash flows (or use) is worked out and isshown as ‘Net Increase/Decrease in cash and Cash Equivalents’ to which theamount of ‘cash and cash equivalent at the beginning’ is added and thus the\namount of ‘cash and cash equivalents at the end’ is arrived at as shown in\nExhibit 6.2. This figure will be the same as the total amount of cash in hand,cash at bank and cash equivalants (if any) given in the balance sheet (seeIllustrations 7 to 10). Another point that needs to be noted is that when cashflows from operating activities are worked out by an indirect method andshown as such in the cash flow statement, the statement itself is termed as‘Indirect method cash flow statement’. Thus, the Cash flow statements preparedin Illustrations 7, 8 and 9 fall under this category as the cash flows fromoperating activities have been worked out by indirect method. Similarly, if thecash flows from operating activities are worked by direct method while preparingthe cash flow statement, it will be termed as ‘direct method Cash FlowStatement’. Illustration 10 shows both types of Cash Flow Statement. However,\nunless it is specified clearly as to which method is to be used, the cash flow\nstatement may preferably be prepared by an indirect method as is done bymost companies in practice.\nIllustration 7\nFrom the following information, prepare Cash Flow Statement for Pioneer Ltd.\nBalance Sheet of Pioneer Ltd., as on March 31, 2017\nParticulars Amount Amount\n(Rs.)
