Take, for example, the\npocket money that you get to spend. If\nyou had more of it then you could have\npurchased almost all the things you\nwanted. But since your pocket money\nis limited, you have to choose only\nthose things that you want the most.\nThis is a basic teaching of Economics.\nActivities\n•Can you think for yourself of\nsome other examples where a\nperson with a given income has\nto choose which things and in\nwhat quantities he or she can\nbuy at the prices that are being\ncharged (called the current\nprices)?\n•What will happen if the current\nprices go up?\nScarcity  is the root of all economic\nproblems. Had there been no scarcity,\nthere would have been no economic\nproblem. And you would not have\nstudied Economics either . In our daily\nlife, we face various forms of scarcity.\nThe long queues at railway booking\ncounters, crowded buses and trains,\nshortage of essential commodities, the\nrush to get a ticket to watch a new film,\netc., are all manifestations of scarcity.\nWe face scar city because the things that\nsatisfy our wants are limited in\navailability.

For this, you\nneed to know reliable facts about all\nthe diverse economic activities like\nproduction, consumption and\ndistribution. Economics is often\ndiscussed in three parts:  consumption,\nproduction and distribution .\nWe want to know how the consumer\ndecides, given his income and many\nalternative goods to choose from, what\nto buy when he knows the prices. This\nis the study of Consumption.\nWe also want to know how the\nproducer , similarly, chooses what and\nhow to produce for the market. This is\nthe study of Production.\nFinally, we want to know how the\nnational income or the total income\narising fr om what has been pr oduced\nin the country (called the Gr oss\nDomestic Pr oduct or GDP) is\ndistributed thr ough wages (and\nsalaries), pr ofits and inter est (W e will\nleave aside her e income fr om\ninternational trade and investment).\nThis is the study of Distribution.\nBesides these three conventional\ndivisions of the study of Economics\nabout which we want to know all the\nfacts, moder n economics has to\ninclude some of the basic pr oblems\nfacing the country for special studies.\nFor example, you might want to\nknow why or to what extent some\nhouseholds in our society have the\ncapacity to earn much more than\nothers.

STATISTICS  IN ECONOMICS\nIn the previous section you were told\nabout certain special studies that\nconcern the basic problems facing a\ncountry. These studies required that we\nknow more about economic facts. Such\neconomic facts are also known as\neconomic data .\nThe purpose of collecting data\nabout these economic problems is to\nunderstand and explain these\nproblems in terms of the various causes\nbehind them. In other words, we try to\nanalyse them. For example, when we\nanalyse  the hardships of poverty, we\ntry to explain it in terms of the various\nfactors such as unemployment, low\nproductivity of people, backward\ntechnology, etc.\nBut, what purpose does the\nanalysis of poverty serve unless we are\nable to find ways to mitigate it. W e may,\ntherefore, also try to find those\nmeasures that help solve an economic\nproblem.

And, that, in such a situation,\nno policies can be formulated to solve it.\nIf yes, then you have, to a large extent,\nunderstood the basic relationship\nbetween Economics and Statistics.\n3. WHAT IS STATISTICS ?\nAt this stage you are probably ready\nto know mor e about Statistics. Y ou\nmight very well want to know what the\nsubject ‘Statistics’ is all about.\nStatistics deals with the collection,\nanalysis, interpretation and presentation\nof numerical data. It is a branch of\nmathematics and also used in the\ndisciplines  such as accounting,\neconomics, management, physics,\nfinance, psychology and sociology.\nHere we are concerned with data\nfrom the field of Economics. Most\nEconomics data are quantitative. For\nexample, a statement in Economics like\n“the production of rice in India has\nincreased from 39.58 million tonnes in\n1974–75 to 106.5 million tonnes in\n2013–14, is a quantitative data.\nIn addition to quantitative data,\nEconomics also uses qualitative data.\nThe chief characteristic of such\ninformation is that they describe\nattributes of a single person or a group\nof persons that is important to record\nas accurately as possible even though\nthey cannot be measured in\nquantitative terms. Take, for example,\n‘gender’ that distinguishes a person as\nman/woman or boy/girl. It is often\npossible (and useful) to state the\ninformation about an attribute of a\nperson in terms of degrees (like better/worse; sick/ healthy/ more healthy;\nunskilled/ skilled/ highly skilled, etc.).\nSuch qualitative information or\nstatistics is often used in Economics\nand other social sciences and  collected\nand stored systematically like\nquantitative information (on prices,\nincomes, taxes paid, etc.), whether for\na single person or a group of persons.\nYou will study in the subsequent\nchapters that statistics  involves\ncollection  of data. The next step is to\npresent the data in  tabular ,\ndiagrammatic and  graphic forms. The\ndata, then, are summarised by\ncalculating various numerical indices,\nsuch as  mean, variance, standard\ndeviation,  etc., that represent the broad\ncharacteristics of the collected set of\ninformation. Finally, the data are\nanalysed and interpreted.\nActivities\n•Think of two examples of\nqualitative and quantitative\ndata.\n•Which of the following would\ngive you qualitative data;\nbeauty, intelligence, income\nearned, marks in a subject,\nability to sing, learning skills?\n4. WHAT STATISTICS  DOES?\nStatistics is an indispensable tool for\nan economist that helps him to\nunderstand an economic problem.\nUsing its various methods, effort is\nmade to find the causes behind it with\nthe help of qualitative and quantitative\nfacts of an economic problem. Once the\ncauses of the problem are identified, it\n2024-25"

                "text": "6 STATISTICS FOR ECONOMICS\nis easier to formulate certain policies\nto tackle it.\nBut there is more to Statistics. It\nenables an economist to present\neconomic facts in a precise and definite\nform that helps in proper\ncomprehension of what is stated. When\neconomic facts are expressed in\nstatistical terms, they become exact.\nExact facts are more convincing than\nvague statements. For instance,\nsaying that with pr ecise figur es, 310\npeople died in the r ecent earthquake\nin Kashmir , is mor e factual and, thus,\na statistical data. Whereas, saying\nhundreds of people died, is not.\nStatistics also helps in condensing\nmass data into a few numerical\nmeasur es (such as mean, variance\netc., about which you will lear n later).\nThese numerical measur es help to\nsummarise data. For example, it\nwould be impossible for you to\nremember the incomes of all the\npeople in a data if the number of\npeople is very lar ge. Y et, one can\nremember easily a summary figur e like\nthe average income that is obtained\nstatistically. In this way, Statistics\nsummarises and pr esents a\nmeaningful overall infor mation about\na mass of data.\nQuite often, Statistics is used in\nfinding r elationships between dif ferent\neconomic factors. An economist may\nbe inter ested in finding out what\nhappens to the demand for a\ncommodity when its price incr eases\nor decr eases? Or , would the supply of\na commodity be affected by the changes\nin its own price? Or , would theconsumption expenditure increase\nwhen the average income incr eases? Or ,\nwhat happens to the general price level\nwhen the government e xpenditure\nincreases? Such questions can only be\nanswered if any relationship exists\nbetween the various economic factors\nthat have been stated above. Whether\nsuch relationships exist or not can be\neasily verified by applying statistical\nmethods to their data. In some cases\nthe economist might assume certain\nrelationships between them and like\nto test whether the assumption she/he\nmade about the relationship is valid or\nnot. The economist can do this only by\nusing statistical techniques.\nIn another instance, the economist\nmight be inter ested in pr edicting the\nchanges in one economic factor due\nto the changes in another factor . For\nexample, she/he might be inter ested\nin knowing the impact of today’s\ninvestment on the national income in\nfutur e. Such an exer cise cannot be\nundertaken without the knowledge of\nStatistics.\nSometimes, formulation of plans\nand policies requires the knowledge of\nfuture trends. For example, an\neconomic planner has to decide in 2017\nhow much the economy should\nproduce in 2020. In other words, one\nmust know what could be the expected\nlevel of consumption in 2020 in order\nto decide the production plan of the\neconomy for 2020. In this situation,\none might make subjective judgement\nbased on the guess about consumption\nin 2020. Alternatively, one might use\nstatistical tools to predict consumption\n2024-25"

The decision\nto import would depend on the\nexpected domestic production of oil and\nthe likely demand for oil in 2025.\nWithout the use of Statistics, it cannot\nbe determined what the expected\ndomestic production of oil and the\nlikely demand for it would be. Thus,\nthe decision to import oil cannot be made\nunless we know the actual requirement\nof oil. This vital information that helps to\nmake the decision to import oil can only\nbe obtained statistically.\nStatistical methods ar e no substitute for common sense!\nThere is an interesting story which is told to make fun of statistics. It is\nsaid that a family of four persons (husband, wife and two children) once\nset out to cr oss a river . The father knew the average depth of the river . So,\nhe calculated the average height of his family members. Since the average\nheight of his family members was greater than the average depth of the\nriver, he thought they could cr oss safely.

In the following sections we will\ndiscuss the types of data, method and\ninstruments of data collection and\nsources of obtaining data.2.WHAT ARE THE SOURCES  OF DATA?\nStatistical data can be obtained from\ntwo sources. The researcher  may\ncollect the data by conducting an\nenquiry. Such  data are called Primary\nData,  as they are based on first hand\ninformation. Suppose, you want to\nknow about the popularity of a filmstar\namong school students. For  this, you\nwill have to enquire from a large\nnumber of school students, by asking\nquestions from them to collect the\ndesired information. The data you get,\nis an example of primary data.\nIf the data have been collected and\nprocessed (scrutinised and tabulated)\nby some other agency, they are called\nSecondary Data .  They can be obtained\neither from published sources such as\ngovernment reports, documents,\nnewspapers, books written by\neconomists or from any other source,\nfor example, a website. Thus, the data\nare primary  to the source that collects\nand processes them for the first time\nand secondary  for all sources that later\nuse such data. Use of secondary data\nsaves time and cost. For example, after\ncollecting the data on the popularity of\nthe filmstar among students, you\npublish a report. If somebody uses the\ndata collected by you for a similar\nstudy, it becomes secondary data.\n3.HOW DO WE C OLLECT  THE DATA?\nDo you know how a manufacturer\ndecides about a product or how a\npolitical party decides about a\ncandidate?

There are three basic ways of\ncollecting data: (i) Personal Interviews,\n(ii) Mailing (questionnaire) Surveys,\nand (iii) Telephone Interviews.\nPersonal Interviews\nThis method is\nused when the\nresearcher has\naccess to all the\nmembers. The\nresearcher (or\ninvestigator)\nconducts face-\nto-face interviews with the respondents.\nPersonal interviews are preferred\ndue to various reasons. Personal\ncontact is made between the\nrespondent and the interviewer . The\ninterviewer has the opportunity of\nexplaining the study and answering the\nqueries of respondents. The interviewer\ncan request the respondent to expand\non answers that are particularly\nimportant. Misinterpretation and\nmisunderstanding can be avoided.\nWatching the r eactions of  r espondents\ncan provide supplementary\ninformation.\nPersonal interview has some\ndemerits too. It is expensive, as it\nrequires trained interviewers. It takes\nlonger time to complete the survey.\nPresence of the researcher may inhibit\nrespondents from saying what they\nreally think.Mailing Questionnaire\nWhen the data in a survey are collected\nby mail, the questionnaire is sent to\neach individual by mail\nwith a request to\ncomplete and return it\nby a given date. The\nadvantages of this\nmethod are that, it is\nless expensive. It allows the researcher\nto have access to people in remote\nareas too, who might be difficult to\nreach in person or by telephone. It does\nnot allow influencing of the respondents\nby the interviewer . It also per mits the\nrespondents to take sufficient time to\ngive thoughtful answers to the\nquestions.\nThese days online surveys or\nsurveys through short messaging\nservice, i.e., SMS ar e popular . Do you\nknow how an online survey is\nconducted?\nThe disadvantages of mail survey\nare that there is less opportunity to\nprovide assistance in clarifying\ninstructions, so there is a possibility of\nmisunderstanding the questions.\nMailing is also likely to produce low\nresponse rates due to certain factors,\nsuch as returning the questionnaire\nwithout completing it, not returning the\nquestionnaire at all, loss of\nquestionnaire in the mail itself, etc.\nTelephone Interviews\nIn a telephone\ninterview, the\ninvestigator asks\nquestions over the\n2024-25"

They allow\nthe researcher to assist the respondent\nby clarifying the questions. Telephonic\ninterview is better in cases where the\nrespondents are reluctant to answer\ncertain questions in personal interviews.\nThe disadvantage of this method is\naccess to people, as many people may\nnot own telephones.\nPilot Survey\nOnce the questionnaire is ready, it is\nadvisable to conduct a try-out with a\nsmall group which is known as Pilot\nSurvey  or Pre-testing  of the\nquestionnaire. The pilot survey helps inproviding a preliminary idea about the\nsurvey. It helps in pre-testing  of the\nquestionnaire, so as to know the\nshortcomings and drawbacks of the\nquestions.

A\nhouse-to-house enquiry is carried out,\ncovering all households in India.\nDemographic data on birth and death\nrates, literacy, employment, life\nexpectancy, size and composition of\npopulation, etc., are collected and\npublished by the Registrar General of\nIndia. The last Census  of India was\nheld in 2011.According to the Census 2011,\npopulation of India was 121.09 crore,\nwhich was 102.87 crore in 2001.\nCensus 1901 indicated that the\npopulation of the country was 23.83\ncrore. Since then, in a period of 110\nyears, the population of the country has\nincreased by more than 97 crore.

A population\nis always all the  individuals/items who\npossess certain c haracteristics (or a\nset of characteristics),  according to the\npurpose of the survey. The first task in\nselecting a sample is to identify the\npopulation . Once the population is\nidentified, the researcher selects a\nmethod of studying it. If the researcher\nfinds that survey of the whole\npopulation is not possible, then he/\nshe may decide to select a\nRepresentative Sample . A sample\nrefers to a group or section of the\npopulation fr om which infor mation is\nto be obtained. A good  sample\n(representative sample) is generally\nsmaller than the population and is\ncapable of providing reasonably\naccurate information about the\npopulation at a much lower cost and\nshorter time.\n2024-25"

The\ngovernment wants to determine the\nimpact of the rise in petrol price on the\nhousehold budget of a particular\nlocality.

The average income\nof the selected group of individuals is\nused as an estimate of average income\nof the individuals of the entire region.\nExample\n•Research problem : To study the\neconomic condition of agricultural\nlabourers in Churachandpur district of\nManipur .\n•Population : All agricultural\nlabourers in Churachandpur district.\n•Sample : Ten per cent of the\nagricultural labourers in\nChurachandpur district.\nMost of the surveys are sample\nsurveys.

Sampling error refers to the\ndifference between the sample estimate\nand the corresponding population\nparameter (actual value of the\ncharacteristic of the population for\nexample, average income, etc).  Thus,\nthe difference between the actual\nvalue of a parameter of  the population\nand its estimate (from the sample) is\nthe sampling err or. It is possible to\nreduce the magnitude of sampling error\nby taking a larger sample.\nExample\nConsider a case of incomes of 5 farmers\nof Manipur . The variable x (income of\nfarmers) has measure-ments 500, 550,\n600, 650, 700. W e note that the\npopulation average  of\n(500+550+600+650+700)\n÷ 5 = 3000 ÷ 5 = 600.\nNow, suppose we select a sample\nof two individuals where x has\nmeasurements of 500 and 600. The\nsample average  is (500 + 600) ÷ 2\n= 1100 ÷ 2 = 550.\nHere, the sampling error  of the estimate\n= 600 (true value)  – 550 (estimate) = 50.\nNon-Sampling Errors\nNon-sampling errors are more serious\nthan sampling errors because a\nsampling error can be minimised by\ntaking a larger sample. It is difficult\nto minimise non-sampling  err or, even\nby taking a large sample. Even a\nCensus  can contain non-sampling\nerrors. Some of the non-sampling\nerrors are:Sampling Bias\nSampling bias occurs when the\nsampling plan is such that some\nmembers of the target population\ncould not possibly be included in the\nsample.\nNon-Response Errors\nNon-response occurs if an interviewer\nis unable to contact a person listed in\nthe sample or a person from the sample\nrefuses to respond. In this case, the\nsample observation may not be\nrepresentative.\nErrors in Data Acquisition\nThis type of error arises from\nrecording of incorrect responses.\nSuppose, the teacher asks the\nstudents to measure the length of the\nteacher’s table in the classroom. The\nmeasurement by the students may\ndiffer. The dif ferences may occur due\nto differences in measuring tape,\ncarelessness of the students , etc.\nSimilarly, suppose , we want to collect\ndata on prices of oranges. W e know\nthat prices vary from shop to shop\nand from market to market. Prices also\nvary according to the quality.\nTherefore, we can only consider the\naverage prices. Recording mistakes\ncan also take place as the\nenumerators or the respondents may\ncommit errors in recording or trans-\nscripting the data, for example, he/\nshe may record 13 instead of 31.\n6.

But when the same data is\nclassified according to gender,\neducation, marital status, occupation,\netc., the structure and nature of\npopulation of India is, then, easily\nunderstood.\nThe raw data consist of\nobservations on variables. The raw data\nas given in Tables 3.1 and 3.2 consist\nof observations on a specific or group\nof variables. Look at Table 3.1 for\ninstance which contains marks in\nmathematics scored by 100 students.\nHow can we make sense of these\nmarks? The mathematics teacher\nlooking at these marks would be\nthinking– How have my students done?\nHow many have not passed? How we\nclassify the data depends upon the\npurpose we have in mind. In this case,\nthe teacher wishes to understand in\nsome depth– how these students have\ndone.

Instead of\nclassifying your books according to\nsubjects — “History”, “Geography”,\n“Mathematics”, “Science” , etc. — you\ncould have classified them author -wise\nin an alphabetical or der. Or, you could\nhave also classified them according to\nthe year of publication. The way you\nwant to classify them would depend on\nyour requirement.\nLikewise the raw data is classified in\nvarious ways depending on the\npurpose. They can be grouped\naccording to time. Such a classification\nis known as a Chronological\nClassification.  In such a classification,\ndata are classified either in ascending or\nin descending order with reference to\ntime such as years, quarters, months,\nweeks, etc. The following example shows\nthe population of India classified in\nterms of years. The variable ‘population’\nis a Time Series  as it depicts a series of\nvalues for different years.\nExample 1\nPopulation of India (in crores)\nYear Population (Crores)\n1951 35.7\n1961 43.8\n1971 54.6\n1981 68.4\n1991 81.8\n2001 102.7\n2011 121.0\nIn Spatial Classification  the data\nare classified with reference to\ngeographical locations such as\ncountries, states, cities, districts, etc .\n2024-25"

For example, nationality,\nliteracy, religion, gender, maritalstatus, etc. They cannot be measured.\nYet these attributes  can be classified\non the basis of either the presence or\nthe absence of a qualitative\ncharacteristic.

They are broadly classified\ninto two types:\n(i)Continuous  and\n(ii)Discrete.\nA  continuous variable can take any\nnumerical value. It may take integral\nvalues (1, 2, 3, 4, ...), fractional values\n(1/2, 2/3, 3/4, ...), and values that are\nnot exact fractions ( 2=1.414,\n3=1.732, …  ,7=2.645). For example,\nthe height of a student, as he/she grows\nsay from 90 cm to 150 cm, would take\nall the values in between them. It can\ntake values that are whole numbers like\n90cm, 100cm, 108cm, 150cm.  It can\nalso take fractional values like 90.85\ncm, 102.34 cm, 149.99cm etc. that are\nnot whole numbers. Thus the variable\n“height” is capable of manifesting in\nevery conceivable value and its values\ncan also be\nbroken\ndown into\ninfinite\ngradations.\nOther examples of a continuous\nvariable are weight, time, distance, etc.\nUnlike a continuous variable, a\ndiscrete variable  can take only certain\nvalues. Its value changes only by finite\n“jumps”. It “jumps” from one value to\nanother but does not take any\nintermediate value between them. For\nexample, a variable like the “number\nof students in a class”, for different\nclasses, would assume values that are\nonly whole numbers. It cannot take any\nfractional value like 0.5 because “ half\nof a student” is absurd. Therefore it\n2024-25"

Is it a discrete\nvariable? Y es, because though X takes\nfractional values it cannot take any\nvalue between two adjacent fractional\nvalues.

Y ou will be wondering as to\nhow we got it from the\nraw data of Table 3.1. But, before we\naddress this question,\nyou must know what a frequency\ndistribution is.5. WHAT IS A FREQUENCY  DISTRIBUTION ?\nA frequency distribution  is a\ncomprehensive way to classify raw data\nof a quantitative variable. It shows how\ndifferent values of a variable (here, the\nmarks in mathematics scored by a\nstudent) are distributed in different\nclasses along with their corresponding\nclass frequencies. In this case we have\nten classes of marks: 0–10, 10–20, …  ,\n90–100. The term Class Frequency\nmeans the number of values in a\nparticular class. For example, in the\nclass 30– 40 we find 7 values of marks\nfrom raw data in Table 3.1. They are\n30, 37, 34, 30, 35, 39, 32. The\nfrequency of the class: 30–40 is thus\n7. But you might be wondering why\n40–which is occurring twice in the raw\ndata – is not included in the class 30–\n40. Had it been included the class\nfrequency of 30–40 would have been 9\ninstead of 7. The puzzle would be clear\nto you if you are patient enough to read\nthis chapter car efully. So carry on. Y ou\nwill find the answer yourself.\nEach class in a frequency\ndistribution table is bounded by Class\nLimits.  Class limits are the two ends of\na class. The lowest value is called the\nLower Class Limit  and the highest\nvalue the Upper Class Limit.  For\nexample, the class limits for the class:\n60–70 are 60 and 70. Its lower class\nlimit is 60 and its upper class limit is\n70. Class Interval or Class Width is\nthe difference between the upper class\nlimit and the lower class limit. For the\nclass 60–70, the class interval is 10\n(upper class limit minus  lower class\nlimit).\n2024-25"

For example,\nsuppose we have taken sample of 20\ncompanies from the list of companies\nbased in a city. Suppose that we collect\ninformation on sales and expenditur e\non advertisements from each\ncompany. In this case, we have\nbivariate sample data. Such bivariate\ndata can be summarised using  a\nBivariate Frequency Distribution.\nA Bivariate Frequency Distribution\ncan be defined as the frequency\ndistribution of two variables.\nTable 3.9 shows the frequency\ndistribution of two variables, sales and\nadvertisement expenditure (in Rs.\nlakhs) of 20 companies. The values of\nsales are classed in different columnsand the values of advertisement\nexpenditure are classed in different\nrows. Each cell shows the frequency of\nthe corresponding row and column\nvalues. For example, there are 3 firms\nwhose sales are between Rs 135 and\nRs145 lakh and their advertisement\nexpenditures are between Rs 64 and\nRs 66 thousand. The use of a bivariate\ndistribution would be taken up in\nChapter 8 on correlation.\n7. C ONCLUSION\nThe data collected from primary and\nsecondary sources are raw or\nunclassified. Once the data are\ncollected, the next step is to classify\nthem for further statistical analysis.\nClassification brings order in the data.\nThe chapter enables you to know how\ndata can be classified through\nfrequency distribution in a\ncompr ehensive manner .

In other words these\ncharacteristics can be measured\nquantitatively. For example, age, height,\nproduction, income, etc are quantitative\ncharacteristics. Classes are formed by\nassigning limits called class limits for the\nvalues of the characteristic under\nconsideration. An example of quantit-\native classification is given in Table 4.2.\nCalculate the missing figures in the Table.\nTABLE 4.2\nDistribution of 542 respondents by\ntheir age in an election study in Bihar\nAge group No. of\n(yrs) respondents Per cent\n20–30 3 0.55\n30–40 61 11.25\n40–50 132 24.35\n50–60 153 28.24\n60–70 ? ?\n70–80 51 9.41\n80–90 2 0.37\nAll ? 100.00\nSource:  Assembly election Patna central\nconstituency 2005, A.N.

When put together\nsystematically these parts form a table.\nThe most simple way of conceptualising\na table is to present the data in rows\nand columns alongwith some\nexplanatory notes. Tabulation can be\ndone using one-way, two-way or three-\nway classification depending upon the\nnumber of characteristics involved. A\ngood table should essentially have the\nfollowing:(i)Table Number\nTable number is assigned to a table for\nidentification purpose. If more than one\ntable is presented, it is the table\nnumber that distinguishes one table\nfrom another . It is given at the top or\nat the beginning of the title of the table.\nGenerally, table numbers are whole\nnumbers in ascending order if there are\nmany tables in a book. Subscripted\nnumbers, like 1.2, 3.1, etc., are also\nused for identifying the table according\nto its location. For example, Table 4.5\nshould be read as the fifth table of the\nfourth chapter , and so on\n(See Table  4.5).\n(ii)Title\nThe title of a table narrates about the\ncontents of the table. It has to be  clear ,\nbrief and carefully worded so that the\ninterpretations made from the table are\nclear and free from  ambiguity. It finds\nplace at the head of the table\nsucceeding the table number or just\nbelow it (See Table 4.5).\n(iii)Captions or Column Headings\nAt the top of each column in a table a\ncolumn designation is given to explain\nfigures of the column. This is\ncalled caption or column heading\n(See Table 4.5).\n(iv)Stubs or Row Headings\nLike a caption or column heading, each\nrow of the table has to be given a\nheading. The designations of the rows\nare also called stubs or stub items, and\nthe complete left column is known as\n2024-25"

Location of\nany one figure/data in the table is\nfixed and determined by the row and\ncolumn of the table.  For example, data\nin the second row and fourth column\nindicate that 25 crore females in ruralIndia were non-workers in 200 1(See\nTable 4.5).\n(vi)Unit of Measurement\nThe unit of measurement of the\nfigures in the table (actual data)\nshould always be stated alongwith\nthe title.

Diagrammatic presenta-\ntion of data translates quite effectively\nthe highly abstract ideas contained innumbers into more concrete and easily\ncomprehensible form.\nDiagrams may be less accurate but\nare much more effective than tables in\npresenting the data.\nThere are various kinds of diagrams\nin common use. Amongst them the\nimportant ones are the following:\n(i)Geometric diagram\n(ii)Frequency diagram\n(iii)Arithmetic line graph\nGeometric Diagram\nBar diagram and pie diagram come in\nthe category of geometric diagram. The\nbar diagrams are of three types — simple,\nmultiple and component bar diagrams.\nBar Diagram\nSimple Bar Diagram\nBar diagram comprises a group of\nequispaced and equiwidth rectangular\nbars for each class or category of data.\nHeight or length of the bar reads the\nmagnitude of data. The lower end of the\nbar touches the base line such that the\nheight of a bar starts from the zero unit.\nBars of a bar diagram can be visually\ncompared by their relative height and\naccordingly data are comprehended\nquickly. Data for this can be of\nfrequency or non-frequency type. In\nnon-frequency type data a particular\ncharacteristic, say production, yield,\npopulation, etc. at various points of\ntime or of different states are noted and\ncorresponding bars are made of the\nrespective heights according to the\nvalues of the characteristic to construct\nthe diagram.

It is a set of rectangles with\nbase  as  the intervals between class\nboundaries (along X-axis) and with\nareas proportional to the class\nfrequency (Fig.4.5). If the class intervals\nare of  equal width, which they generally\nare, the area of the rectangles are\nproportional to their respective\nfrequencies. However , in some type of\ndata, it is convenient, at times\nnecessary, to use varying width of class\nintervals. For example, when tabulating\ndeaths by age at death, it would be very\nmeaningful as well as useful too to have\nvery short age intervals (0, 1, 2, ..., yrs/\n0, 7, 28, ..., days) at the beginning\nwhen death rates are very high\ncompared to deaths at most other\nhigher age segments of the population.\nFor graphical representation of  such\ndata, height for area of a rectangle is\nthe quotient of height (here frequency)\nand base (here width of the class\ninterval). When intervals are equal, that\nis, when all rectangles have the same\nbase, area can conveniently be\nrepresented by the frequency of any\ninterval for purposes of comparison.When bases vary in their width, the\nheights of rectangles are to be adjusted\nto yield comparable measurements.\nThe answer in such a situation is\nfrequency density (class frequency\ndivided by width of the class interval)\ninstead of absolute frequency.\nTABLE 4.9\nDistribution of daily wage earners in a\nlocality of a town\nDaily No.\nearning of wage\n(Rs) earners (f)\n45–49 2\n50–54 3\n55–59 5\n60–64 3\n65–69 6\n70–74 7\n75–79 12\n80–84 13\n85–89 9\n90–94 7\n95–99 6\n100–104 4\n105–109 2\n110–114 3\n115–119 3\nSource:  Unpublished data\nSince histograms are rectangles, a line\nparallel to the base line and of the same\nmagnitude is to be drawn at a vertical\ndistance equal to frequency (or\nfrequency density) of the class interval.\nA histogram is never drawn.

It is the height\nand not the width or the area of the bar\nthat really matters.  A single vertical line\ncould have served the same purpose\nas a bar of same width. Mor eover , in\nhistogram no space is left between two\nrectangles, but in a bar diagram some\nspace must be left between consecutivebars (except in multiple bar or\ncomponent bar diagram). Although the\nbars have the same width, the width of\na bar is unimportant for the purpose\nof comparison.

ARITHMETIC  MEAN\nSuppose the monthly income (in Rs) of\nsix families is given as:\n1600, 1500, 1400, 1525, 1625, 1630.\nThe mean family income is\nobtained by adding up the incomes\nand dividing by the number of\nfamilies.\n= \n= Rs 1,547\nIt implies that on an average, a\nfamily ear ns Rs 1,547.\nArithmetic mean  is the most\ncommonly used measur e of central\ntendency. It is defined as the sum of\nthe values of all observations divided\nby the number of observations and is\nusually denoted by X . In general, if\nthere are N observations as X1, X2, X3,\n..., XN, then the Arithmetic Mean is given\nby\nX + X + X +...+ XN 1 2 3X=\nN\nThe right hand side can be written\nas 1X\nNN\ni i∑=. Here, i is an index\nwhich takes successive values 1, 2,\n3,...N.\nFor convenience, this will be written in\nsimpler form without the index i. Thus\nXX =\nN∑\n, where,  ΣX = sum of all\nobservations and N =  total number of\nobservations.\n2024-25"

For\nsimplicity we assume here that the\ncorrelation, if it exists, is linear , i.e. the\nrelative movement of the two variables\ncan be represented by drawing a\nstraight line on graph paper .\nTypes of Correlation\nCorrelation is commonly classified\ninto negative and positive\ncorrelation. The correlation is said to\nbe positive when the variables move\ntogether in the same direction. When\nthe income rises, consumption also\nrises.  When income falls,\nconsumption also falls. Sale of ice-\ncream and temperature move in the\nsame direction. The correlation is\nnegative when they move in opposite\ndirections. When the price of apples\nfalls its demand increases. When the\nprices rise its demand decreases.\nWhen you spend more time in\nstudying,  chances of your failing\ndecline. When you spend less hours\nin your studies , chances of scoring\nlow marks/grades increase. These\nare instances of negative correlation.\nThe variables move in opposite\ndirection.\n3.TECHNIQUES  FOR MEASURING\nCORRELATION\nThree important  tools used to  study\ncorrelation are scatter diagrams, Karl\nPearson’s coefficient of correlation and\nSpearman’s rank correlation.A scatter diagram visually presents\nthe nature of association without giving\nany specific numerical value.  A\nnumerical measure of linear\nrelationship between two variables is\ngiven by Karl Pearson’s coefficient of\ncorrelation.  A relationship is said to\nbe linear if it can be represented\nby a straight line. Spearman’s\ncoefficient of correlation measures the\nlinear association between ranks\nassigned to indiviual items according\nto their attributes. Attributes are those\nvariables which cannot be numerically\nmeasured such as intelligence of\npeople, physical appearance, honesty,\netc.\nScatter Diagram\nA scatter diagram is a useful\ntechnique for visually examining the\nform of relationship, without\ncalculating any numerical value. In\nthis technique, the values of the two\nvariables are plotted as points on a\ngraph paper . From a scatter diagram,\none can get a fairly good idea of the\nnature of relationship. In a scatter\ndiagram the degree of closeness of the\nscatter points and their overall direction\nenable us to examine the  relation-\nship. If all the points lie on a line, the\ncorrelation is perfect and is said to be\nin unity. If the scatter points are widely\ndispersed around the line, the\ncorrelation is low.

Thus, if the true\nrelation is of the linear type as shown\nby the scatter diagrams in figures 6.1,\n6.2, 6.4 and 6.5, then the Karl\nPearson’s coefficient of correlation\nshould be calculated and it will tell us\nthe direction and intensity of the\nrelation between the variables.

These ranks can then be\nused to calculate Spearman’s rank\ncorrelation coefficient.\n2. Suppose we are dealing with things\nsuch as fairness, honesty or beauty.\nThese cannot be measured in the\nsame way as we measure income,\nweight or height. At most, these\nthings can be measured relatively,\nfor example, we may be able to rank\npeople according to beauty (some\npeople would argue that even this\nis not possible because standards\nand criteria of beauty may differ\nfrom person to person and culture\nto culture). If we wish to find the\nrelation between variables, at least\none of which is of this type, then\nSpearman’s rank correlation\ncoefficient is to be used.\n3. Spearman’s rank correlation\ncoefficient can be used in some cases\nwhere there is a relation whose\ndirection is clear but which is non-\nlinear as shown when the scatter\ndiagrams are of the type shown in\nFigures 6.6 and 6.7.\n4.  Spearman’s correlation coefficient is\nnot affected by extreme values. In this\nrespect, it is better than Karl Pearson’s\ncorrelation coefficient. Thus if the data\ncontains some extreme values,\nSpearman’s correlation coefficient can\nbe very useful.\n Rank correlation coefficient and\nsimple correlation coefficient have the\nsame interpretation. Its formula has\nbeen derived from simple correlationcoefficient where individual values have\nbeen replaced by ranks. These ranks\nare used for the calculation of\ncorrelation. This coefficient  provides a\nmeasure of linear association between\nranks assigned to these units, not their\nvalues. The Spearman’s rank\ncorrelation formula is\n2\na 36 Dr 1\nn nÂ= -\n-...(4)\nwhere n is the number of observations\nand  D the deviation of ranks assigned\nto  a variable from those assigned to\nthe other variable.\nAll the properties of the simple\ncorrelation coefficient are applicable\nhere. Like the Pearsonian Coefficient of\ncorrelation  it lies between 1 and\n–1. However , generally it is not as\naccurate as the ordinary method. This\nis due the fact that all the information\nconcerning the data is not utilised.\nThe first difference is the difference\nof consecutive values. The first\ndifferences of the values of items in the\nseries, arranged in order of magnitude,\nare almost never constant. Usually the\ndata cluster around the central values\nwith smaller differences in the middle\nof the array.\nIf the first differences were constant,\nthen r and rk would give identical\nresults.

WHAT IS AN INDEX NUMBER\nAn index number is a statistical device\nfor measuring changes in the\nmagnitude of a group of related\nvariables. It  represents the general\ntrend of diverging ratios, from which it\nis calculated. It is a measure of the\naverage change in a group of related\nvariables over two different situations.\nThe comparison may be between like\ncategories such as persons, schools,\nhospitals etc. An index number also\nmeasures changes in the value of the\nvariables such as prices of specified list\nof commodities, volume of productionin different sectors of an industry,\nproduction of various agricultural\ncrops, cost of living etc.\nConventionally, index numbers are\nexpressed in terms of percentage. Of the\ntwo periods, the period with which the\ncomparison is to be made, is known as\nthe base period. The value in the base\nperiod is  given the index number 100.\nIf you want to know how much  the\nprice has changed in 2005 from  the\nlevel in 1990, then 1990 becomes the\nbase. The index number of any period\nis in proportion with it. Thus an index\nnumber of 250 indicates that the value\nis two and half times that of the base\nperiod.\nPrice index numbers measure and\npermit comparison of the prices of\ncertain goods. Quantity index numbers\nmeasure the changes in the physical\nvolume of  production, construction or\nemployment. Though price index\nnumbers are more widely used, a\nproduction index is also an important\nindicator of the level of the output in\nthe economy.\n2024-25"

CONSTRUCTION  OF AN INDEX NUMBER\nIn the following sections, the principles\nof constructing an index number will\nbe illustrated through price index\nnumbers.\nLet us look at th e following example:\nExample 1\nCalculation of simple aggregative price\nindex\nTABLE 7.1\nCommodity Base Current Percentage\nperiod period change\nprice (Rs) price (Rs)\nA 2 4 100\nB 5 6 20\nC 4 5 25\nD 2 3 50\nAs you observe in this example, the\npercentage changes are different for\nevery commodity. If the percentage\nchanges were the same for all four\nitems, a single measure would have\nbeen sufficient to describe the change.\nHowever , the per centage changes  dif fer\nand reporting the percentage change\nfor every item will be confusing. It\nhappens when the number of\ncommodities is large, which is common\nin any real market situation. A price\nindex represents these changes by a\nsingle numerical measure.\nThere are two methods of\nconstructing an index number . It can\nbe computed by the aggregative\nmethod and by the  method of\naveraging relatives.The Aggregative Method\nThe formula for a simple aggregative\nprice index  is\nPP\nP011\n0100 = ×Σ\nΣ\nWhere  P1 and P0 indicate the price\nof the commodity  in the current period\nand  base period respectively. Using the\ndata from example 1, the simple\naggregative price index is\nP014 6 5 3\n2 5 4 2100 138 5 =+ + +\n+ + +× = .\nHere, price is said to have risen by\n38.5 per cent.\nDo you know that such an index is\nof limited use? The reason is that  the\nunits of measurement of prices of\nvarious commodities are  not  the same.\nIt is unweighted, because the relative\nimportance of the items has not been\nproperly reflected. The items are treated\nas having equal importance or weight.\nBut what happens in reality? In reality\nthe items purchased differ in order of\nimportance.  Food items occupy a large\nproportion of our expenditure. In that\ncase  an equal rise in the price of an\nitem with large weight and that of an\nitem with low weight will have different\nimplications for the overall change in\nthe price index.\nThe formula for a weighted\naggregative price index  is\nPP q\nP q011 0\n0 0100 = ×Σ\nΣ\nAn index number becomes a\nweighted index when the relative\nimportance of items is taken care of.\n2024-25"

SOME IMPORTANT  INDEX NUMBERS\nConsumer price index\nConsumer price index (CPI), also\nknown as the cost of living index,measures the average change in retail\nprices. Consider the  statement that  the\nCPI for industrial workers (2001=100)\nis 277 in December 2014 . What does\nthis statement mean? It means that if\nthe industrial worker was spending\nRs 100 in 2001 for a typical basket of\ncommodities, he needs Rs 277 in\nDecember 2014 to be able to buy an\nidentical basket of commodities. It is\nnot necessary that he/she buys the\nbasket. What is important is whether\nhe has the capability to buy it.\nExample 4\nConstruction of consumer price index\nnumber .\nCPIWR\nW= = =Σ\nΣ9786 85\n10097 86..\nThis exercise shows that the cost of\nliving has declined by 2.14  per cent.\nWhat does an index larger than 100\nindicate? It means a higher cost of\nliving necessitating an upward\nadjustment in wages and salaries. The\nrise is equal to the amount, it exceeds\n100. If the index is 150, 50 per cent\nupward adjustment is required. The\nsalaries of the employees have to be\nraised by 50 per cent.\nTABLE 7.4\nItem Weight in % Base period Current period R=P1/P0 × 100 WR\nW price (Rs) price (Rs) (in%)\nFood 35 150 145 96.67 3883.45\nFuel 10 25 23 92.00 920.00\nCloth 20 75 65 86.67 1733.40\nRent 15 30 30 100.00 1500.00\nMisc. 20 40 45 112.50 2250.00\n9786.85\n2024-25"

Calculation of a\nvolume index will be inappropriate,\nwhen one needs a value i ndex.\n•Besides this, the items are not equally\nimportant for different groups of\nconsumers when  a consumer price\nindex is constructed. The rise in petrol\nprice may not directly impact the living\nconditi on of the poor agricultural\nlabourers. Thus  the items to be included\nin any index have to be selected carefully\nto  be as representative as possible.  Only\nthen you will get a meaningful picture of\nthe change.\n•Every index should have a base  year .\nThis base year should be as normal as\npossible. Y ears having extr eme values\nshould not be selected as base year . The\nperiod should also not belong to too far\nin the past. The comparison between\n1993 and 2005 is much more\nmeaningful than a comparison between\n1960 and 2005. Many items in a 1960\ntypical consumption basket  have\ndisappeared at present. Therefore, the\nbase year for any index number is\nroutinely updated.\n•Another issue is the choice of the\nformula, which depends on the nature\nof question to be studied. The only\ndifference between  the Laspeyre’s indexand Paasche’s index is the weights used\nin these formulae.\n•Besides, there are many sources of\ndata with different  degrees of reliability.\nData of poor reliability will  give\nmisleading results.

INDEX NUMBER  IN ECONOMICS\nWhy do we need to use the index\nnumbers? Wholesale price index number\n(WPI), consumer price index number\n(CPI) and industrial production index\n(IIP) are  widely used in policy making.\n•Consumer  index number (CPI) or\ncost of living index numbers are helpful\nin wage negotiation, formulation of\nincome policy, price policy, rent control,\ntaxation and general economic policy\nformulation.\n•The wholesale price index (WPI) is\nused to eliminate the effect of changes in\nprices on aggregates, such as  national\nincome, capital formation, etc.\n•The WPI is widely used to measure\nthe rate of inflation.

Y ou may like to addr ess certain\nwater or electricity problems relating to\nhouseholds of a particular ar ea. Y ou\nmay like to study about consumer\nawareness among households, i.e.,\nawareness about rights of consumers.\nChoice of Target Group\nThe choice or identification of the target\ngroup is important for framing\nappropriate questions for your\nquestionnaire. If your project relates\nto cars, then your target group will\nmainly be the middle income and the\nhigher income groups. For the project\nstudies relating to consumer products\nlike soap, you will target all rural and\nurban consumers. For the availability\nof safe drinking water your target\ngroup can be both urban and rural\npopulation. Therefore, the choice of\ntarget groups, to identify those\npersons on whom you  focus your\nattention, is very important while\npreparing the project report.\nCollection of Data\nThe objective of the survey will help you\nto determine whether the data\ncollection should be undertaken by\nusing primary method, secondary\nmethod or both the methods. As you\nhave read in Chapter 2, a first handcollection of data by using primary\nmethod can be done by using a\nquestionnaire or an interview schedule,\nwhich may be obtained by personal\ninterviews, mailing/postal surveys,\nphone, email, etc. Postal questionnaire\nmust have a covering  letter giving\ndetails about the purpose of inquiry.\nYour objective will be to deter mine the\nsize and characteristics of your target\ngroup.

If sampling is used in\nyour method of data collection, then\ncare has to be taken about the\nsuitability of the method of sampling.\nSecondary data can also be used\nprovided it suits your requirement.\nSecondary data are usually used when\nthere is paucity of time, money and\nmanpower resources and the\ninformation is easily available.\nOrganisation and Presentation of\nData\nAfter collecting the data, you need\nto process the information so\nreceived, by organising and\npresenting them with the help of\ntabulation and suitable diagrams,\ne.g. bar diagrams, pie diagrams, etc.\nabout which you have studied in\nchapter 3 and 4.\n2024-25"

A man may have six\nmeals one day and none the next, making an average of three meals\nper day, but that is not a good way to live.\nLouis D. BrandiesLouis D. BrandiesLouis D. BrandiesLouis D. BrandiesLouis D. Brandies\nThe weather man is never wrong. Suppose he says that there’s an\n80% chance of rain. If it rains, the 80% chance came up, if it doesn’t,\nthe 20% chance come up.\nSaul BarronSaul BarronSaul BarronSaul BarronSaul Barron\nThe death of one man is a tragedy.
