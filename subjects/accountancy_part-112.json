As the\nbusiness expands, one needs more capital and\nlarger number of people to manage the business and\nshare its risks. In such a situation, people usually\nadopt the partnership form of organisation.\nAccounting for partnership firms has it’s own\npeculiarities, as the partnership firm comes into\nexistence when two or more persons come together\nto establish business and share its profits. On many\nissues affecting distribution of profits, there may not\nbe any s pecific agreement between the partners. In\nsuch a situation the provisions of the Indian\nPartnership Act 1932 apply. Similarly, calculation\nof interest on capital, interest on drawings and\nmaintenance of partners capital accounts have their\nown peculiarities. Not only that a variety of\nadjustments are required on the death of a partner\nor when a new partner is admitted and so on. These\npeculiar situations need specific treatment in\naccounting that need to be clarified.\nThe present chapter discusses some basic\naspects of  partnership such as distribution of profit,\nmaintenance of capital accounts, etc. The treatment\nof situations like admission of partner , retir ement,\ndeath and dissolution have been taken up in the\nsubsequent chapters.\n1.1Nature of Partnership\nWhen two or more persons join hands  to set up a\nbusiness and share its profits and losses, they are\nsaid to be in partnership.

                "text": "2 Accountancy – Partnership Accounts\n‘relation between persons who have agreed to share the profits of a business\ncarried on by all or any of them acting for all’ .\nPersons who have entered into partnership with one another are individually\ncalled ‘partners’ and collectively called ‘firm’. The name under which the business\nis carried is called the ‘firm’s name’. A partnership firm has no separate legal\nentity, apart from the partners constituting it. Thus, the essential features of\npartnership are:\n1.Two or More Persons:  In order to form partnership, there should be at\nleast two persons coming together for a common goal. In other words,\nthe minimum number of partners in a fir m can be two. Ther e is however ,\na limit on their maximum number . By virtue of Section 464 of the\nCompanies Act 2013, the Central Government is empowered to prescribe\nmaximum number of partners in a firm but the number of partners can\nnot be more than 100. The Central government has prescribed the\nmaximum number of partness in a firm to be 50.\n2.Agreement:  Partnership is the result of an agreement between two or\nmore persons to do business and share its profits and losses. The\nagreement becomes the basis of relationship between the partners. It is\nnot necessary that such agreement is in written form. An oral agreement\nis equally valid. But in order to avoid disputes, it is preferred that the\npartners have a written agreement.\n3.Business:  The agreement should be to carry on some business. Mere co-\nownership of a property does not amount to partnership. For example, if\nRohit and Sachin jointly purchase a plot of land, they become the joint\nowners of the property and not the partners. But if they are in the business\nof purchase and sale of land for the purpose of making profit, they will\nbe called partners.\n4.Mutual Agency:  The business of a partnership concern may be carried\non by all the partners or any of them acting for all. This statement has\ntwo important implications. First, every partner is entitled to participate\nin the conduct of the affairs of its business. Second, that there exists a\nrelationship of mutual agency between all the partners. Each partner\ncarrying on the business is the principal as well as the agent for all the\nother partners. He can bind other partners by his acts and also is bound\nby the acts of other partners with regard to business of the firm.\nRelationship of mutual agency is so important that one can say that\nthere would be no partnership, if the element of mutual agency is absent.\n5.Sharing of Profit:  Another important element of partnership is that, the\nagreement between partners must be to share profits and losses of a\nbusiness. Though the definition contained in the Partnership Act describes\npartnership as relation between people who agree to share the profits of\na business, the sharing of loss is implied. Thus, sharing of profits and\n2024-25"

If some persons join hands for the purpose of some\ncharitable activity, it will not be termed as partnership.\n6.Liability of Partners:  Each partner is liable jointly with all the other\npartners and also severally to the third party for all the acts of the firm\ndone while he is a partner . Not only that the liability of a partner for acts\nof the firm is also unlimited. This implies that his private assets can also\nbe used for paying off the firm’s debts.\n1.2 Partnership Deed\nPartnership comes into existence as a result of agreement among the partners.\nThe agreement can be either oral or written. The Partnership Act does not require\nthat the agreement must be in writing. But wherever it is in writing, the document,\nwhich contains terms of the agreement  is called ‘Partnership Deed’. It generally\ncontains the details about all the aspects affecting the relationship between the\npartners including the objective of business, contribution of capital by each\npartner , ratio in which the pr ofits and the losses will be shar ed by the partners\nand entitlement of partners to interest on capital, interest on loan, etc.\nThe clauses of partnership deed can be altered with the consent of all the\npartners . The deed should be properly drafted and prepared as per the provisions\nof the ‘Stamp Act’ and preferably registered with the Registrar of Firms.\nContents of the Partnership Deed\nThe Partnership Deed usually contains the following details:\n•Names and Addresses of the firm and its main business;\n•Names and Addresses of all partners;\n•Amount of capital to be contributed by each partner;\n•The accounting period of the firm;\n•The date of commencement of partnership;\n•Rules regarding operation of Bank Accounts;\n•Profit and loss sharing ratio;\n•Rate of interest on capital, loan, drawings, etc;\n•Mode of auditor’s appointment, if any;\n•Salaries, commission, etc, if payable to any partner;\n•The rights, duties and liabilities of each partner;\n•Treatment of loss arising out of insolvency of one or more partners;\n•Settlement of accounts on dissolution of the firm;\n•Method of settlement of disputes among the partners;\n•Rules to be followed in case of admission, retirement, death of a partner; and\n•Any other matter relating to the conduct of business.\nNormally, the partnership deed covers all matters affecting relationship of\npartners amongst themselves. However , if ther e is no expr ess agr eement on\ncertain matters, the provisions of the Indian Partnership Act, 1932 shall apply.\n2024-25"

Thus, no interest on capital is payable if the partnership deed\nis silent on the issue.\n(c)Interest on Drawings:  No interest is to be charged on the drawings made\nby the partners, if there is no mention in the Deed.\n(d)Interest on Loan:  If any partner has advanced loan to the firm for the\npurpose of business, he/she shall be entitled to get an interest on the\nloan amount at the rate of 6 per  cent per annum.\n(e)Remuneration for Fir m’s W ork: No partner is entitled to get salary or\nother remuneration for taking part in the conduct of the business of the\nfirm unless there is a provision for the same in the Partnership Deed.\nApart from the above, the Indian Partnership Act specifies that subject to\ncontract between the partners:\n(i)If a partner derives any profit for him/her self from any transaction of the\nfirm or from the use of the property or business connection of the firm or\nthe firm name, he/she shall account for the profit and pay it to the firm.\n(ii)If a partner carries on any business of the same nature as and competing\nwith that of the firm, he/she shall account for and pay to the firm, all\nprofit made by him/her in that business.\nTest your Understanding – I\n1.Mohan and Shyam are partners in a firm.

The r emaining aspects have been cover ed in the\nsubsequent chapters.\n1.4 Maintenance of Capital Accounts of Partners\nAll transactions relating to partners of the firm are recorded in the books of the\nfirm through their capital accounts. This includes the amount of money brought\nin as capital, withdrawal of capital, share of profit, interest on capital, interest\non drawings, partner’s salary, commission to partners, etc.\nThere are two methods by which the capital accounts of partners can be\nmaintained. These are: (i) fixed capital method, and (ii) fluctuating capital\nmethod. The difference between the two lies in whether or not the transactions\nother than addition/withdrawal of capital are recorded in the capital accounts\nof the partners.\n(a)Fixed Capital Method:  Under the fixed capital method, the capitals of the\npartners shall remain fixed unless additional capital is introduced or a\npart of the capital is withdrawn as per the agreement among the partners.\nAll items like share of profit or loss, interest on capital, drawings, interest\non drawings, etc. are recorded in a separate accounts, called Partner’s\nCurrent Account. The partners’ capital accounts will always show a credit\nbalance, which shall remain the same (fixed) year after year unless there\nis any addition or withdrawal of capital. The partners’ current account\non the other hand, may show a debit or a credit balance. Thus under\nthis method, two accounts are maintained for each partner viz., capital\naccount and current account, While the partners’ capital accounts shall\nalways appear on the liabilities side in the balance sheet, the partners’\ncurrent account’s balance shall be shown on the liabilities side, if they\nhave credit balance and on the assets side, if they have debit balance.\nThe partner’s capital account and the current account under the fixed capital\nmethod would appear as shown in Fig.1.1.\n2024-25"

Show the distribution of profit amongst the partners.\n1.7  Past Adjustments\nSometimes a few omissions or errors in the recording of transactions or the\npreparation of summary statements are found after the final accounts have been\nprepared and the profits distributed among the partners. The omission may be\nin respect of interest on capitals, interest on drawings, interest on partners’ loan,\npartner’s salary, partner’s commission or outstanding expenses. There may also\nbe some changes in the provisions of partnership deed or system of accounting\nhaving impact with retrospective effect. All these acts of omission and commission\nneed adjustments for correction of their impact. Instead of altering old accounts,\nnecessary adjustments can be made either; (a) through ‘Profit and Loss\nAdjustment Account’, or (b) directly in the capital accounts of the concerned\npartners. This is explained with the help of following example.\nRameez and Zaheer are equal partners. Their capitals as on April 01, 2015\nwere Rs. 50,000 and Rs. 1,00,000 respectively. After the accounts for the financial\nyear ending March 31, 2016 have been prepared, it is discovered that interest at\nthe rate of 6 per cent per annum, as provided in the partnership deed has not\nbeen credited to the partners’ capital accounts before distribution of profit. In\nthis case, the interest on capital not credited to the partners’ capital accounts\nworks out to be Rs. 3000 (6/100  × Rs. 50,000) for Rameez and Rs. 6,000\n(6/100  × Rs. 1,00,000) for Zaheer . Had the inter est on capital been duly pr ovided,\nthe firm’s profit would have reduced by Rs. 9,000. By this omission, the whole\namount of  profit as per Profit and Loss Account (without adjustment of Rs.\n9,000) has been distributed among the partners in their profit sharing ratio,\nand the amounts of interest on capital have not been credited to their capital\naccounts. This error can be rectified in any of the following ways;\n(a)Through Profit and Loss Adjustment Account\n(i) Profit and Loss Adjustment A/c Dr. 9,000\nTo Rameez’s capital A/c 3,000\nTo Zaheer’s capital A/c 6,000\n   (Interest on capital)\n2024-25"

Any change in the existing agreement\namounts to reconstitution of the partnership firm.\nThis results in an end of the existing agreement and\na new agreement comes into being with a changed\nrelationship among the members of the partnership\nfirm and/or their composition. However , the fir m\ncontinues. The partners often resort to reconstitution\nof the firm in various ways such as admission of a\nnew partner , change in pr ofit sharing ratio,\nretirement of a partner , death or insolvence of a\npartner . In this chapter we shall have a brief idea\nabout all these and in detail about the accounting\nimplications of admission of a new partner or an on\nchange in the profit sharing ratio.\n2.1Modes of Reconstitution of a Partnership\nFirm\nReconstitution of a partnership fir m usually takes\nplace in any of the following ways:\nAdmission of a new partner:  A new partner may be\nadmitted when the firm needs additional capital or\nmanagerial help. According to the provisions of\nPartnership Act 1932 unless it is otherwise provided\nin the partnership deed a new partner can be\nadmitted only when the existing partners\nunanimously agree for it. For example, Hari and\nHaqque are partners sharing profits in the ratio ofReconstitution of a Partnership Firm –\nAdmission of a Partner\n2024-25"

With this change now there are three partners of the firm and\nit stands reconstituted.\nChange in the profit sharing ratio among the existing partners:  Sometimes the\npartners of a firm may decide to change their existing profit sharing ratio. This\nmay happen an account of a change in the existing partners’ role in the firm. For\nexample, Ram, Mohan and Sohan are partners in a firm sharing profits in the\nratio of 3:2:1. With effect from April 1,2017 they decided to share profits equally\nas Sohan brings in additional capital. This results in a  change in the existing\nagreement leading to reconstitution of the firm.\nRetirement of an existing partner:  It means withdrawal by a partner from the\nbusiness of the firm which may be due to his bad health, old age or change in\nbusiness interests. In fact a partner can retire any time if the partnership is at\nwill. For example, Roy, Ravi and Rao are partners in the firm sharing profits in\nthe ratio of 2:2:1.  On account of illness, Ravi retired from the firm on March 31,\n2017.  This results in reconstitution of the firm now having only two partners.\nDeath of a partner: Partnership may also stand reconstituted on death of a\npartner , if the r emaining partners decide to continue the business of the fir m as\nusual. For example, X,Y and Z are partners in a firm sharing profits in the ratio\n3:2:1. X died on March 31, 2017. Y and Z decide to carry on the business sharing\nfuture profits equally. The continuity of business by Y and Z sharing future\nprofits equally leads to reconstitution of the firm.\n2.2Admission of a New Partner\nWhen firm requires additional capital or managerial help or both for the\nexpansion of its business a new partner may be admitted to supplement its\nexisting resources.  According to the Partnership Act 1932, a new partner can\nbe admitted into the firm only with the consent of all the existing partners unless\notherwise agr eed upon. W ith the admission of a new partner , the partnership\nfirm is reconstituted and a new agreement is entered into to carry on the business\nof the firm.\nA newly admitted partner acquires two main rights in the firm–\n1.Right to share the assets of the partnership firm; and\n2.Right to share the profits of the partnership firm.\nFor the right to acquire share in the assets and profits of the partnership\nfirm, the partner brings an agreed amount of capital either in cash or in kind.\nMoreover , in the case of an established fir m which may be ear ning mor e profits\nthan the normal rate of return on its capital the new partner is required to\ncontribute some additional amount known as premium or goodwill. This is done\n2024-25"

But, what will be the shar e of\nnew partner and how he will acquire it from the existing partners is decided\nmutually among the old partners and the new partner . However , if nothing is\nspecified as to how does the new partner acquire his share from the old partners;\nit may be assumed that he gets it from them in their profit sharing ratio. In any\ncase, on admission of a new partner , the pr ofit sharing ratio among the old\npartners will change keeping in view their respective contribution to the profit\nsharing ratio of the incoming partner .  Hence, ther e is a need to ascertain the new\nprofit sharing ratio among all the partners. This depends upon how does the\nnew partner acquires his share from the old partners for which there are many\npossibilities. Let us understand it with the help of the following illustrations.\nIllustration 1\nAnil and Vishal are partners sharing profits in the ratio of 3:2.  They admitted\nSumit as a new partner for 1/5 share in the future profits of the firm.  Calculate\nnew profit sharing ratio of Anil, Vishal and Sumit.\nSolution\nSumit’s share =1\n5\nRemaining share =11\n5 =4\n5\nAnil’s new share =3\n5  of4\n5=12\n25\nVishal’s new share =2\n5  of4\n5=8\n25\nNew profit sharing ratio of Anil, Vishal and Sumit will be 12:8:5.\nNote: It has been assumed that the new partner acquired his share from old partners in\nold ratio.\n2024-25"

This helps the business\nto earn more profits as compared to a newly set up business. In accounting, the\nmonetary value of such advantage is known as “goodwill”.\nIt is as an intangible asset. In other words, goodwill is the value of the\nreputation of a firm in respect of the profits expected in future over and above\nthe normal profits.

Thus, goodwill exists only when the firm earns super\nprofits. Any firm that earns normal profits or is incurring losses has no goodwill.\n2.5.2 Factors Affecting the Value of Goodwill\nThe main factors affecting the value of goodwill are as follows:\n1.Nature of business:  A firm that produces high value added products or\nhaving a stable demand is able to earn more profits and therefore has\nmore goodwill.\n2.Location:  If the business is centrally located or is at a place having heavy\ncustomer traffic, the goodwill tends to be high.\n3.Efficiency of management:   A well-managed concern usually enjoys the\nadvantage of high productivity and cost efficiency. This leads to higher\nprofits and so the value of goodwill will also be high.\n4.Market situation:   The monopoly condition or limited competition enables\nthe concern to earn high profits which leads to higher value of goodwill.\n5.Special advantages:  The firm that enjoys special advantages like import\nlicences, low rate and assured supply of electricity, long-term contracts\nfor supply of materials, well-known collaborators, patents, trademarks,\netc. enjoy higher value of goodwill.\n2.5.3 Need for Valuation of Goodwill\nNormally, the need for valuation of goodwill arises at the time of sale of a business.\nBut, in the context of a partnership firm it may also arise in the following\ncircumstances:\n1.Change in the profit sharing ratio amongst the existing partners;\n2.Admission of new partner;\n3.Retirement of a partner;\n4.Death of a partner; and\n5.Dissolution of a firm involving sale of business as a going concern.\n6.Amalgamation of partnership firms.\n2.5.4 Methods of Valuation of Goodwill\nSince goodwill is an intangible asset it is very difficult to accurately calculate its\nvalue. V arious methods have been advocated for the valuation of goodwill of a\npartnership firm. Goodwill calculated by one method may differ from the goodwill\n2024-25"

Hence, the person who purchases a running business must pay in\nthe form of goodwill a sum which is equal to the profits he is likely to receive for\nthe first few years. The goodwill, therefore, should be calculated by multiplying\nthe past average profits by the number of years during which the anticipated\nprofits are expected to accrue.\nFor example, if the past average profits of a business works out at Rs. 20,000\nand it is expected that such profits are likely to continue for another three years,\nthe value of goodwill will be Rs. 60,000 (Rs. 20,000  3),\nIllustration 9\nThe profit for the five years of a firm are as follows – year 2013 Rs. 4,00,000;\nyear 2014 Rs. 3,98,000; year 2015 Rs. 4,50,000; year 2016 Rs. 4,45,000 and\nyear 2017 Rs. 5,00,000.

Hence, the person\nwho purchases an existing business has to pay in the form of goodwill a sum\nequal to the total profits he is likely to receive for the first ‘few years’. But it is\ncontended that the buyer’s real benefit does not lie in total profits; it is limited\nto such amounts of profits which are in excess of the normal return on capital\nemployed in similar business. Therefore, it is desirable to value, goodwill on\nthe basis of the excess profits and not the actual profits. The excess of actual\nprofits over the normal profits is termed as super profits.\nNormal Profit  =  Firm’s Capital × Normal Rate of Return\n100\nFirms capital includes partners capital and reserves and surplus but excludes\nfictitious assets and goodwill.\nSuppose an existing firm earns Rs. 18,000 on the capital of Rs. 1,50,000\nand the normal rate of return is 10%. The Normal profits will work out at\nRs. 15,000 (1,50,000 × 10/100). The super profits in this case will be Rs. 3,000\n(Rs. 18,000 – 15,000). The goodwill under the super profit method is ascertained\nby multiplying the super profits by certain number of years’ purchase. If, in the\nabove example, it is expected that the benefit of super profits is likely to be\navailable for 5 years in future, the goodwill will be valued at Rs. 15,000\n(3,000 × 5). Thus, the steps involved under the method are:\n1.Calculate the average profit,\n2.Calculate the normal profit on the firm’s capital on the basis of the normal\nrate of return,\n3.Calculate the super profits by deducting normal profit from the average\nprofits, and\n4.Calculate goodwill by multiplying the super profits by the given number\nof years’ purchase.\n2024-25"

The amount of goodwill\nworked out by this method will be exactly the same as calculated by capitalising the\naverage profits.\nFor example, using the data given in illustration 14 where the average profits are Rs.\n1,00,000 and the normal profits are Rs. 82,000 (10% of Rs. 8,20,000), the super profits\nworked out as Rs. 18,000 (Rs. 1,00,000 – Rs. 82,000), the goodwill will be calculated as\nfollows.\nRs. 18,000 × 100\n10 = Rs. 1,80,000.\nIllustration 15\n1.The goodwill of a firm is to be worked out at three years’ purchase of the\naverage profits of the last five years which are as follows:\nYears Profits (Loss)\n(Rs.)\n2012 10,000\n2013 15,000\n2014 4,000\n2015 (5,000)\n2016 6,000\n2.The capital of the firm is Rs. 1,00,000 and normal rate of return is 8%,\nthe average profits for last 5 years are Rs. 12,000 and goodwill is to be\nworked out at 3 years’ purchase of super profits,\n3.Rama Brothers earn an average profit of Rs. 30,000 with a capital of\nRs. 2,00,000. The normal rate of return in the business is 10%. Using\ncapitalisation of super profits method work out the value the goodwill of\nthe firm.\n2024-25"

They admitted C as a new partner for\none-third share in the profit. C brings in Rs. 60,000 as his capital.  Based on the\namount brought in by C and his share in profit, the total capital of the newly\nconstituted firm works out to be Rs.1,80,000 (Rs. 60,000 × 3). But the actual\ntotal capital of A, B and C works out as Rs. 1,50,000 (Rs. 45,000 + Rs. 45,000\n+ Rs. 60,000). Hence, it can be inferred that the difference is on account of goodwill\ni.e., Rs. 30,000 (Rs. 1,80,000 – Rs. 1,50,000). Which is to be shared equally (old\nratio) by A and B. This shall raise their capital accounts to Rs. 60,000 each and\ntotal capital of the firm to Rs. 1,80,000. In this, C’s Current account will be\ndebited by Rs. 10,000 (his share of goodwill) and A and B’s Capital accounts\ncredited by Rs. 5,000 each.\nIllustration 21\nHem and Nem are partners in a fi rm sharing profits in the ratio of 3:2.

This reduces\nthe old partners’ share in profits. Hence, the problem of determining the new\nprofit sharing ratio simply involves the determination of old partners’ new share\nin the profits of the  reconstituted firm. Given the new partners’ share in profits\nand the ratio, in which he acquires it from the old partners, the new share of\neach old partner shall be worked out by deducting his share of sacrifice from\nhis old share in profits. The ratio in which the old partners have agreed to\nsacrifice their shares in profit in favour of the new partner is called the\nsacrificing ratio. It is usually same as the old pr ofit sharing ratio. However ,\nbased on the agreement it can be different also.\n3.Treatment of Goodwill: Goodwill is an intangible asset and belonges to its owner\nat a point of time. On the admission of a new partner the goodwill of the firm\nbelongs to the old partners. It means that on the admission of a new partner\nsome adjustments must be made into the capital accounts of the old  partners\nfor goodwill so that the new partner will not acquire a share in that profit\nwhich the firm earns because of its goodwill earned before admission without\nmaking any payment for the same. The amount that the new partner pays for\ngoodwill is called goodwill. From accounting point of view the firm may have to\nface different situations for the treatment of goodwill at the time of admission of\na partner . The amount of pr emium br ought in by the new partner is shar ed by\nold partners in the ratio of sacrifice. In case the new partner fails to bring his\n2024-25"

Any gain or loss arising from such exercise\nshall be distributed among the old partner’s in their old profit sharing ratio.\n5.Adjustment for reserves and accumulated profits/losses: If, at the time of\nadmission of a partner , any r eserve and accumulated pr ofits or losses exist in\nbooks of the firm, these should be transferred to old partner’s capital/current\naccounts in their old profit sharing ratio.\n6.Determining/Adjusting partners’ capital:  If agreed, the partner’s capital may\nbe adjusted so as to be proportionate to their new profit sharing ratio. In that\ncase, the new partner’s capital is normally used as a base for  determining the\nnew capitals of the old partners and necessary adjustment made through case\nor by transfer to partner’s current accounts. Other basis also may be available\nfor determining capitals of the partners after admissioin of the new partner\nlike sharing the total capital to be in the firm immeidately after admission of\nthe new partner .\n7.Change in profit sharing ratio:  Sometimes the partners of a firm may agree to\nchange their existing profit sharing ratio. With a result, some partners will\ngain in future profits while others will lose.

The new shar e of each\nof the remaining partner will consist of his own share in the firm plus the share\nacquir ed from the r etiring /deceased partner .\n      Consider the following situations :\n(a)normally, the continuing partners acquire the share of retiring or deceased\npartners in the old profit sharing ratio, and there is no need to compute the\nnew profit sharing ratio among them, as it will be same as the old profit\nsharing ratio among them. In fact, in the absence of any information regarding\nprofit sharing ratio in which the remaining partners acquire the share of\nretiring/deceased partner , it is assumed that they will acquir e it in the old\nprofit sharing ratio and so share the future profits in their old ratio. For\nexample, Asha, Deepti and Nisha are partners in a firm sharing profits and\nlosses in the ratio of 3:2:1. If Deepti retires, the new profit sharing ratio\nbetween Asha and Nisha will be 3:1, unless they decide otherwise.\n(b)The continuing partners may acquire the share in the profits of the\nretiring/deceased partner in a proportion other than their old ratio, In that\ncase, there is need to compute the new profit sharing ratio among them .\nFor example:  Naveen, Suresh and Tarun are partners sharing profits and\nlosses in the ratio of 5:3:2. Suresh retires from the firm and his share was\n2024-25"

Normally, the continuing\npartners acquire th e share of retiring/deceased partner in their old profit sharing\nratio, In that case, the gaining ratio of the remaining partners will be the same\nas their old profit sharing ratio among them and there is no need to compute the\ngaining ratio, Alternatively, proportion in which they acquire the share of the\nretiring/deceased partner may be duly spacified. In that case, again, there is no\nneed to calculate the gaining ratio as it will be the ratio in which they have\nacquir ed the shar e of profit fr om the r etiring deceased partner . The pr oblem of\ncalculating gaining ratio arises primarily when the new profit sharing ratio of\nthe continuing partners is specified. In such a situation, the gaining ratio should\nbe calculated by, deducting the old share of each continuing partners from his\nnew share i.e., new profit share minus old profit share, i.e., new profit share\nminus  old profit share. For example, Amit, Dinesh and Gagan are partners\nsharing profits in the ratio of 5:3:2.\nDinesh retires. Amit and Gagan decide to share the profits of the new firm in\nthe ratio of  3:2. The g aining ratio will be calculated as follows :\n2024-25"

In such\na situation while the existing partnership is dissolved,\nthe firm may continue under the same name if the\npartners so decide. In other words, it results in the\ndissolution of a partnership but not that of the firm.\nAccording to Section 39 of the partnership Act 1932,\nthe dissolution of partnership between all the partners\nof a firm is called the dissolution of the firm. That\nmeans the Act recognises the difference in the\nbreaking of relationship between all the partners of a\nfirm and between some of the partners; and it is the\nbreaking or discontinuance of relationship between\nall the partners which is termed as the dissolution of\npartnership firm. This brings an end to the existence\nof firm, and no business is transacted after\ndissolution except the activities related to closing of\nthe firm as the affairs of the firm are to be wound up\nby selling firm’s assets and paying its liabilities and\ndischarging the claims of the partners.\n4.1  Dissolution of Partnership\nAs stated earlier dissolution of partnership changes\nthe existing relationship between partners but the\nfirm may continue its business as before. The\ndissolution of partnership may take place in any of\nthe following ways:\n(1)Change in existing profit sharing ratio among\npartners;\n(2)Admission of a new partner;LEARNING  OBJECTIVES\nAfter studying this chapter\nyou will be able to :\n•State the meaning of\ndissolution of\npartnership firm;\n•Differentiate between\ndissolution of partner -\nship and dissolution of\na partnership firm;\n•Describe the various\nmodes of dissolution of\nthe partnership firm;\n•Explain the rules\nrelating to the\nsettlement of claims\namong all partners;\n•Prepare Realisation\nAccount;Dissolution of Partnership Firm 4\n2024-25"

                "text": "159 Dissolution of Partnership Firm\n4.3 Settlement of Accounts\nIn case of dissolution of a firm, the firm ceases to conduct business and has to\nsettle its accounts. For this purpose, it disposes off all its assets for satisfying all\nthe claims against it. In this context it should be noted that, subject to agreement\namong the partners, the following rules as provided in Section 48 of the\nPartnership Act 1932 shall apply.\n(a)Treatment of Losses\nLosses, including deficiencies of capital, shall be paid :\n(i)first out of profits,\n(ii)next out of capital of partners, and\n(iii)lastly, if necessary, by the partners individually in their profit sharing ratio.\n(b)Application of Assets\nThe assets of the firm, including any sum contributed by the partners to make\nup deficiencies of capital, shall be applied in the following manner and order:\n(i)In paying the debts of the firm to the third parties;\n(ii)In paying each partner proportionately what is due to him/her from the\nfirm for advances as distinguished from capital (i.e. partner’ loan);\n(iii)In paying to each partner proportionately what is due to him on account\nof capital; and\n(iv)the residue, if any, shall be divided among the partners in their profit\nsharing ratio.\nThus, the amount realised from assets along with contribution from partners, if\nrequired, shall be utilised first to pay off the outside liabilities of the firm such as\ncreditors, loans, bank overdraft, bill payables, etc. (it may be noted that secured\nloans have precedence over the unsecured loans); the balance should be applied\nto repay loans made by the partners to the firm. (in case the balance amount is\nnot adequate enough to pay off such loans and advances, they are to be paid\npropartionately). The amount left thereafter is utilised in settlement of capital\naccount balances. Then the surplus if any is divided among partners in their\nprofit sharing ratio.\nPrivate Debts and Firm’s Debts:  Where both the debts of the firm and private debts of\na partner co-exist, the following rules, as stated in Section 49 of the Act, shall apply.\n(a)The property of the firm shall be applied first in the payment of debts of the\nfirm and then the surplus, if any, shall be divided among the partners as\nper their claims, which can be utilised for payment of their private liabilities.\n(b)The private property of any partner shall be applied first in payment of\nhis private debts and the surplus, if any, may be utilised for payment of\nthe firm’s debts, in case the firm’s liabilities exceed the firm’s assets.\nIt may be noted that the private property of the partner does not include the\npersonal properties of his wife and children. Thus, if the assets of the firm are\nnot adequate enough to pay off firm’s liabilities, the partners have to contribute\nout of their net private assets (private assets minus private liabilities).\n2024-25"

In the absence of any agreement, to the contrary, such a capital loss is\nto be borne by the remaining solvent partners in accordance with the principle laid\ndown in Garner vs. Murray case, which states that the solvent partners have to bear\nsuch loss in the ratio of their capitals as on the date of dissolution. However , the\naccounting treatment relating to dissolution of partnership on account of insolvency\nof partners is not being taken up at this stage.\n4.4 Accounting Treatment\nWhen the firm is dissolved, its books of account are to be closed and the profit or\nloss arising on realisation of its assets and discharge of liabilities is to be\ncomputed. For this purpose, a Realisation Account is prepared to ascertain the\nnet effect (profit or loss) of realisation of assets and payment of liabilities which\nmay be is transferred to partner’s capital accounts in their profit sharing ratio.\nHence, all assets (other than cash in hand bank balance and fictitious assets, if\nany), and all external liabilities are transferred to this account. It also records\nthe sale of assets, and payment of liabilities and realisation expenses.

This does not necessarily involve dissolution\nof the firm.\n3.Realisation Account : The Realisation Account is prepared to record the\ntransactions relating to sale and realisation of assets and settlement of creditors.\nAny profit or loss arising act of this process is shared by partners’ in their\nprofit sharing ratio.
