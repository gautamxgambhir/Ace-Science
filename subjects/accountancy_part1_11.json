But, today’s rapidly \nchanging business environment has forced the \naccountants to reassess their roles and functions both within the organisation and the society. The role of an accountant has now shifted from that of a mere recorder of transactions to that of the member providing relevant information to the decision-making team. Broadly speaking, accounting today is much more than just book-keeping and the preparation of financial reports. Accountants are now capable of working in exciting new growth areas such as: forensic accounting (solving crimes such as computer hacking and the theft of large amounts of money on the internet); e-commerce (designing web-based payment system); financial \nplanning, environm   ental accounting, etc. This \nrealisation came due to the fact that accounting is capable of providing the kind of information that managers and other interested persons need in order to make better decisions.

As an information system, it collects data and communicates economic information about the organisation to a wide variety of users whose decisions and actions are related to its performance. This introductory chapter therefore, deals with the nature, need and scope of accounting in this context.\n1.1 Meaning of Accounting\nIn 1941, The American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) had \ndefined accounting as the art of recording, classifying, and summarising in a significant manner and in terms of money, transactions and events which are, in part at least, of financial character, and interpreting the results thereof’.With greater economic development resulting in changing role of accounting, its scope, became broader. In 1966, the American Accounting Association (AAA) defined accounting as ‘the process of identifying, measuring and communicating economic information to permit informed judgments and decisions by users of information’.\nFig. 1.1 : Showing the process of accounting\nCh01.indd   2 9/29/2022   2:18:54 PM\n2024-25"

In order to appreciate the exact nature of accounting, we must understand the following relevant aspects of the definition:\n• Economic Events\n• Identification, Measurement, Recording and Communication\n• Organisation\n• Interested Users of Information\nBox  1\nHistory and Development of Accounting\nAccounting enjoys a remarkable heritage. The history of accounting is as old as \ncivilisation. The seeds of accounting were most likely first sown in Babylonia and Egypt around 4000 B.C. who recorded transactions of payment of wages and taxes on clay tablets. Historical evidences reveal that Egyptians used some form of accounting for their treasuries where gold and other valuables were kept. The incharge of treasuries had to send day wise reports to their superiors known as Wazirs (the prime minister) and from there month wise reports were sent to kings. Babylonia, known as the city of commerce, used accounting for business to uncover losses taken place due to frauds and lack of efficiency. In Greece, accounting was used for apportioning the revenues received among treasuries, maintaining total receipts, total payments and balance of government financial transactions. Romans used memorandum or daybook where in receipts and payments were recorded and wherefrom they were posted to ledgers on monthly basis. (700 B.C to 400 A.D). China used sophisticated form of government accounting as early as 2000 B.C. Accounting practices in India could be traced back to a period when twenty three centuries ago, Kautilya, a minister in Chandragupta’s kingdom wrote a book named Arthashasthra, which also described how accounting \nrecords had to be maintained.\n       Luca Pacioli’s, a Franciscan friar (merchant class), book Summa de \nArithmetica, Geometria, Proportion at Proportionality  (Review of Arithmetic and Geometric \nproportions) in Venice (1494) is considered as the first book on double entry book-\nkeeping. A portion of this book contains knowledge of business and book-keeping. \nCh01.indd   3 9/29/2022   2:18:54 PM\n2024-25"

It shows that he probably relied on then–current book-keeping manuals as the basis for his masterpiece. In his book, he used the present day popular terms of accounting Debit (Dr.) and Credit (Cr.). These were the concepts used in Italian terminology. Debit comes from the Italian debito which comes from \nthe Latin debita and debeo which means owed to the proprietor. Credit comes from the Italian credito which comes from the Latin ‘credo’ which means trust or belief (in the proprietor or owed by the proprietor. In explaining double entry system, Pacioli wrote that ‘All entries… have to be double entries, that is if you make one creditor, you must make some debtor’. He also stated that a merchants responsibility include to give glory to God in their enterprises, to be ethical in all business activities and to earn a profit. He discussed the details of memorandum, journal, ledger and specialised accounting procedures.\n1.1.1   Economic Events\nBusiness organisations involves economic events. An economic event is known \nas a happening of consequence to a business organisation which consists of  transactions and which are measurable in monetary terms. For example, purchase of machinery, installing and keeping it ready for manufacturing is an event which comprises  number of financial transactions such as buying a machine, transportation of machine, site preparation for installation of a machine, expenditure incurred on its installation and trial runs. Thus, accounting identifies bunch of transactions relating to an economic event. If an event involves transactions between an outsider and an organisation, these are known as \nexternal \tevents . The following are the examples of such transactions:\n• Sale of merchandise to the customers.\n• Rendering services to the customers by ABC Limited.\n• Purchase of materials from suppliers.\n• Payment of monthly rent to the landlord.\nAn\tinternal\tevent\tis an economic event that occurs entirely between the \ninternal wings of an enterprise, e.g., supply of raw material or components by the stores department to the manufacturing department, payment of wages to the employees, etc.\nCh01.indd   4 9/29/2022   2:18:54 PM\n2024-25"

It involves observing activities and selecting \nthose events that are of considered financial character and relate to the organisation. The business transactions and other economic events therefore are evaluated for deciding whether it has to be recorded in books of account.  For example, the value of human resources, changes in managerial policies or appointment of personnel are important but none of these are recorded in  books of account. However, when a company makes a sale or purchase, whether on cash or credit, or pays salary it is recorded in the books of account.\nMeasurement : It means quantification (including estimates) of business \ntransactions into financial terms by using monetary unit, viz. rupees and paise \nas a measuring unit.  If an event cannot be quantified in monetary terms, it is not considered for recording in financial accounts.  That is why important items like the appointment of a new managing director, signing of contracts or changes in personnel are not shown in the books of accounts. \nRecording : Once the economic events are identified and measured in financial \nterms, these are recorded in books of account in monetary terms and in a chronological order. Recording is done in a manner that the necessary financial information is summarised as per well-established practice and is made available as and when required.\nCommunication :  The economic events are identified, measured and recorded \nin order that the pertinent information is generated and communicated in \na certain form to management and other internal and external users.  The information is regularly communicated through  accounting reports. These reports provide information that are useful to a variety of users who have an interest in assessing the financial performance and the position of an enterprise, planning and controlling business activities and making necessary decisions from time to time. The accounting information system should be designed in such a way that the right information is communicated to the right person at the right time. Reports can be daily, weekly, monthly, or quarterly, depending upon the needs of the users.  An important element in the communication process is the accountant’s ability and efficiency in presenting the relevant information.\nCh01.indd   5 9/29/2022   2:18:54 PM\n2024-25"

Depending upon the size of activities and level of business operation, \nit can be a sole-proprietory concern, partnership firm, cooperative society, company, local authority, municipal corporation or any other association of persons.\n1.1.4\t \t Interested \tUsers\tof\tInformation\nAccounting is a means by which necessary financial information about business enterprise is communicated and is also called the language of business. Many users need financial information in order to make important decisions. These users can be divided into two broad categories: internal users and external \nusers.  Internal users include: Chief Executive, Financial Officer, Vice President, \nBusiness Unit Managers, Plant Managers, Store Managers, Line Supervisors, etc. External users include: present and potential Investors (shareholders), Creditors (Banks and other Financial Institutions, Debenture-holders and other Lenders), Tax Authorities, Regulatory Agencies (Department of Company Affairs, Registrar of Companies, Securities Exchange Board of India, Labour Unions, Trade Associations, Stock Exchange and Customers, etc. Since the primary function of accounting is to provide useful information for decision-making, it is a means to an end, with the end being the decision that is helped by the availability of accounting information. You will study about the types of accounting information and its users later in this chapter.\nBox  2\nWhy do the Users Want Accounting Information?\n • The owners/shareholders use them to see if they are getting a satisfactory return \non their investment, and to assess the financial health of their company/business.\n • The directors/managers use them for making both internal and external \ncomparisons in their attempts to evaluate the performance. They may compare the financial analysis of their company with the industry figures in order to ascertain the company’s strengths and weaknesses. Management is also concerned with ensuring that the money invested in the company/organisation is generating an \nCh01.indd   6 9/29/2022   2:18:54 PM\n2024-25"

Every step in the process of accounting generates information. Generation of information is not an end in itself. It is a means to facilitate the dissemination of information among different user groups. Such information enables the interested parties to take appropriate decisions. Therefore, dissemination of information is an essential function of accounting. To be useful, the accounting information should  \nensure to:\n • provide information for making economic decisions;\n • serve the users who rely on financial statements as their principal source \nof information;\n • provide information useful for predicting and evaluating the amount, \ntiming and uncertainty of potential cash-flows;\n • provide information for judging management’s ability to utilise resources \neffectively in meeting goals;\n • provide factual and interpretative informatio n by disclosing underlying \nassumptions on matters subject to interpretation, evaluation, prediction, or estimation; and\n • provide information on activities affecting the society.\nCh01.indd   7 9/29/2022   2:18:54 PM\n2024-25"

Management accounting draws the relevant information mainly from financial accounting and cost accounting which helps the management in budgeting, assessing profitability, taking pricing decisions, capital expenditure decisions and so on. Besides, it generates other information (quantitative and qualitative, financial and non-financial) which relates to the future and is relevant for decision-making in the organisation.  Such information includes: sales forecast, cash flows, purchase requirement, manpower needs, environmental data about effects on air, water, land, natural resources, flora, fauna, human health, social responsibilities, etc.\nAs a result, the scope of accounting has become so vast, that new areas \nlike human resource accounting, social accounting, responsibility accounting have also gained prominance.\nLet’s Do It\nMany People in today’s society think of an accountant as simply a glorified book-keeper. \nBut the role of an accountant is continually changing.

In order to assess whether accounting information is decision useful, it must possess the characteristics of reliability, relevance, understandability and comparability.\nReliability\nReliability means the users must be able to depend on the information. \nThe reliability of accounting information is determined by the degree of correspondence between what the information conveys about the transactions or events that have occurred, measured and displayed.  A reliable information should be free from error and bias and faithfully represents what it is meant to represent.  To ensure reliability, the information disclosed must be credible, verifiable by independent parties use the same method of measuring, and be neutral and faithful (refer figure 1.3).\nCh01.indd   9 9/29/2022   2:18:54 PM\n2024-25"

These are briefly explained below :\nFinancial accounting : The purpose of this branch of accounting is to keep a record \nof all financial transactions so that:\n(a) the profit earned or loss sustained by the business during an accounting period  \n can be worked out,\n(b) the financial position of the business as at the end of the accounting period  \n can be ascertained, and\n(c) the financial information required by the management and other interested  \n parties can be provided.\nCost Accounting : The purpose of cost accounting is to analyse the expenditure so as to ascertain the cost of various products manufactured by the firm and fix the prices.

The necessary information, particularly in case of external users, is provided in the form of financial statements, viz., profit and loss account and balance sheet. Besides these, the management is provided with additional information from time to time from the accounting records of business. Thus, the primary objectives of accounting include the following:\n1.3.1\t \t Maintenance \tof\tRecords \tof\tBusiness \tTransactions\nAccounting  is used for the maintenance of a systematic record of all financial transactions in book of accounts. Even the most brilliant executive or manager cannot accurately remember the numerous amount of varied transactions such as purchases, sales, receipts, payments, etc. that takes place in business everyday. Hence, a proper and complete records of all business transactions are kept regularly. Moreover, the recorded information enables verifiability and acts as an evidence.\n1.3.2\t \t Calculation \tof\tProfit\tand\tLoss\nThe owners of business are keen to have an idea about the net results of their business operations periodically, i.e. whether the business has earned profits or incurred losses. Thus, another objective of accounting is to ascertain the profit \nCh01.indd   12 9/29/2022   2:18:54 PM\n2024-25"

Profit represents excess of revenue (income), over expenses. If the total revenue of a given period is ` 6,00,000 and total expenses are ` 5,40,000 the profit will be equal to  \n` 60,000(` 6,00,000 – ` 5,40,000). If however, the total expenses exceed the total revenue, the difference reflects the loss.\n1.3.3\t \t Depiction \tof\tFinancial \tPosition\nAccounting also aims at ascertaining the financial position of the business concern in the form of its assets and liabilities at the end of every accounting period. A proper record of resources owned by business organisation (Assets) and claims against such resources (Liabilities) facilitates the preparation of a statement known as balance sheet position statement.\n1.3.4\t \t Providing \tAccounting \tInformation \tto\tits\tUsers\nThe acco unting information generated by the accounting process is \ncommunicated in the form of reports, statements, graphs and charts to the users who need it in different decision situations. As already stated, there are two main user groups, viz. internal users, mainly management, who needs \ntimely information on cost of sales, profitability, etc. for planning, controlling and decision-making and external users  who have limited authority, ability and \nresources to obtain the necessary information and have to rely on financial statements (Balance Sheet, Profit and Loss account). Primarily, the external users are interested in the following:\n• Investors and potential investors-information on the risks and return on \ninvestment;\n• Unions and employee grou ps-information on the stability, profitability and \ndistribution of wealth within the business;\n• Lenders and financial institutions-information on the creditworthiness of \nthe company and its ability to repay loans and pay interest;\n• Suppliers and creditors-information on whether amounts owed will be \nrepaid when due, and on the continued existence of the business;\n• Customers-information on the continued existence of the business and \nthus the probability of a continued supply of products, parts and after sales service;\nCh01.indd   13 9/29/2022   2:18:54 PM\n2024-25"

It describes and analyses a mass of data of an enterprise through measurement, classification and summarisation, and reduces those date into reports and statements, which show the financial condition and results of operations of that enterprise. Hence, it is regarded as a language of business. It also performs the service activity by providing quantitative financial information that helps the users in various ways. Accounting as an information system collects and communicates economic information about an enterprise to a wide variety of interested parties. However, accounting information relates to the past transactions and is quantitative and financial in nature, it does not provide qualitative and non-financial information. These limitations of accounting must be kept in view while making use of the accounting information.\nCh01.indd   14 9/29/2022   2:18:54 PM\n2024-25"

Business entity \nmeans a specifically identifiable business enterprise like Super Bazaar, Hire Jewellers, ITC Limited, etc. An accounting system is always devised for a specific \nbusiness entity (also called accounting entity).\n1.5.2\t \t Transaction\nAn event involving some value between two or more entities. It can be a purchase \nof goods, receipt of money, payment to a creditor, incurring expenses, etc. It can be a cash transaction or a credit transaction.\n1.5.3  \t Assets\nAssets are economic resources of an enterprise that can be usefully expressed in monetary terms. Assets are items of value used by the business in its operations. For example, Super Bazar owns a fleet of trucks, which is used by it for delivering foodstuffs; the trucks, thus, provide economic benefit to the enterprise. This item will be shown on the asset side of the balance sheet of Super Bazaar. Assets can be broadly classified into two types: current and  \nNon-current (Figure 1.4).\nCh01.indd   16 9/29/2022   2:18:54 PM\n2024-25"

They represent creditors’ claims on the firm’s assets. Both small and big businesses find it necessary to borrow money at one time or the other, and to purchase goods on credit. Super Bazar, for example, purchases goods for  \n` 10,000 on credit for a month from Fast Food Products on March 25, 2005. If the balance sheet of Super Bazaar is prepared as at March 31, 2005, Fast Food Products will be shown as creditors on the liabilities side of the balance sheet. If Super Bazaar takes a loan for a period of three years from Delhi State Co-operative Bank, this will also be shown as a liability in the balance sheet of Super Bazaar.

Other items of revenue common to many businesses are: commission, interest, dividends, royalities, rent received, etc. Revenue is also called income.\n1.5.8   Expenses\nCosts incurred by a business in the process of earning revenue are known as expenses. Generally, expenses are measured by the cost of assets consumed or services used during an accounting period. The usual items of expenses are: depreciation, rent, wages, salaries, interest, cost of heater, light and water, telephone, etc.\n1.5.9\t \t Expenditure\nSpending money or incurring a liability for some benefit, service or property \nreceived is called expenditure. Purchase of goods, purchase of machinery, purchase of furniture, etc. are examples of expenditure. If the benefit of expenditure is exhausted within a year, it is treated as an expense (also called revenue expenditure). On the other hand, the benefit of an expenditure lasts for more than a year, it is treated as an asset (also called capital expenditure) such as purchase of machinery, furniture, etc.\n1.5.10\t\tProfit\nThe excess of revenues of a period over its related expenses during an accounting year is profit.

It is offered in two \nways. Offering deduction of agreed percentage of list price at the time selling goods is one way of giving discount. Such discount is called ‘trade discount’. It is generally offered by manufactures to wholesellers and by wholesellers to retailers. After selling the goods on credit basis the debtors may be given certain deduction in amount due in case if they pay the amount within the stipulated period or earlier. This deduction is given at the time of payment on the amount payable. Hence, it is called as cash discount. Cash discount acts as an incentive that encourages prompt payment by the debtors.\n1.5.14\t\tVoucher\nThe documentary evidence in support of a transaction is known as voucher. For example, if we buy goods for cash, we get cash memo, if we buy on credit, we get an invoice; when we make a payment we get a receipt and so on.\n1.5.15   Goods\nIt refers to the products in which the business unit is dealing, i.e. in terms of which it is buying and selling or producting and selling. The items that are purchased for use in the business are not called goods.

It aims at providing information about the financial performance of a firm to its various users such as owners, managers employees, investors, creditors, suppliers of goods and services and tax authorities and help them in taking important decisions. The investors, for example, may be interested in knowing the extent of profit or loss earned by the firm during a given period and compare it with the performance of other similar enterprises. The suppliers of credit, say a banker, may, in addition, be interested in liquidity position of the enterprise. All these people look forward to accounting for appropriate, useful and reliable information.\nFor making the accounting information \nmeaningful to its internal and external users, it is important that such information is reliable as well \nas comparable . The comparability of information \nis required both to make inter-firm  comparisons, \ni.e. to see how a firm has performed as compared to the other firms, as well as to make inter-period \ncomparison, i.e. how it has performed as compared to the previous years. This becomes possible only if the information provided by the financial statements is based on consistent accounting policies, principles and practices. Such consistency is required throughout the process of identifying the Theory Base of Accounting 2\nCh02.indd   25 9/29/2022   4:40:30 PM\n2024-25"

This calls for developing a proper theory base of accounting.\nThe importance of accounting theory  need not be over-emphasised as no \ndiscipline can develop without a sound theoretical base. The theory base of accounting consists of principles, concepts, rules and guidelines developed over a period of time to bring uniformity and consistency to the process of accounting and enhance its utility to different users of accounting information. Apart from these, the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India, (ICAI), which is the regulatory body for standardisation of accounting policies in the country has issued Accounting Standards which are expected to be uniformly adhered to, in order to bring consistency in the accounting practices. These are discussed in the sections to follow.\n2.1 Generally Accepted Accounting Principles\nIn order to maintain uniformity and consistency in accounting records, certain rules or principles have been developed which are generally accepted by the accounting profession. These rules are called by different names such as principles, concepts, conventions, postulates, assumptions and modifying principles.\nThe term ‘principle’ has been defined by AICPA as ‘A general law or rule \nadopted or professed as a guide to action, a settled ground or basis of conduct or practice’. The word ‘generally’ means ‘in a general manner’, i.e., pertaining to many persons or cases or occasions. Thus, Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) refers to the rules or guidelines adopted for recording and reporting of business transactions, in order to bring uniformity in the preparation and the presentation of financial statements. For example, one of the important rule is to record all transactions on the basis of historical cost, which is verifiable from the documents such as cash receipt for the money paid. This brings in objectivity in the process of recording and makes the accounting statements more acceptable to various users.\nThe Generally Accepted Accounting Principles have evolved over a long \nperiod of time on the basis of past experiences, usages or customs, statements by individuals and professional bodies and regulations by government agencies and have general acceptability among most accounting professionals. However, the principles of accounting are not static in nature. These are constantly influenced by changes in the legal, social and economic environment as well as the needs of the users.\nThese principles are also referred as concepts and conventions. The term \nconcept refers to the necessary assumptions and ideas which are fundamental \nCh02.indd   26 9/29/2022   4:40:30 PM\n2024-25"

In practice, the same \nrules or guidelines have been described by one author as a concept, by another as a postulate and still by another as convention. This at times becomes confusing to the learners. Instead of going into the semantics of these terms, it is important to concentrate on the practicability of their usage. From the practicability view point, it is observed that the various terms such as principles, postulates, conventions, modifying principles, assumptions, etc. have been used inter-changeably and are referred to as Basic Accounting Concepts in the present chapter. \n2.2 Basic Accounting Concepts\nThe basic accounting concepts are referred to as the fundamental ideas or basic assumptions underlying the theory and practice of financial accounting and are broad working rules for all accounting activities and developed by the accounting profession. The important concepts have been listed as below:\n • Business entity;\n • Money measurement;\n • Going concern;\n • Accounting period;\n • Cost\n • Dual aspect (or Duality);\n • Revenue recognition (Real isation); • Matching;\n • Full disclosure;\n • Consistency;\n • Conservatism (Prudence);\n • Materiality;\n • Objectivity.\n2.2.1   Business Entity Concept\nThe concept of business entity assumes that business has a distinct and \nseparate entity from its owners. It means that for the purposes of accounting, \nthe business and its owners are to be treated as two separate entities. Keeping this in view, when a person brings in some money as capital into his business, in accounting records, it is treated as liability of the business to the owner. Here, one separate entity (owner) is assumed to be giving money to another distinct \nentity (business unit). Similarly, when the owner withdraws any money from the \nbusiness for his personal expenses(drawings), it is treated as reduction of the owner’s capital and consequently a reduction in the liabilities of the business. \nThe accounting records are made in the book of accounts from the point of view \nof the business unit and not that of the owner. The personal assets and liabilities of the owner are, therefore, not considered while recording and reporting the assets and liabilities of the business. Similarly, personal transactions of the owner are not recorded in the books of the business, unless it involves inflow or outflow of business funds.\nCh02.indd   27 9/29/2022   4:40:30 PM\n2024-25"

                "text": "28\nAccountancy\n2.2.2   Money Measurement Concept\nThe concept of money measurement states that only those transactions and \nhappenings in an organisation which can be expressed in terms of money such as sale of goods or payment of expenses or receipt of income, etc., are to be recorded in the book of accounts. All such transactions or happenings which can not be expressed in monetary terms, for example, the appointment of a manager, capabilities of its human resources or creativity of its research department or image of the organisation among people in general do not find a place in the accounting records of a firm.\nAnother important aspect of the concept of money measurement is that the \nrecords of the transactions are to be kept not in the physical units but in the monetary unit. For example, an organisation may, on a particular day, have a factory on a piece of land measuring 2 acres, office building containing 10 rooms, 30 personal computers, 30 office chairs and tables, a bank balance of `5 lakh, raw material weighing 20-tons, and 100 cartons of finished goods. These assets are expressed in different units, so can not be added to give any meaningful information about the total worth of business. For accounting purposes, therefore, these are shown in money terms and recorded in rupees and paise. In this case, the cost of factory land may be say ` 2 crore; office \nbuilding ` 1 crore; computers `15 lakh; office chairs and tables ` 2 lakh; raw \nmaterial ` 33 lakh and finished goods ` 4 lakh. Thus, the total assets of the \nenterprise are valued at ` 3 crore and 59 lakh. Similarly, all transactions are recorded in rupees and paise as and when they take place.\nThe money measurement assumption is not free from limitations. Due to the \nchanges in prices, the value of money does not remain the same over a period of time. The value of rupee today on account of rise in prices is much less than what it was, say ten years back. Therefore, in the balance sheet, when we add different assets bought at different points of time, say building purchased in 1995 for ` 2 crore, and plant purchased in 2005 for ` 1 crore, we are in fact \nadding heterogeneous values, which can not be clubbed together. As the change in the value of money is not reflected in the book of accounts, the accounting data does not reflect the true and fair view of the affairs of an enterprise.\n2.2.3   Going Concern Concept\nThe concept of going concern assumes that a business firm would continue to carry out its operations indefinitely, i.e. for a fairly long period of time and would not be liquidated in the foreseeable future. This is an important assumption of accounting as it provides the very basis for showing the value of assets in the balance sheet. \nCh02.indd   28 9/29/2022   4:40:30 PM\n2024-25"

When we purchase an asset, \nfor example, a personal computer, for a sum of ` 50,000, what we are buying \nreally is the services of the computer that we shall be getting over its estimated life span, say 5 years. It will not be fair to charge the whole amount of ` 50,000, \nfrom the revenue of the year in which the asset is purchased. Instead, that part of the asset which has been consumed or used during a period should be charged from the revenue of that period. The assumption regarding continuity of business allows us to charge from the revenues of a period only that part of the asset which has been consumed or used to earn that revenue in that period and carry forward the remaining amount to the next years, over the estimated life of the asset. Thus, we may charge ` 10,000 every year for 5 years from the \nprofit and loss account. In case the continuity assumption is not there, the whole cost ( ` 50,000 in the present example) will need to be charged from the \nrevenue of the year in which the asset was purchased. \n2.2.4   Accounting Period Concept\nAccounting period refers to the span of time at the end of which the financial \nstatements of an enterprise are prepared, to know whether it has earned profits or incurred losses during that period and what exactly is the position of its assets and liabilities at the end of that period. Such information is required by different users at regular interval for various purposes, as no firm can wait for long to know its financial results as various decisions are to be taken at regular intervals on the basis of such information. The financial statements are, therefore, prepared at regular interval, normally after a period of one year, so that timely information is made available to the users. This interval of time is called accounting period. \nThe Companies Act 2013 and the Income Tax Act require that the income \nstatements should be prepared annually. However, in case of certain situations,  \npreparation of interim financial statements become necessary. For example, at \nthe time of retirement of a partner, the accounting period can be different from twelve months period. Apart from these companies whose shares are listed on the stock exchange, are required to publish quarterly results to ascertain the profitability and financial position at the end of every three months period.\nTest Your Understanding - I\nChoose the Correct Answer\n1.

To illustrate, on June 2005, an old plant was purchased for ` 50 lakh by Shiva Enterprise,  which \nis into the business of manufacturing detergent powder. An amount of  \n` 10,000 was spent on transporting the plant to the factory site. In addition, \n`\n 15,000 was spent on repairs for bringing the plant into running position \nand ` 25,000 on its installation. The total amount at which the plant will \nbe recorded in the books of account would be the sum of all these, i.e.  \n` 50,50,000.\nThe concept of cost is historical in nature as it is something, which has \nbeen paid on the date of acquisition and does not change year after year. \nFor example, if a building has been purchased by a firm for ` 2.5 crore, the \npurchase price will remain the same for all years to come, though its market value may change. Adoption of historical cost brings in objectivity in recording as the cost of acquisition is easily verifiable from the purchase documents. The market value basis, on the other hand, is not reliable as the value of an asset may change from time to time, making the comparisons between one period to another rather difficult. \nHowever, an important limitation of the historical cost basis is that it does \nnot show the true worth of the business and may lead to hidden profits. During the period of rising prices, the market value or the cost at (which the assets can \nCh02.indd   30 9/29/2022   4:40:30 PM\n2024-25"

It provides the \nvery basis for recording business transactions into the book of accounts. This concept states that every transaction has a dual or two-fold effect and should therefore be recorded at two places. In other words, at least two accounts will be involved in recording a transaction. This can be explained with the help of an example. Ram started business by investing in a sum of ` 50,00,000. The \namount of money brought in by Ram will result in an increase in the assets (cash) of business by ` 50,00,000. At the same time, the owner’s equity or capital \nwill also increase by an equal amount. It may be seen that the two items that got affected by this transaction are cash and capital account. \nLet us take another example to understand this point further. Suppose the \nfirm purchase goods worth ` 10,00,000 on cash. This will increase an asset \n(stock of goods) on the one hand and reduce another asset (cash) on the other. Similarly, if the firm purchases a machine worth ` 30,00,000 on credit from \nReliable Industries. This will increase an asset (machinery) on the one hand and a liability (creditor) on the other. This type of dual effect takes place in case of all business transactions and is also known as duality principle.\nThe duality principle is commonly expressed in terms of fundamental \nAccounting Equation, which is as follows :\nAssets = Liabilities + Capital\nIn other words, the equation states that the assets of a business are \nalways equal to the claims of owners and the outsiders. The claims also called \nequity of owners is termed as Capital(owners’ equity)  and that of outsiders, as \nLiabilities(creditors equity). The two-fold effect of each transaction affects in such a manner that the equality of both sides of equation is maintained.\nThe two-fold effect in respect of all transactions must be duly recorded \nin the book of accounts of the business. In fact, this concept forms the core of \nDouble\tEntry\tSystem  of accounting, which has been dealt in detail, in  \nchapter 3.\n2.2.7   Revenue Recognition (Realisation) Concept\nThe concept of revenue recognition requires that the revenue for a business \ntransaction should be included in the accounting records only when it is realised. Here arises two questions in mind. First, is termed as revenue and \nthe other, when the revenue is realised. Let us take the first one first.  Revenue \nis the gross inflow of cash arising from (i) the sale of goods and services by an \nCh02.indd   31 9/29/2022   4:40:30 PM\n2024-25"

                "text": "32\nAccountancy\nenterprise; and (ii) use by others of the enterprise’s resources yielding interest, \nroyalties and dividends. Secondly, revenue is assumed to be realised when a legal right to receive it arises, i.e. the point of time when goods have been sold or service has been rendered. Thus, credit sales are treated as revenue on the day sales are made and not when money is received from the buyer. As for the income such as rent, commission, interest, etc. these are recongnised on a time basis. For example, rent for the month of March 2017, even if received in April 2017, will be taken into the profit and loss account of the financial year ending March 31, 2017 and not into financial year beginning with April 2017. Similarly, if interest for April 2017 is received in advance in March 2017, it will be taken to the profit and loss account of the financial year ending  \nMarch 2018.\nThere are some exceptions to this general rule of revenue recognition. In \ncase of contracts like construction work, which take long time, say 2-3 years to complete, proportionate amount of revenue, based on the part of contract completed by the end of the period is treated as realised. Similarly, when goods are sold on hire purchase, the amount collected in installments is treated as realised. \n2.2.8   Matching Concept\nThe process of ascertaining the amount of profit earned or the loss incurred \nduring a particular period involves deduction of related expenses from the revenue earned during that period. The matching concept emphasises exactly on this aspect. It states that expenses incurred in an accounting period should be matched with revenues during that period. It follows from this that the revenue and expenses incurred to earn these revenues must belong to the same accounting period.\nAs already stated, revenue is recognised when a sale is complete or service \nis rendered rather when cash is received. Similarly, an expense is recognised not when cash is paid but when an asset or service has been used to generate revenue. For example, expenses such as salaries, rent, insurance are recognised on the basis of period to which they relate and not when these are paid. Similarly, c osts like depreciation of fixed asset is divided over the periods during \nwhich the asset is used.\nLet us also understand how cost of goods are matched with their sales \nrevenue. While ascertaining the profit or loss of an accounting year, we should \nnot take the cost of all the goods produced or purchased during that period but consider only the cost of goods that have been sold during that year. For \nthis purpose, the cost of unsold goods should be deducted from the cost of the \nCh02.indd   32 9/29/2022   4:40:30 PM\n2024-25"

You will learn about this aspect in detail in the \nchapter on financial statement.\nThe matching concept, thus, implies that all revenues earned during \nan accounting year, whether received during that year, or not and all costs incurred, whether paid during the year, or not should be taken into account while ascertaining profit or loss for that year.\n2.2.9   Full Disclosure Concept\nInformation provided by financial statements are used by different groups of people such as investors, lenders, suppliers and others in taking various financial decisions. In the corporate form of organisation, there is a distinction between those managing the affairs of the enterprise and those owning it. Financial statements, however, are the only or basic means of communicating financial information to all interested parties. It becomes all the more important, therefore, that the financial statements makes a full, fair and adequate disclosure of all information which is relevant for taking financial decisions.\nThe principle of full disclosure requires that all material and relevant facts \nconcerning financial performance of an enterprise must be fully and completely \ndisclosed in the financial statements and their accompanying footnotes. This is to enable the users to make correct assessment about the profitability and financial soundness of the enterprise and help them to take informed decisions.\nTo ensure proper disclosure of material accounting information, the Indian \nCompanies Act 1956 has provided a format for the preparation of profit and loss account and balance sheet of a company, which needs to be compulsorily adhered to, for the preparation of these statements. The regulatory bodies like SEBI, also mandates complete disclosures to be made by the companies, to give a true and fair view of profitability and the state of affairs.\n2.2.10  Consistency Concept\nThe accounting information provided by the financial statements would be \nuseful in drawing conclusions regarding the working of an enterprise only when it allows comparisons over a period of time as well as with the working of other enterprises. Thus, both inter-firm and inter-period comparisons are required to be made.  This can be possible only when accounting policies and practices followed by enterprises are uniform and are consistent over the period of time. \nTo illustrate, an investor wants to know the financial performance of an \nenterprise in the current year as compared to that in the previous year. He may compare this year’s net profit with that in the last year. But, if the accounting policies adopted, say with respect to depreciation in the two years are different, the profit figures will not be comparable. Because the method adopted for the \nCh02.indd   33 9/29/2022   4:40:30 PM\n2024-25"

                "text": "34\nAccountancy\nvaluation of stock in the past two years is inconsistent. It is, therefore, important \nthat the concept of consistency is followed in preparation of financial statements so that the results of two accounting periods are comparable. Consistency eliminates personal bias and helps in achieving results that are comparable. \nAlso the comparison between the financial results of two enterprises would \nbe meaningful only if same kind of accounting methods and policies are adopted in the preparation of financial statements.\nHowever, consistency does not prohibit change in accounting policies. \nNecessary required changes are fully disclosed by presenting them in the financial statements indicating their probable effects on the financial results of business.\n2.2.11 Conservatism Concept\nThe concept of conservatism (also called ‘prudence’) provides guidance for \nrecording transactions in the book of accounts and is based on the policy of playing safe. The concept states that a conscious approach should be adopted in ascertaining income so that profits of the enterprise are not overstated. If the profits ascertained are more than the actual, it may lead to distribution of dividend out of capital, which is not fair as it will lead to reduction in the capital of the enterprise.\nThe concept of conservatism requires that profits should not to be recorded \nuntil realised but all losses, even those which may have a remote possibility, are to be provided for in the books of account. To illustrate, valuing closing stock at cost or market value whichever is lower; creating provision for doubtful debts, discount on debtors; writing of intangible assets like goodwill, patents, etc. from the book of accounts are some of the examples of the application of the principle of conservatism. Thus, if market value of the goods purchased has fallen down, the stock will be shown at cost price in the books but if the market value has gone up, the gain is not to be recorded until the stock is sold. This approach of providing for the losses but not recognising the gains until realised is called conservatism approach. This may be reflecting a generally pessimist attitude adopted by the accountants but is an important way of dealing with uncertainty and protecting the interests of creditors against an unwanted distribution of firm’s assets. However, deliberate attempt to underestimate the value of assets should be discouraged as it will lead to hidden profits, called secret reserves.\n2.2.12   Materiality Concept\nThe concept of materiality requires that accounting should focus on material facts. Efforts should not be wasted in recording and presenting facts, which are immaterial in the determination of income. The question that arises here is what is a material fact. The materiality of a fact depends on its nature and the \nCh02.indd   34 9/29/2022   4:40:30 PM\n2024-25"

                "text": "35 \nTheory Base of Accounting\namount involved. Any fact would be considered as material if it is reasonably \nbelieved that its knowledge would influence the decision of informed user of financial statements. For example, money spent on creation of additional capacity of a theatre would be a material fact as it is going to increase the future earning capacity of the enterprise. Similarly, information about any change in the method of depreciation adopted or any liability which is likely to arise in the near future would be significant information. All such information about material facts should be disclosed through the financial statements and the accompanying notes so that users can take informed decisions. In certain cases, when the amount involved is very small, strict adherence to accounting principles is not required. For example, stock of erasers, pencils, scales, etc. are not shown as assets, whatever amount of stationery is  bought in an accounting period is treated as the expense of that period, whether consumed or not. The amount spent is treated as revenue expenditure and taken to the profit and loss account of the year in which the expenditure is incurred.\n2.2.13  Objectivity Concept\nThe concept of objectivity requires that accounting transaction should be \nrecorded in an objective manner, free from the bias of accountants and others. This can be possible when each of the transaction is supported by verifiable documents or vouchers. For example, the transaction for the purchase of materials may be supported by the cash receipt for the money paid, if the same is purchased on cash or copy of invoice and delivery challan, if the same is purchased on credit. Similarly, receipt for the amount paid for purchase of a machine becomes the documentary evidence for the cost of machine and provides an objective basis for verifying this transaction. One of the reasons for the  adoption of ‘Historical Cost’ as the basis of recording accounting transaction is that adherence to the principle of objectivity is made possible by it. As stated above, the cost actually paid for an asset can be verified from the documents but it is very difficult to ascertain the market value of an asset until it is actually sold. Not only that, the market value may vary from person to person and from place to place, and so ‘objectivity’ cannot be maintained if such value is adopted for accounting purposes.\nTest Your Understanding - II\nFill in the correct word:\n1.

The_______________concept requires that accounting transaction should be free \nfrom the bias of accountants and others.\n2.3 Systems of Accounting\nThe systems of recording transactions in the book of accounts are generally \nclassified  into two types, viz. Double entry system and Single entry system. Double entry system is based on the principle of  “Dual Aspect” which states that every transaction has two effects, viz. receiving of a benefit and giving of a benefit. Each transaction, therefore, involves two or more accounts and is recorded at different places in the ledger. The basic principle followed is that every debit must have a corresponding credit. Thus, one account is debited and the other is credited.\nDouble entry system is a complete system as both the aspects of a \ntransaction are recorded in the book of accounts. The system is accurate and  \nmore reliable as the possibilities of frauds and mis-appropriations are minimised. The arithmetic inaccuracies in records can mostly be checked by preparing the trial balance. The system of double entry can be implemented by big as well as small organisations.\nSingle entry system is not a complete system of maintaining records of \nfinancial transactions. It does not record two-fold effect of each and every transaction. Instead of maintaining all the accounts, only personal accounts and cash book are maintained under this system. In fact, this is not a system but a lack of system as no uniformity is maintained in the recording of transactions. For some transactions, only one aspect is recorded, for others, both the aspects are recorded. The accounts maintained under this system are incomplete and unsystematic and therefore, not reliable. The system is, however, followed by small business firms as it is very simple and flexible (you will study about them in detail later in this book).\n2.4 Basis of Accounting\nFrom the point of view the timing of recognition of revenue and costs, there can be two broad approaches to accounting. These are:\n(i) Cash basis; and \n(ii) Accrual basis.\nUnder the cash basis , entries in the book of accounts are made when cash is \nreceived or paid and not when the receipt or payment becomes due. Let us say, \nCh02.indd   36 9/29/2022   4:40:30 PM\n2024-25"

                "text": "37 \nTheory Base of Accounting\nfor example, if office rent for the month of December 2014, is paid in January \n2015, it would be recorded in the book of account only in January 2015.\nSimilarly sale of goods on credit in the month of January 2015 would not \nbe recorded in January but say in April, when the payment for the same is received. Thus this system is incompatible with the matching principle, which states that the revenue of a period is matched with the cost of the same period. Though simple, this method is inappropriate for most organisations as profit is calculated as a difference between the receipts and disbursement of money for the given period rather than on happening of the transactions.\nUnder the accrual basis, however, revenues and costs are recognised in the \nperiod in which they occur rather when they are paid. A distinction is made between the receipt of cash and the right to receive cash and payment of cash and legal obligation to pay cash. Thus, under this system, the monitory effect of a transaction is taken into account in the period in which they are earned rather than in the period in which cash is actually received or paid by the enterprise. This is a more appropriate basis for the calculation of profits as expenses are matched against revenue earned in relation thereto. For example, raw material consumed are matched against the cost of goods sold.\n2.5 Accounting Standards\nAccounting standards are written policy documents covering the aspects of recognition, measurement, treatment, presentation and disclosure of accounting transactions in financial statements. Accounting standard is an authoritative statement issued by ICAI, a professional body of accounting in our country. The objective of accounting standard is to bring uniformity in different accounting policies in order to eliminate non comparability of financial statements for enhancing reliability of financial statements. Secondly, the accounting standard provides a set of standard accounting policies, valuation norms and disclosure requirements. In addition to improving credibility of accounting data, accounting standard enhances comparability of financial statements, both intra and inter enterprises. Such comparisons are very effective and widely used for assessment of firms’ performance by the users of accounting.\nNeed for Accounting Standards\nAccounting extends information to various users of information. Accounting \ninformation can serve the interest of different users only if it possesses uniformity and full disclosure of relevant information. There can be alternate accounting treatment and valuation norms which may be used by any business entity. Accounting standard facilitate the scope of those alternatives which fulfil the basic qualitative characteristics of true and fair financial statement.\nCh02.indd   37 9/29/2022   4:40:30 PM\n2024-25"

Accounting standard may call for disclosures of certain information \nwhich may not be required by law, but such information might be useful \nfor general public, investors and creditors.\n3. Accounting standard facilitate comparability between financial \nstatements of inter and intra companies.\nLimitations of Accounting Standards\n1. Accounting standar d makes choice between different alternate \naccounting treatments difficult to apply.\n2. It is rigidly followed and fails to extend flexibility in applying accounting \nstandards.\n3. Accounting standard cannot override the statue. The standards are \nrequired to be farmed within the ambit of prevailing status.\nGoods and Services Tax\n(One Country One Tex)\nGST is a destination based tax on consumption of goods and services. It is proposed to be levied at all stages right from manufacture up to final consumption with credit of taxes paid at previous stages available as setoff.  In a nutshell, only value addition will be taxed and burden of tax is to be borne by the final consumer. The concept of destination based tax on consumption implies has the tax would accrue to the taxing authority which has jurisdiction over the place of consumption which is also termed as place of supply. \nGST has a dual aspect with the Centre and States simultaneously levying \non a common tax base. There are three main components of GST which are CGST, SGST, CGST means Central Goods and Services Tax. Taxes collected under CGST will constitute the revenues of the Central Government . The present central taxes like central excise duty, additional  excise duty, special excise duty, central sales tax etc., will be subsumed under CGST. SGST means State Good and Services Tax. A collection of SGST is the revenue of the State Government. With GST all state taxes like VAT, entertainment tax, luxury tax, entry tax etc, will be merged with GST. For example, Ramesh a dealer in Punjab sell goods to Seema in Punjab worth ` 10,000. If the GST rate is 18%, i.e., 9% \nCGST and 9% SGST, ` 900 will go to Central Government and 900 will go to \nPunjab Government. \nIGST means Integrated Goods and Services Tax. Revenue collected under \nIGST is divided between Central and State Government as per the rates specified \nCh02.indd   38 9/29/2022   4:40:30 PM\n2024-25"

Import of goods and services are also covered under IGST. For \nexample, if the goods are transferred from Madhya Pradesh to Rajasthan then this transaction will attract IGST. Lets extend the above example to understand SGST. If Ramesh in Madhya Pradesh sell goods to Anand in Rajasthan worth  \n` 1,000,000. Applicable GST late is 18% i.e., 9% CGST and 9% SGST. In this case, the dealer will charge 18,000 as IGST and will go the Central Government.\nIndia is a federal country where both the Centre and the States have been assigned the powers to levy and collect taxes through appropriate legislation. Both the levels of government have distinct responsibilities to perform according to the division of powers prescribed in the Constitution for which they need to rise resources. A dual GST will, therefore, be in keeping with the Constitutional requirement of fiscal federalism. Hence, Centre will levy and administer CGST & IGST while respective states will levy and administer SGST. The Constitution of India has been \namended for this purpose. \nCh02.indd   39 9/29/2022   4:40:30 PM\n2024-25"

There is no multiple levy of tax on goods and services, such as sales \ntax, entry tax, octroi, entertainment tax or luxury tax etc.\nDo it yourself\nState how the GST rates will be applicable if CGST is 9%, SGST is 9% and \nIGST 18% in each of the following situations:\n1. Goods worth ` 10,000 is sold by a Manufacturer 1 in Maharashtra to \na Dealer A in Maharastra.\n2. Dealer A sell goods worth ` 25,000 to Dealer B in Gujarat.\n3. Dealer B sell goods to Sunita in Gujarat worth ` 30,000.\n4. Sunita sell goods to Ravindra in Rajasthan worth ` 65,000.\nAdvantages\n1. Introduction of GST has resulted in the abolition of multiple types of \ntaxes in goods and services. \n2. GST widens the tax base and increased revenue to Centre and State \nthereby reducing administrative cost for the Government.\n3. GST has reduced compliance cost and increases voluntary compliance. \n4. GST has affected rates of tax to the maximum of two floor rates. \n5. GST has removed the cascading effect on taxation. \n6. GST will result in enhancing manufacturing and distribution system \naffecting the cost of production of goods and services and consequently \nthe demand and production of goods and services will increase. \n7. It will eventually promote economic efficiency and sustainable long term \neconomic growth as GST is neutral to business processes, business models, organisational structure and geographical location.\n8. GST would help to extend competitive edge in international market for \ngoods and services produced in the country leading to increased exports.GST\nIntra-State\nMovementInter-State\nMovement\nCGST SGSTIGST\nGST levied by the\nCentreGST levied by the\nStateGST levied by the Centre\nand States Concurrently\nCh02.indd   41 9/29/2022   4:40:30 PM\n2024-25"

Also, the records of the transactions are to be kept not in the physical units but in the monetary units.\n 5. Going Concern : The concept of going concern assumes that a business firm would \ncontinue to carry out its operations indefinitely (for a fairly long period of time) and would not be liquidated in the near future.\n 6. Accounting Period : Accounting period refers to the span of time at the end of which the \nfinancial statements of an enterprise are prepared to know whether it has earned profits or incurred losses during that period and what exactly is the position of its assets and liabilities, at the end of that period.\n 7. Cost Concept : The cost concept requires that all assets are recorded in the book \nof accounts at their cost price, which includes cost of acquisition, transportation, installation and making the asset ready for the use.\n 8. Dual Aspect : This concept states that every transaction has a dual or two-fold effect on \nvarious accounts and should therefore be recorded at two places. The duality principle is commonly expressed in terms of fundamental accounting equation, which is:\n Assets  =  Liabilities + Capital\n 9. Revenue Recognition : Revenue is the gross in-flow of cash arising from the sale of goods \nand services by an enterprise and use by others of the enterprise resources yielding interest royalities and divididends. The concept of revenue recognition requires that the revenue for a business transaction should be considered realised when a legal right to receive it arises.\n 10. Matching : The concept of matching emphasises that expenses incurred  in an accounting \nperiod should be matched with revenues during that period. It follows from this that the revenue and expenses incurred to earn these revenue must belong to the same accounting period.\n 11. Full Disclosure : This concept requires that all material and relevant  facts concerning \nfinancial performance of an enterprise must be fully and completely disclosed in the financial statements and their accompanying  footnotes.\n 12. Consistency : This concepts states that accounting policies and practices followed by \nenterprises should be uniform and consistent one the period of time so that results are composable. Comparability results when the same accounting principles are consistently being applied by different enterprises for the period under comparison, or the same firm for a number of periods.\n13.\t Conservatism: This concept requires that business transactions should be recorded in \nsuch a manner that profits are not overstated. All anticipated losses should be accounted for but all unrealised gains should be ignored.\n14.\n Materiality : This concept states that accounting should focus on material facts. If the \nitem is likely to influence the decision of a reasonably prudent investor or creditor, it should be regarded as material, and shown in the financial statements.\n15. Objectivity : According to this concept, accounting transactions should be recorded in \nthe manner so that it is free from the bias of accountants and others.\nCh02.indd   42 9/29/2022   4:40:30 PM\n2024-25"

Under double entry system every \ntransaction has two-fold effects where as single entry system is known as incomplete records.\n17. Basis of Accounting:  The two broad approach of accounting are cash basis and accrual \nbasis. Under cash basis transactions are recorded only when cash are received or paid. Whereas under accrual basis, revenues or costs are recognises when they occur rather \nthan when they are paid.  \n18. Accounting Standards : Accounting standards are written statements of uniform \naccounting rules and guidelines in practice for preparing the uniform and consistent financial statements. These standards cannot over ride the provisions of applicable laws, customs, usages and business environment in the country.\n19. GST is a destination tax on the consumption of goods and services levied at all stages \nright from manufacturing up to the final consumption with credit of taxes paid at previous stages. \nQuestions for Practice\nShort Answers\n1. Why is it necessary for accountants to assume that business entity will remain a going \nconcern?\n2. When should revenue be recognised? Are there exceptions to the general rule?\n3. What is the basic accounting equation?\n4. The realisation concept determines when goods sent on credit to customers are to \nbe included in the sales figure for the purpose of computing the profit or loss for the accounting period.

In the process of preparing financial statements, the accountant of the firm  \nMr. Goyal fell ill and had to proceed on leave. Ruchica’s father was urgently in need of the statements as these had to be submitted to the bank, in pursuance of a loan of ` 5 lakh \napplied for the expansion of the business of the firm. Ruchica who is studying Accounting in her school, volunteered to complete the work. On scrutinising the accounts, the banker found that the value of building bought a few years back for ` 7 lakh has been shown in the \nbooks at ` 20 lakh, which is its present market value. Similarly, as compared to the last year, \nthe method of valuation of stock was changed, resulting in value of goods to be about 15 per cent higher. Also, the whole amount of ` 70,000 spent on purchase of personal computer (expected life 5 years) during the year had been charged to the profits of the current year. The banker did not rely on the financial data provided by Ruchica. Advise Ruchica for the mistakes committed by her in the preparation of financial statements in the context of basic concepts in accounting.\nActivity 2\nA customer has filed a suit against a trader who has supplied poor quality goods to him. \nIt is known that the court judgment will be in favour of the customer and the trader will be required to pay the damages. However, the amount of legal damages is not known with certainity. The accounting year has already been ended and the books are now finalised to ascertain true profit or loss. The accountant of the trader has advised him not to consider the expected loss on account of payment of legal damages because the amount is not certain \nand the final judgment of the court is not yet out.

The equation reads as\nfollows:\nA = L + C\nWhere,\nA  = Assets\nL  = Liabilities\nC  = Capital\nThe above equation can also be presented in the following forms as its\nderivatives to enable the determination of missing figures of Capital(C) or\nLiabilities(L).\n(i)A – L = C\n(ii)A – C = L\nSince, the accounting equation depicts the fundamental relationship among\nthe components of the balance sheet, it is also called the Balance Sheet\nEquation. As the name suggests, the balance sheet is a statement of assets,\nliabilities and capital.\nAt any point of time resources of the business entity must be equal to the\nclaims of those who have financed these resources.  The proprietors and\noutsiders provide the resources of the business. The claim of the proprietors\nis called capital  and that of the outsides is known as liabilities.  Each element\nof the equation is the part of balance sheet, which states the financial position\nof the business on a particular date. When we analyse the transactions, we\nactually try to know that how balance sheet of a business entity gets affected.\nAsset side of the balance sheet is the list of assets, which the business\nentity owns. The liabilities side of the balance sheet is the list of owner’s\nclaims and outsider’s claims, i.e., what the business entity owes. The equality\nof the assets side and the liabilities side of the balance sheet is an undeniable\nfact and this justifies the name of accounting equation as balance sheet\nequation also.\n2024-25"

Sources of this business entity is the contribution by\nRohit (Proprietor) ` 5,00,000 as Capital .\n(For the purpose of understanding we will refer this example as example 1,\nthroughout the chapter ) .\nIf we put this information in the form of equality of resources and sources,\nthe picture would emerge somewhat as follows:\nBooks of Rohit\nBalance Sheet as at ..........\nLiabilities Amount Assets Amount\n` `\nCapital 5,00,000 Cash in hand 5,00,000\n5,00,000 5,00,000\nIn the above balance sheet, the total assets are equal to the liabilities of\nthe business.

In double\nentry accounting, every transaction affects and is recorded in at least two\naccounts.  When recording each transaction, the total amount debited must equal\nto the total amount credited.           In accounting, the terms — debit and credit  indicate\nwhether the transactions are to be recorded on the left hand side or right hand\nside of the account. In its simplest form, an account looks like the letter T. Because\nof its shape, this simple form called a T-account (refer\nfigure 3.4). Notice that the T format has a left side and a right side for recording\nincreases and decreases in the item. This  helps in ascertaining the ultimate\nposition of each item at the end of an accounting period. For example, if it is\nan account of a customer all goods sold shall appear on the left (debit) side of\ncustomer’s account and all payments received on the right side. The difference\nbetween the totals of the two sides called balance  shall reflect the amount due\nto the customer. In a T account, the left side is called debit  (often abbreviated\nas Dr.) and the right side is known as credit  (often abbreviated as Cr.). To\n2024-25"

This process of analysing transactions and recording\ntheir effects directly in the accounts is helpful as a learning exercise. However, real\naccounting systems do not record transactions directly in the accounts. The book in\nwhich the transaction is recorded for the first time is called journal or book of original\nentry. The source document, as discussed earlier, is required to record the transaction\nin the journal. This practice provides a complete record of each transaction in one\nplace and links the debits and credits for each transaction. After the debits and\ncredits for each transaction are entered in the journal, they are transferred to the\nindividual accounts. The process of recording transactions in journal is called\njournalising. Once the journalising  process is completed, the journal entry provides\n2024-25"

Having\nwritten the Narration  a line is drawn in the Particulars column, which indicates\nthe end of recording the specific journal entry. The column relating to  Ledger\nFolio records the page number of the ledger book on which relevant account is\nappears. This column is filled up at the time of posting and not at the time of\nmaking journal entry.\nThe Debit amount  column records the amount against the account to be\ndebited and similarly the Credit Amount  column records the amount against\nthe account to be credited. It may be noted that, the number of transactions\nis very large and these are recorded in number of  pages in the journal book.\nHence, at the end of each page of the journal book, the amount columns are\ntotaled and carried forward (c/f) to the next page where such amounts are\nrecorded as brought forward (b/f) balances.\nThe journal entry is the basic record of a business transaction. It may be\nsimple or compound. When only two accounts are involved to record a\ntransaction, it is called a simple journal entry.\nFor Example, Goods Purchased on credit for Rs.30,000 from M/s Govind Traders\non December 24, 20 17, involves only two accounts : (a) Purchases A/c  (Goods), (b)\nGovind Traders A/c (Creditors).

Debit Credit\nAmount Amount\n` `\n2014\nDec.24 Purchases  A/c Dr. 30,000\nTo Govind Traders A/c 30,000\n(Purchase of goods- in-trade from\nGovind Traders)\nIt will be noticed that although the transaction results in an increase in stock\nof goods, the account debited is purchases, not goods. In fact, the goods account\nis divided into five accounts, viz.  purchases account, sales account, purchases\nreturns account, sales returns account, and stock account. When the number of\naccounts to be debited or credited is more than one, entry made for recording the\ntransaction is called compound  journal entry. That means compound journal\nentry involves multiple accounts. For example, Office furniture is purchased from\nModern Furniture’s on July 4, 2017 for ` 25,000 and ` 5,000 is paid by cash\nimmediately and balance of ` 20,000 is still payable. It increases furniture (assets)\nby ` 25,000, decreases cash (assets) by ` 5,000 and increases liability by ` 20,000.\nThe entry made in the journal on July 4, 2017 is :\n2024-25"

Balance,\nif any, will be applied to set off SGST.\n3.5 The Ledger\nThe ledger is the principal  book of accounting system. It contains different accounts\nwhere transactions relating to that account are recorded. A ledger is the collection of all\nthe accounts, debited or credited, in the journal proper and various special journal\n(about which you will learn in chapter 4). A ledger may be in the form of bound register,\nor cards, or separate sheets may be maintained in a loose leaf binder. In the ledger, each\naccount is opened preferably on separate page or card.\nUtility\nA ledger is very useful and is of utmost importance in the organisation. The net\nresult of all transactions in respect of a particular account on a given date can\nbe ascertained only from the ledger. For example, the management on a particular\ndate wants to know the amount due from a certain customer or the amount the\nfirm has to pay to a particular supplier, such information can be found only in\nthe ledger. Such information is very difficult to ascertain from the journal because\nthe transactions are recorded in the chronological order and defies classification.\nFor easy posting and location, accounts are opened in the ledger in some definite\norder. For example, they may be opened in the same order as they appear in the\nprofit and loss account and in balance sheet. In the beginning, an index is also\nprovided. For easy identification, in big organisations, each account is also\nallotted a code number.\nFormat of the account is shown in figure 3.6.\n2024-25"

All these accounts\nmay further be put into two groups, i.e. permanent accounts and temporary\naccounts. All permanent accounts are balanced and carried forward to the next\naccounting period. The temporary accounts are closed at the end of the\naccounting period by transferring them to the trading and profit and loss account.\nAll permanent accounts appears in the balance sheet. Thus, all assets, liabilities\nand capital accounts are permanent accounts and all revenue and expense\naccounts are temporary accounts. This classification is also relevant for preparing\nthe financial statements.\n3.6 Posting from Journal\nPosting is the process of transferring the entries from the books of original entry\n(journal) to the ledger. In other words, posting means grouping of all the\ntransactions in respect to a particular account at one place for meaningful\nconclusion and to further the accounting process.  Posting from the journal is\ndone periodically, may be, weekly or fortnightly or monthly as per the\nrequirements and convenience of the business.\nThe complete process of posting from journal to ledger has been discussed below:\nStep 1  : Locate in the ledger, the account to be debited as entered in the journal .\nStep 2  : Enter the date of transaction in the date column on the debit side.\nStep 3  : In the ‘Particulars’ column write the name of the account through which\nit has been debited in the journal. For example, furniture sold for cash ` 34,000.\nNow, in cash account on the debit side in the  particulars column ‘Furniture’ will\nbe entered signifying that cash is received from the sale of furniture. In Furniture\naccount, in the ledger on the credit side is the particulars column, the word,\ncash will be recorded. The same procedure is followed in respect of all the entries\nrecorded in the journal.\nStep 4 : Enter the page number of the journal in the folio column and in the journal\nwrite the page number of the ledger on which a particular account appears.\nStep 5  : Enter the relevant amount in the amount column on the debit side.\nIt may be noted that the same procedure is followed for making the entry on the\ncredit side of that account to be credited.

A small business may be able to record\nall its transactions in one book only, i.e., the journal.\nBut as the business expands and the number of\ntransactions becomes large, it may become\ncumbersome to jour-nalise each transaction. For\nquick, efficient and accurate recording of business\ntransactions, Journal is sub-divided into special\njournals. Many of the business transactions are\nrepetitive in nature. They can be easily recorded in\nspecial journals, each meant for recording all the\ntransactions of a similar nature. For example, all\ncash transactions may be recorded in one book, all credit\nsales transactions in another book and all credit\npurchases transactions in yet another book and so on.\nThese special journals are also called daybooks or\nsubsidiary books. Transactions that cannot be recorded\nin any special journal are recorded in journal called the\nJournal Proper. Special journals prove economical and\nmake division of labour possible in accounting work. In\nthis chapter we will discuss the following special purpose\nbooks:\n•Cash Book\n•Purchases Book\n•Purchase s Return  (Return  Outwards) Book\n•Sales Book\n•Sales Return (Return Inwards) Book\n•Journal ProperRecording of Transactions-II 4\nLEARNING  OBJECTIVES\nAfter studying this\nchapter, you will be able\nto :\n•state the need for\nspecial purpose books;\n•record the transactions\nin cash book and post\nthem in the ledger;\n•prepare the petty cash\nbook;\n•record the transactions\nin the special purpose\nbooks;\n•post the entries in the\nspecial purpose book\nand  to the ledger;\n•balance the ledger\naccounts.\n2024-25"

This helps in getting information about the position\nof the bank account from time to time. Just like cash transactions, all payments\ninto the bank are recorded on the left side and all withdrawals/payments through\nthe bank are recorded on the right side.

When a cheque is received, it may be\ndeposited into the bank on the same day or it may be deposited on another day.\nIn case, it is deposited on the same day the amount is recorded in the bank\ncolumn of the cash book on the receipts side. If the cheque is deposited on\nanother day, in that case, on the date of receipt it is treated as cash received and\nhence recorded in the cash column on the receipts side.

This is a contra entry .\nIf a cheque received from a customer is dishonoured, the bank will return\nthe dishonoured cheque and debit the firm’s account. On receipt of such\ncheque or intimation from the bank, the firm will make an entry on the credit\nside of the cash book by entering the amount of the dishonoured cheque in\nthe bank column and the name of the customer in the particulars column.\nThis entry will restore the position prevailing before the receipt of the cheque\nform the customer and its deposit in the bank.

These are generally repetitive in nature. If\nall these payments are handled by the cashier and are recorded in the main\ncash book, the procedure is found to be very cumbersome. The cashier may\nbe overburdened and the cash book may become very bulky. To avoid this,\nlarge organisations normally appoint one more cashier (petty cashier) and\nmaintain a separate cash book to record these transactions. Such a cash\nbook maintained by petty cashier is called petty cash book.\nThe petty cashier works on the Imprest system . Under this system, a definite\nsum, say ` 2,000 is given to the petty cashier at the beginning of a certain\nperiod. This amount is called imprest amount. The petty cashier goes on making\nall small payments out of this imprest amount and when he has spent the\nsubstantial portion of the imprest amount say `1,780, he gets reimbursement\nof the amount spent from the head cashier. Thus, he again has the full imprest\namount in the beginning of the next period. The reimbursement may be made\non a weekly, fortnightly or monthly basis, depending on the frequency of small\npayments. (In certain cases, the petty cash system is operated through the\n2024-25"

In such instances, the petty cash book is not maintained\nindependently.)\nThe petty cash book generally has a number of columns for the amount on\nthe payment side (credit) besides the first other amount column. Each of the\namount columns is allotted for items of specific payments, which are most\ncommon. The last amount column is designated as ‘Miscellaneous’ followed by\na ‘Remarks’ column. In the miscellaneous column those payments are recorded\nfor which a separate column does not exist. In the ‘Remarks’ the nature of\npayment is recorded. At the end of the period, all amount columns are totaled.\nThe total amount column l shows the total amount spent and to be reimbursed.\nOn the receipt (debit) side, there is only one amount column. Columns for the\ndate, voucher number and particulars are common for both receipts and\npayments.\nBox  1\nAdvantages of Maintaining Petty Cash Book\n1.Saving of Time and efforts of chief cashier : The chief cashier is not required to\ndeal with petty disbursements. He can concentrate on cash transactions involving\nlarge amount of cash. It saves time and labour and helps chief cashier to discharge\nhis duties more effectively\n2.Effective control over cash disbursements:  Cash control becomes easy because of\ndivision of work. The head cashier can control big payments directly and petty\npayments by keeping a proper check on the petty cashier. This way the chances\nof making frauds and embezzlements become very difficult.\n3.Convenient recording: Recording of petty disbursements in the main cash book\nmakes it bulky and unmanageable. Further, the materiality principle requires\nthat insignificant details need not be given in the main cashbook. This way the\ncash book reveals only material and useful information.\nRecording of such small payments becomes easy as the totals of different types\nof expenses are posted to ledger. It also saves time and effort of posting individual\nitems in the ledger. In nutshell it can be stated that preparation of petty cash\nbook is a cost reduction control measure.\nFor example, Mr. Mohit, the petty cahier of M/s Samaira Traders received\nRupees 2,000 on May 01, 2017 from the Head Cashier. For the month, details\nof petty expenses are listed here under:\n2024-25"

The difference between the total\nreceipts and total payments is the balance with the petty cashier. The balance is\ncarried to the next period and the petty cashier is paid the amount actually spent.\nA petty cash account is opened in the ledger. It is debited with the amount given\nto petty cashier. Each expense account is individually debited with the periodic\ntotal as per the respective column by writing “petty cash account” and the petty\ncash account is credited with the total expenditure incurred during the period by\nwriting sundries as per petty cash book. The petty cash account is balanced. It\nreflect the  actual cash with the petty cashier.\n2024-25"

                "text": "160 Accountancy\nIn chapter 4, you have learnt that\nthe business organisations keep a record of their\ncash and bank transactions in a cash book. The\ncash book also serves the purpose of both the cash\naccount and the bank account and shows the\nbalance of both at the end of the period.\nOnce the cash book has been balanced, it is\nusual to check its details with the records of the\nfirm’s bank transactions as recorded by the bank.\nTo enable this check, the cashier needs to ensure\nthat the cash book is completely up to date and a\nrecent bank statement (or a bank passbook) has\nbeen obtained from the bank. A bank statement\nor a bank passbook is a copy of a bank account as\nshown by the bank records. This enable the bank\ncustomers to check their funds in the bank\nregularly and update their own records of\ntransactions that have occurred. An illustrative\nbank passbook of a current account is shown in\nfigure 5.1.\nThe amount of balance shown in the passbook\nor the bank statement must tally with the balance\nas shown in the cash book. But in practice, these\nare usually found to be different. Hence, we have\nto ascertain the causes for such difference. It will\nbe observed that a bank statement/passbook\nshows all deposits in the credit column and\nwithdrawals in the debit column. Thus, if deposits\nexceed withdrawals it shows a credit balance and\nif withdrawals exceed deposits it will show a debit\nbalance (overdraft).LEARNING  OBJECTIVES\nAfter studying this\nchapter, you will be able\nto :\n•state the meaning and\nneed for the preparation\nof bank reconciliation\nstatement;\n•identify causes of\ndifference between\nbank balance as per\ncash book and pass\nbook;\n•prepare the bank\nreconciliation statement;\n•ascertain the correct\nbank balance as per\ncash book;Bank Reconciliation Statement 5\n2024-25"

The differences between the\ncash book and the bank passbook is caused by:\n•timing differences on  recording of the transactions.\n•errors  made by the business or by the bank.\n5.1.1 Timing Differences5.1.1 Timing Differences5.1.1 Timing Differences5.1.1 Timing Differences5.1.1 Timing Differences\nWhen a business compares the balance of its cash book with the balance\nshown by the bank passbook, there is often a difference, which is caused\nby the time gap in recording the transactions relat ing either to payments\nor receipts. The factors affecting time gap includes :\n5.1.1(a) Cheques issued by the bank but not yet presented for payment\nWhen cheques are issued by the firm to suppliers or creditors of the firm,\nthese are immediately entered on the credit side of the cash book. However,\nthe receiving party may not present the cheque to the bank for payment\nimmediately. The bank will debit the firm’s account only when these cheques\nare actually paid by the bank. Hence,  there is a time lag between the issue of\na cheque and its presentation to the bank which may cause the difference\nbetween the two balances.\n5.1.1(b) Cheques paid into the bank but not yet collected\nWhen firm receives cheques from its customers ( debtors), they are\nimmediately recorded in the debit side  of the cash book. This increases\nthe bank balance as per the cash book . However, the bank credits the\ncustomer account only when the amount of cheques are actually realised.\nThe clearing of cheques generally takes few days especially in case of\noutstation cheques or when the cheques are paid-in at a bank branch\nother than the one at which the account of the firm is maintained. This\nleads to a cause of difference between the bank balance shown by the\ncash book and the balance shown by the bank passbook.\n5.1.1(c) Direct debits made by the bank on behalf of the customer\nSometimes, the bank deducts amount for various services from the account\nwithout the firm’s knowledge. The firm comes to know about it only when\nthe bank statement arrives. Examples of such deductions include: cheque\ncollection charges, incidental charges, interest on overdraft, unpaid cheques\ndeducted by the bank – i.e. , stopped or bounced, etc. As a result, the balance\nas per passbook will be less than the balance as per cash book.\n2024-25"

But, the firm does not receive the intimation from any source till\nit receives the bank statement. In this case, the bank records the receipts in the\nfirm’s account at the bank but the same is not recorded in the firm’s cash book.\nAs a result, the balance shown in the bank passbook will be more than the\nbalance shown in the firm’s cash book.\n5.1.1(e) Interest and dividends collected by the bank\nWhen the bank collects interest and dividend on behalf of the customer, then these\nare immediately credited to the customers account. But the firm will know about\nthese transactions and record the same in the  cash book only when it receives a\nbank statement . Till then the balances as per the cash book and passbook will\ndiffer.\n5.1.1(f) Direct payments made by the bank on behalf of the customers\nSometimes the customers give standing instructions to the bank to make some\npayment regularly on stated days to the third parties. For example, telephone\nbills, insurance premium, rent, taxes, etc. are directly paid by the bank on behalf\nof the customer and debited to the account. As a result, the balance as per the\nbank passbook would be less than the one shown in the cash book.\n5.1.1(g) Cheques deposited/bills discounted dishonoured\nIf a cheque deposited by the firm is dishonoured or a bill of exchange drawn by\nthe business firm is discounted with the bank is dishonoured on the date of\nmaturity, the same is debited to customer’s account by the bank. As this\ninformation is not available to the firm immediately, there will be no entry in\nthe firm’s cash book regarding the above items. This will be known to the firm\nwhen it receives a statement  from the bank. As a result, the balance as per\nthe passbook would be less than the cash book balance.\n5.1.2 Differences Caused by Errors5.1.2 Differences Caused by Errors5.1.2 Differences Caused by Errors5.1.2 Differences Caused by Errors5.1.2 Differences Caused by Errors\nSometimes the difference between the two balances may be accounted for by\nan error on the part of the bank or an error in the cash book of the business.\nThis causes difference between the bank balance shown by the cash book\nand the balance shown by the bank statement.\n2024-25"

The debit balance as\nper the cash book means the balance of deposits held at the bank. Such a\nbalance will be a credit balance as per the passbook. Such a balance exists\nwhen the deposits made by the firm are more than its withdrawals. It indicates\nthe favourable balance as per cash book or favourable balance as per the\npassbook . On the other hand, the credit balance as per the cash book indicates\nbank overdraft . In other words, the excess amount withdrawn over the amount\ndeposited in the bank. It is also known as unfavourable balance as per cash\nbook or unfavourable balance as per passbook.\n2024-25"

                "text": "Accountancy 180\nIn the earlier chapters, you have learnt about the\nbasic principles of accounting that for every debit\nthere will be an equal credit. It implies that if the\nsum of all debits equals the sum of all credits, it is\npresumed that the posting to the ledger in terms\nof debit and credit amounts is accurate. The trial\nbalance is a tool for verifying the correctness of\ndebit and credit amounts. It is an arithmetical\ncheck under the double entry system which verifies\nthat both aspects of every transaction have been\nrecorded accurately.  This chapter explains the\nmeaning and process of preparation of trial balance\nand the types of errors and their rectification.\n6.1 Meaning of Trial Balance\nA trial b alance is a statement showing the\nbalances, or total of debits and credits, of all the\naccounts in the ledger with a view to verify the\narithmatical accuracy of posting into the ledger\naccounts. Trial balance is an important statement\nin the accounting process as it shows the final\nposition of all accounts and helps in preparing the\nfinal statements. The task of preparing the\nstatements is simplified because the accountant\ncan take the balances of all accounts from the trial\nbalance instead of going through the whole ledger.\nIt may be noted that the trial balance is usually\nprepared with the balances of ac counts.Trial Balance and Rectification of Errors 6\nLEARNING  OBJECTIVES\nAfter studying this chapter,\nyou will be able to :\n•state the meaning of\ntrial balance;\n•enumerate  the objectives\nof preparing trial\nbalance ;\n•prepare trial balance;\n•explain the types of\nerrors;\n•state various process\nof locating errors ;\n•identify the errors which\naffect the agreement of\ntrial balance and those\nwhich do not affect the\nagreement of trial\nbalance;\n•rectify the errors\nwithout preparing\nsuspense account;\nand\n•rectify the errors with\nsuspense account.\n2024-25"

However, an\norganisation may prepare a trial balance at the end of any chosen period,\nwhich may be monthly, quarterly, half yearly or annually depending upon its\nrequirements.\nIn order to prepare a trial balance following steps are taken:\n•Ascertain the balances of each account in the ledger.\n•List each account and place its balance in the debit or credit column, as\nthe case may be. (If an account has a zero balance, it may be included in\nthe trial balance with zero in the column for its normal balance).\n•Compute the total of debit balances column.\n•Compute the total of the credit balances column.\n•Verify that the sum of the debit balances equal the sum of credit balances.\nIf they do not tally, it indicate that there are some errors.

It may be noted that all\nassets expenses and receivables account shall have debit balances whereas\nall liabilities, revenues and payables accounts shall have credit balances\n(refer figure 6.2).\n6.2 Objectives of Preparing the Trial Balance\nThe trial balance is prepared to fulfill the following objectives :\n1.To ascertain the arithmetical accuracy of the ledger accounts.\n2.To help in locating errors.\n3.To help in the preparation of the financial statements.

                "text": "183 Trial Balance and Rectification of Errors\nand credit balances in the trial balance are equal, it is assumed that the posting\nand balancing of accounts is arithmetically correct. However, the tallying of the\ntrial balance is not a conclusive proof of the accuracy of the accounts. It only\nensures that all debits and the corresponding credits have been properly recorded\nin the ledger.\n6.2.2 To Help in Locating Errors6.2.2 To Help in Locating Errors6.2.2 To Help in Locating Errors6.2.2 To Help in Locating Errors6.2.2 To Help in Locating Errors\nWhen a trial balance does not tally (that is, the totals of debit and credit columns\nare not equal), we know that at least one error has occured. The error (or errors)\nmay have occured at one of those stages in the accounting process: (1) totalling\nof subsidiary books, (2) posting of journal entries in the ledger, (3) calculating\naccount balances, (4) carrying account balances to the trial balance, and (5)\ntotalling the trial balance columns.\nIt may be noted that the accounting accuracy is not ensured even if the\ntotals of debit and credit balances are equal because some errors do not affect\nequality of debits and credits. For example, the book-keeper may debit a correct\namount in the wrong account while making the journal entry or in posting a\njournal entry to the ledger. This error would cause two accounts to have\nincorrect balances but the trial balance would tally. Another error is to record\nan equal debit and credit of an incorrect amount. This error would give the\ntwo accounts incorrect balances but would not create unequal debits and\ncredits. As a result, the fact that the trial balance has tallied does not imply\nthat all entries in the books of original record (journal, cash book, etc.) have\nbeen recorded and posted correctly. However, equal totals do suggest that\nseveral types of errors probably have not occured.\n6.2.3 To Help in the Preparation of the Financial Statements6.2.3 To Help in the Preparation of the Financial Statements6.2.3 To Help in the Preparation of the Financial Statements6.2.3 To Help in the Preparation of the Financial Statements6.2.3 To Help in the Preparation of the Financial Statements\nTrial balance is considered as the connecting link between accounting records\nand the preparation of financial statements. For preparing a financial\nstatement, one need not refer to the ledger. In fact, the availability of a tallied\ntrial balance is the first step in the preparation of financial statements. All\nrevenue and expense accounts appearing in the trial balance are transferred\nto the trading and profit and loss account and all liabilities, capital  and assets\naccounts are transferred to the balance sheet.\n(Preparation of the financial statements is explained in chapters, 9 and 10).\n2024-25"

The total of\ndebit column of trial balance should agree with the total of credit column in the\ntrial balance because the accounts are based on double entry system. However,\nthis method is not widely used in practice, as it does not help in assuming accuracy\nof balances of various accounts and and preparation of the fianancial statements.\n6.3.2 Balances Method6.3.2 Balances Method6.3.2 Balances Method6.3.2 Balances Method6.3.2 Balances Method\nThis is the most widely used method in practice. Under this method trial balance\nis prepared by showing the balances of all ledger accounts and then totalling up\nthe debit and credit columns of the trial balance to assure their correctness. The\naccount balances are used because the balance summarises the net effect of all\ntransactions relating to an account and helps in preparing the financial\nstatements. It may be noted that in trial balance, normally in place of balances\nin individual accounts of the debtors, a figure of sundry debtors is shown, and\nin place of individual accounts of creditors, a figure of sundry creditors is shown.\n6.3.3 Totals-cum-balances Method6.3.3 Totals-cum-balances Method6.3.3 Totals-cum-balances Method6.3.3 Totals-cum-balances Method6.3.3 Totals-cum-balances Method\nThis method is a combination of totals method and balances method. Under\nthis method four columns for amount are prepared. Two columns for writing\nthe debit and credit totals of various accounts and two columns for writing\nthe debit and credit balances of these accounts. However, this method is also\nnot used in practice because it is time consuming and hardly serves any\nadditional or special purpose.\nLet us now learn how will the trial balance be prepared using each of\nthese methods with the help of the following example:\nMr. Rawat’s ledger shows the following accounts for his business.

                "text": "189 Trial Balance and Rectification of Errors\n6.4. Significance of Agreement of Trial Balance\nIt is important for an accountant that the trial balance should tally. Normally a tallied\ntrial balance means that both the debit and the credit entries have been made correctly\nfor each transaction. However, as stated earlier, the agreement of trial balance is not\nan absolute proof of accuracy of accounting records. A tallied trial balance only proves,\nto a certain extent, that the posting to the ledger is arithmetically correct. But it does\nnot guarantee that the entry itself is correct. There can be errors, which affect the\nequality of debits and credits, and there can be errors, which do not affect the equality\nof debits and credits. Some common errors include the following:\n•Error in totalling of the debit and credit balances in the trial balance.\n•Error in totalling of subsidiary books.\n•Error in posting of the total of subsidiary books.\n•Error in showing account balances in wrong column of the tiral balance, or\nin the wrong amount.\n•Omission in showing an account balance in the trial balance.\n•Error in the calculation of a ledger account balance.\n•Error while posting a journal entry: a journal entry may not have been posted\nproperly to the ledger, i.e., posting made either with wrong amount or on the\nwrong side of the account or in the wrong account.\n•Error in recording a transaction in the journal: making a reverse entry, i.e.,\naccount to be debited is credited and amount to be credited is debited, or an\nentry with wrong amount.\n•Error in recording a transaction in subsidiary  book with wrong name or wrong\namount.\n6.4.1 Classification of Errors6.4.1 Classification of Errors6.4.1 Classification of Errors6.4.1 Classification of Errors6.4.1 Classification of Errors\nKeeping in view the nature of errors, all the errors can be classified into the\nfollowing four categories:\n•Errors of Commission\n•Errors of Omission\n•Errors of Principle\n•Compensating Errors\n6.4.2 Errors of Commission6.4.2 Errors of Commission6.4.2 Errors of Commission6.4.2 Errors of Commission6.4.2 Errors of Commission\nThese are the errors which are committed due to wrong posting of transactions,\nwrong totalling or wrong balancing of the accounts, wrong casting of the\nsubsidiary books, or wrong recording of amount in the books of original entry,\netc. For example: Raj Hans Traders paid ` 25,000 to Preetpal Traders (a supplier\nof goods).

These can be of two\ntypes:\n(i)error of complete omission\n(ii)error of partial omission\nWhen a transaction is completely omitted from recording in the books of\noriginal record, it is an error of complete omission. For example, credit sales\nto Mohan ` 10,000, not entered in the sales book. When the recording of\ntransaction is partly omitted from the books, it is an error of partial omission.\nIf in the above example, credit sales had been duly recorded in the sales book\nbut the posting from sales book to Mohan’s account has not been made, it\nwould be an error of partial omission.\n6.4.4 Errors of Principle6.4.4 Errors of Principle6.4.4 Errors of Principle6.4.4 Errors of Principle6.4.4 Errors of Principle\nAccounting entries are recorded as per the generally accepted accounting\nprinciples. If any of these principles are violated or ignored, errors resulting\nfrom such violation are known as errors of principle. An error of principle may\noccur due to incorrect classification of expenditure or receipt between capital\nand revenue. This is very important because it will have an impact on financial\nstatements. It may lead to under/over stating of income or assets or liabilities,\netc. For example, amount spent on additions to the buildings should be treated\nas capital expenditure and must be debited to the asset account. Instead, if\nthis amount is debited to maintenance and repairs account, it has been treated\nas a revenue expense. This is an error of principle. Similarly, if a credit purchase\nof machinery is recorded in purchases book instead of journal proper or rent\npaid to the landlord is recorded in the cash book as payment to landlord,\nthese errors of principle. These errors do not affect the trial balance.\n6.4.5 Compensating Errors6.4.5 Compensating Errors6.4.5 Compensating Errors6.4.5 Compensating Errors6.4.5 Compensating Errors\nWhen two or more errors are committed in such a way that the net effect of these\nerrors on the debits and credits of accounts is nil, such errors are called\ncompensating errors. Such errors do not affect the tallying of the trial balance.\nFor example, if purchases book has been overcast by ` 10,000 resulting in\nexcess debit of ` 10,000 in purchases account and sales returns book is\nundercast by ` 10,000 resulting in short debit to sales returns account is a\n2024-25"

One plus is set off by the\nother minus, the net effect of these two errors is nil and so they do not affect the\nagreement of trial balance.\n6.5 Searching of Errors\nIf the trial balance does not tally, it is a clear indication that at least one error\nhas occured. The error (or errors) needs to be located and corrected before\npreparing the financial statements.\nIf the trial balance does not tally, the accountant should take the following\nsteps to detect and locate the errors :\n•Recast the totals of debit and credit columns of the trial balance.\n•Compare the account head/title and amount appearing in the trial balance,\nwith that of the ledger to detect any difference in amount or omission of an\naccount.\n•Compare the trial balance of current year with that of the previous year to\ncheck additions and deletions of any accounts and also verify whether\nthere is a large difference in amount, which is neither expected nor\nexplained.\n•Re-do and check the correctness of balances of individual accounts in\nthe ledger.\n•Re-check the correctness of the posting in accounts from the books of\noriginal entry.\n•If the difference between the debit and credit columns is divisible by 2,\nthere is a possibility that an amount equal to one-half of the difference\nmay have been posted to the wrong side of another ledger account. For\nexample, if the total of the debit column of the trial balance exceeds by\n` 1,500, it is quite possible that a credit item of `750 may have been wrongly\nposted in the ledger as a debit item. To locate such errors, the accountant\nshould scan all the debit entries of an amount of ` 750.\n•The difference may also indicate a complete omission of a posting. For\nexample, the difference of ` 1,500 given above may be due to omissions of a\nposting of that amount on the credit side. Thus, the accountant should verify\nall the credit items with an amount of ` 1,500.\n•If the difference is a multiple of 9 or divisible by 9, the mistake could be due\nto transposition of figures. For example, if a debit amount of ` 459 is posted\nas ` 954, the debit total in the trial balance will exceed the credit side by\n` 495 (i.e. 954 – 459 = 495). This difference is divisible by 9. A mistake due\nto wrong placement of the decimal point may also be checked by this method.\nThus, a difference in trial balance divisible by 9 helps in checking the errors\nfor a transposed mistake.\n2024-25"

Such errors are rectified\nby passing a nullifying entry in the respective account as explained before under\n6.6.2.\n6.6.1 Rectification of Errors which do not Affect the Trial Balance6.6.1 Rectification of Errors which do not Affect the Trial Balance6.6.1 Rectification of Errors which do not Affect the Trial Balance6.6.1 Rectification of Errors which do not Affect the Trial Balance6.6.1 Rectification of Errors which do not Affect the Trial Balance\nThese errors are committed in two or more accounts. Such errors are also known\nas two sided errors. They can be rectified by recording a journal entry giving the\ncorrect debit and credit to the concerned accounts.\nExamples of such errors are – complete omission to record an entry in the\nbooks of original entry; wrong recording of transactions in the book of accounts;\ncomplete omission of posting to the wrong account on the correct side, and\nerrors of principle.\nThe rectification process essentially involves:\n•Cancelling the effect of wrong debit or credit by reversing it; and\n•Restoring the effect of correct debit or credit.\nFor this purpose, we need to analyse the error in terms of its effect on the\naccounts involved which may be:\n(i) Short debit or credit in an account; and/or\n(ii) Excess debit or credit in an account.\nTherefore, rectification entry can be done by:\n(i) debiting the account with short debit or with excess credit,\n(ii) crediting the account with excess debit or with short credit.\nThe procedure for rectification for such errors is explained with the help of\nfollowing examples:\n(a)Credit sales to Mohan ` 10,000 were not recorded in the sales book. This is an error\nof complete omission. Its affect is that Mohan’s account has not been debited and\nSales account has not been credited. Accordingly, recording usual entry for credit\nsales will rectify the error.\n2024-25"

This ensures ascertainment of\nthe correct amount of profit or loss. If some cost is\nincurred whose benefit extend to more than one\naccounting period, it is not justified to charge the\nentire cost as expense in the year in which it is\nincurred. In fact, such a cost must be spread over\nthe periods in which it provides benefits.\nDepreciation, on fixed assets, which is the main\nsubject matter of the present chapter, deals with such\na situation. Further, it may not always be possible\nto ascertain with certainty the amount of some\nparticular expense. Recall the principle of\nconservatism (prudence) which requires that instead\nof ignoring such items of costs, adequate provision\nmust be made and charged against profits of the\ncurrent period. Moreover, a part of profit may be\nretained in the business in the form of reserves to\nprovide for growth, expansion or meeting certain\nspecific needs of the business in future. This  chapter\ndeals with two distinct topics and hence is being\npresented in two different sections.

                "text": "227 Depreciation, Provisions and Reserves\naccounting year. Fixed assets (technically referred to as “depreciable assets”)\ntend to reduce their value once they are put to use. In general, the term\n“Depreciation” means decline in the value of a fixed assets due to use, passage\nof time or obsolescence. In other words, if a business enterprise procures a\nmachine and uses it in production process then the value of machine declines\nwith its usage. Even if the machine is not used in production process, we can\nnot expect it to realise the same sales price due to the passage of time or\narrival of a new model (obsolescence). It implies that fixed assets are subject\nto decline in value and this decline is technically referred to as depreciation .\nAs an accounting term, depreciation is that part of the cost of a fixed asset\nwhich has expired on account of its usage and/or lapse of time. Hence,\ndepreciation is an expired cost or expense, charged against the revenue of a\ngiven accounting period. For example, a machine is purchased for `1,00,000\non April 01, 2017. The useful life of the machine is estimated to be 10 years. It\nimplies that the machine can be used in the production process for next 10\nyears till March 31, 2016. You know that by its very nature, ` 1,00,000 is a\ncapital expenditure during the year 2017-18. However, when income statement\n(Statement of Profit and Loss) is prepared, the entire amount of `1,00,000 can\nnot be charged against the revenue for the year 2017-18, because of the reason\nthat the capital expenditure amounting to `1,00,000 is expected to derive  benefits\n(or revenue) for 10 years and not one year. Therefore, it is logical to charge only\na part of the total cost say `10,000  (one tenth of  ` 1,00,000) against the revenue\nfor the year 2017-18. This part represents the expired cost or loss in the value\nof machine on account of its use or passage of time and is referred to as\n‘Depreciation’. The amount of depreciation, being a charge against profit, is\ndebited to Income Statement (Statement of Profit and Loss).\n7.1.1 Meaning of Depreciation7.1.1 Meaning of Depreciation7.1.1 Meaning of Depreciation7.1.1 Meaning of Depreciation7.1.1 Meaning of Depreciation\nDepreciation may be described as a permanent, continuing and gradual\nshrinkage in the book value of fixed assets. It is based on the cost of assets\nconsumed in a business and not on its market value.\nAccording to Institute of Cost and Management Accounting, London (ICMA)\nterminology “The depreciation is the diminution in intrinsic value of the asset\ndue to use and/or lapse of time.”\nAccounting Standard-6 issued by The Institute of Chartered Accountants\nof India (ICAI) defines depreciation as “a measure of the wearing out, consumption\nor other loss of value of depreciable asset arising from use, effluxion of time or\nobsolescence through technology and market-change. Depreciation is allocated\nso as to charge fair proportion of depreciable amount in each accounting period\nduring the expected useful life of the asset. Depreciation includes amortisation\nof assets whose useful life is pre-determined”.\n2024-25"

Depreciation is allocated so as to charge\nfair proportion of depreciable amount in each accounting period during the\nexpected useful life of the asset. Depreciation includes amortisation of assets\nwhose useful life is pre-determined”.\n•Depreciation has a significant effect in determining and presenting the financial\nposition and results of operations of an enterprise. Depreciation is charged in\neach accounting period by reference to the extent of the depreciable amount.\n•The subject matter of depreciation, or its base, are ‘depreciable’ assets which.\n•“are expected to be used during more than one accounting period.\n•have a limited useful life; and\n•are held by an enterprise for use in production or supply of goods and services,\nfor rental to others, or for administrative purposes and not for the purpose of\nsale in the ordinary course of business.”\n•The amount of depreciation basically depends upon three factors, i.e. Cost, Useful\nlife and Net realisable value.\n•Cost of a fixed asset is “the total cost spent in connection with its acquisition,\ninstallation and commissioning as well as for add item or improvement of the\ndepreciable asset”.\n•Useful life of an asset is the “period over which it is expected to be used by the\nenterprise”.\n•There are two main methods of calculating depreciation amount.\n•straight line method\n•written down value method\n•Selection of appropriate method depends upon the following factors:\n•type of the asset\n•nature of the use of such asset\n•circumstances prevailing in the business.\n•The selected depreciation method should be applied consistently from period to\nperiod. Change in depreciation method may be allowed only under specific\ncircumstances.\nDepreciation has a significant effect in determining and presenting the\nfinancial position and results of operations of an enterprise. Depreciation is\ncharged in each accounting period by reference to the extent of the depreciable\namount. It should be noted that the subject matter of depreciation, or its\nbase, are ‘depreciable’ assets which:\n•“are expected to be used during more than one accounting period;\n•have a limited useful life; and\n•are held by an enterprise for use in production or supply of goods and\nservices, for rental to others, or for administrative purposes and not for\nthe purpose of sale in the ordinary course of business.”\n2024-25"

It has been described as “either (i) the period over which a\ndepreciable asset is expected to the used by the enterprise, or (ii) the number\nof production of similar units expected to be obtained from the use of the\nasset by the enterprise.”\n7.1.2 Features of Depreciation7.1.2 Features of Depreciation7.1.2 Features of Depreciation7.1.2 Features of Depreciation7.1.2 Features of Depreciation\nAbove mentioned discussion on depreciation highlights the following features\nof depreciation:\n1.It is decline in the book value of fixed assets.\n2.It includes loss of value due to effluxion of time, usage or obsolescence.\nFor example, a business firm buys a machine for ` 1,00,000 on  April 01,\n2017. In the year 2017, a new version of the machine arrives in the market.\nAs a result, the machine bought by the business firm becomes outdated.\nThe resultant decline in the value of old machine is caused by obsolescence.\n3.It is a continuing process.\n4.It is an expired cost and hence must be deducted before calculating taxable\nprofits. For example, if profit before depreciation and tax is ` 50,000, and\ndepreciation is ` 10,000; profit before tax will be:\n  (`)\nProfit before depreciation & tax 50,000\n (-) Depreciation (10,000)\nProfit before tax  40,000\n5.It is a non-cash expense. It does not involve any cash outflow. It is the\nprocess of writing-off the capital expenditure already incurred.\nDo it Yourself\n Look at your surroundings and identify at least five depreciable assets in your home,\nschool, hospital, printing press and in a bakery.\n2024-25"

This has been due to the similar treatment given\nto them in accounting on the basis of similarity of their outcome, as they represent\nthe expiry of the usefulness of different assets.\n7.2.1 Depletion7.2.1 Depletion7.2.1 Depletion7.2.1 Depletion7.2.1 Depletion\nThe term depletion is used in the context of extraction of natural resources like\nmines, quarries, etc. that reduces the availability of the quantity of the material\nor asset. For example, if a business enterprise is into mining business and\npurchases a coal mine for ` 10,00,000. Then the value of coal mine declines\nwith the extraction of coal out of the mine. This decline in the value of mine is\ntermed as depletion . The main difference between depletion and depreciation is\nthat the former is concerned with the exhaution of economic resources, but the\nlatter relates to the usage of an asset. In spite of this, the result is erosion in the\nvolume of natural resources and expiry of the service potential. Therefore,\ndepletion and depreciation are given similar accounting treatment.\n7.2.2 Amortisation7.2.2 Amortisation7.2.2 Amortisation7.2.2 Amortisation7.2.2 Amortisation\nAmortisation refers to writing-off the cost of intangible assets like patents,\ncopyright, trade marks, franchises, goodwill which have utility for a specified\nperiod of time. The procedure for amortisation or periodic write-off of a portion\nof the cost of intangible assets is the same as that for the depreciation of fixed\nassets. For example, if a business firm buys a patent for ` 10,00,000 and\nestimates that its useful life will be 10 years then the business firm must write-\noff  ` 10,00,000 over 10 years. The amount so written- off is technically referred\nto as amortisation.\n7.3 Causes of Depreciation\nThese have been very clearly spelt out as part of the definition of depreciation in\nthe Accounting Standard 6 and are being elaborated here.\n7.3.1 Wear and Tear due to Use or Passage of Time7.3.1 Wear and Tear due to Use or Passage of Time7.3.1 Wear and Tear due to Use or Passage of Time7.3.1 Wear and Tear due to Use or Passage of Time7.3.1 Wear and Tear due to Use or Passage of Time\nWear and tear means deterioration, and the consequent diminution in an assets\nvalue, arising from its use in business operations for earning  revenue. It reduces\nthe asset’s technical capacities to serve the purpose for, which it has been meant.\nAnother aspect of wear and tear is the physical deterioration. An asset\ndeteriorates simply with the passage of time, even though they are not being put\nto any use. This happens especially when the assets are exposed to the rigours\nof nature like weather, winds, rains, etc.\n2024-25"

In ordinary\nlanguage, obsolescence means the fact of being “out-of-date”. Obsolescence\nimplies to an existing asset becoming out-of-date on account of the availability\nof better type of asset. It arises from such factors as:\n•Technological changes;\n•Improvements in production methods;\n•Change in market demand for the product or service output of the asset;\n•Legal or other description.\n7.3.4 Abnormal Factors7.3.4 Abnormal Factors7.3.4 Abnormal Factors7.3.4 Abnormal Factors7.3.4 Abnormal Factors\nDecline in the usefulness of the asset may be caused by abnormal factors such as\naccidents due to fire, earthquake, floods, etc. Accidental loss is permanent but\nnot continuing or gradual. For example, a car which has been repaired after an\naccident will not fetch the same price in the market even if it has not been used.\n7.4 Need for Depreciation\nThe need for providing depreciation in accounting records arises from conceptual,\nlegal, and practical business consideration. These considerations provide\ndepreciation a particular significance as a business expense.\n7.4.1 Matching of Costs and Revenue7.4.1 Matching of Costs and Revenue7.4.1 Matching of Costs and Revenue7.4.1 Matching of Costs and Revenue7.4.1 Matching of Costs and Revenue\nThe rationale of the acquisition of fixed assets in business operations is that these\nare used in the earning of revenue. Every asset is bound to undergo some wear\nand tear, and hence lose value, once it is put to use in business. Therefore,\ndepreciation is as much the cost as any other expense incurred in the normal\ncourse of business like salary, carriage, postage and stationary, etc. It is a charge\nagainst the revenue of the corresponding period and must be deducted before\narriving at net profit according to ‘Generally Accepted Accounting Principles’.\n7.4.2 Consideration of Tax7.4.2 Consideration of Tax7.4.2 Consideration of Tax7.4.2 Consideration of Tax7.4.2 Consideration of Tax\nDepreciation is a deductible cost for tax purposes.

According to Accounting Standand-6 of ICAI, cost of a fixed asset is\n“the total cost spent in connection with its acquisition, installation and\ncommissioning as well as for addition or improvement of the depreciable asset”.\nFor example, a photocopy machine is purchased for ` 50,000 and ` 5,000 is\nspent on its transportation and installation. In this case the original cost of the\nmachine is ` 55,000 (i.e. ` 50,000 + `5,000 ) which will be written-off as\ndepreciation over the useful life of the machine.\n7.5.2 Estimated Net Residual Value7.5.2 Estimated Net Residual Value7.5.2 Estimated Net Residual Value7.5.2 Estimated Net Residual Value7.5.2 Estimated Net Residual Value\nNet Residual value (also known as scrap value or salvage value for accounting\npurpose) is the estimated net realisable value (or sale value) of the asset at the\nend of its useful life. The net residual value is calculated after deducting the\nexpenses necessary for the disposal of the asset. For example, a machine is\npurchased for  ` 50,000 and is expected to have a useful life of 10 years. At the\nend of 10th  year it is expected to have a sale value of ` 6,000 but expenses\nrelated to its disposal are estimated at ` 1,000. Then its net residual value shall\nbe ` 5,000 (i.e. ` 6,000 – ` 1,000).\n7.5.3 Depreciable Cost7.5.3 Depreciable Cost7.5.3 Depreciable Cost7.5.3 Depreciable Cost7.5.3 Depreciable Cost\nDepreciable cost of an asset is equal to its cost (as calculated in point 7.5.1\nabove)  less     net residual value (as calculated in point 7.5.2,) Hence, in the above\nexample, the depreciable cost of machine is ` 45,000 (i.e., ` 50,000 –\n` 5,000.) It is the depreciable cost, which is distributed and charged as\ndepreciation expense over the estimated useful life of the asset. In the above\nexample, ` 45,000 shall be charged as depreciation over a period of 10 years. It\nis important to mention here that total amount of depreciation charged over the\nuseful life of the asset must be equal to  the depreciable cost. If total amount of\ndepreciation charged is less than the depreciable cost then the capital expenditure is\nunder recovered. It violates the principle of proper matching of revenue and expense.\n7.5.4 Estimated Useful Life7.5.4 Estimated Useful Life7.5.4 Estimated Useful Life7.5.4 Estimated Useful Life7.5.4 Estimated Useful Life\nUseful life of an asset is the estimated economic or commercial life of the asset.\nPhysical life is not important for this purpose because an asset may still exist\nphysically but may not be capable of commercially viable production. For\nexample, a machine is purchased and it is estimated that it can be used in\nproduction process for 5 years. After 5 years the machine may still be in good\nphysical condition but can’t be used for production profitably, i.e., if it is still\nused the cost of production may be very high. Therefore, the useful life of the\nmachine is considered as 5 years irrespective of its physical life.

Normally,\nuseful life is shorter than the physical life. The useful life of an asset is expressed\nin number of years but it can also be expressed in other units, e.g., number of\nunits of output (as in case of mines) or number of working hours. Useful life\ndepends upon the following factors :\n•Pre-determined by legal or contractual limits, e.g., in case of leasehold asset,\nthe useful life is the period of lease.\n•The number of shifts for which asset is to be used.\n•Repair and maintenance policy of the business organisation.\n•Technological obsolescence.\n•Innovation/improvement in production method.\n•Legal or other restrictions.\n7.6 Methods of Calculating Depreciation Amount\nThe depreciation amount to be charged for during an accounting year depends\nupon depreciable amount and the method of allocation.

Besides\nthese two main methods there are other methods such as – annuity method,\ndepreciation fund method, insurance policy method, sum of years digit method,\ndouble declining method, etc. which may be used for determining the amount of\ndepreciation.

By such accumulation of depreciation the asset account\nneed not be disturbed in any way and it continues to be shown at its original\ncost over the successive years of its useful life. There are some basic characteristic\nof this method of recording depreciation. These are given below:\n•Asset account continues to appear at its original cost year after year over its\nentire life;\n•Depreciation is accumulated on a separate account instead of being adjusted\nin the asset account at the end of each accounting period.\nThe following journal entries are recorded under this method:\n1.For recording purchase of asset (only in the year of purchase)\nAsset A/c Dr. (with the cost of asset including\ninstallation, expenses etc.)\nTo  Bank/Vendor A/c (cash/credit purchase)\n2.Following two journal entries are recorded at the end of each year:\n(a) For crediting depreciation amount to provision for depreciation account\nDepreciation A/c Dr. (with the amount of depreciation)\nTo Provision for depreciation A/c\n(b) For charging depreciation to profit and loss account\nProfit & Loss A/c Dr. (with the amount of depreciation)\nTo Depreciation A/c\n3.Balance sheet treatment\nIn the balance sheet, the fixed asset continues to appear at its original cost on the asset\nside.

The\nconcerned variables are the original cost of the asset, depreciation accumulated\non the asset upto date, sale price of the asset, value of the parts of the asset\nretained for use, if any and the resultant profit or loss on disposal. The balance\nof this amount is transferred to the profit and loss account.\nThis method is generally used when a part of the asset is sold  and provision\nfor depreciation account exists.\nUnder this method, a new account titled Asset Disposal Account   is opened.\nThe original cost of the asset being sold is debited to the asset disposal account\nand accumulated depreciation amount appearing in provision for depreciation\naccount relating to that asset till the date of disposal is credited to the asset\ndisposal account. The net amount realised from the sale of the asset is also\ncredited to this account. The balance of asset disposal account shows profit\nor loss which is transferred to profit and loss account. The advantage of this\nmethod is that it gives a full picture of all the transactions related to asset\ndisposal at one place. The journal entries required for the preparation of asset\ndisposal account is as follows:\n1. Asset Disposal A/c Dr.(with the original cost of asset,\nTo Asset A/c being sold)\n2.

It is necessary to make provision for such items for ascertaining\ntrue net profit. For example, a trader who sells on credit basis knows that\nsome of the debtors of the current period would default and would not pay or\nwould pay only partially. It is necessary to take into account such an expected\nloss while calculating true and fair profit/loss according to the principle of\nPrudence or Conservatism. Therefore, the trader creates a Provision for Doubtful\nDebts  to take care of expected loss at the time of realisation from debtors.  In\na similar way, Provision for repairs and renewals may also be created to provide\nfor expected repair and renewal of the fixed assets. Examples of provisions are :\n•Provision for depreciation;\n•Provision for bad and doubtful debts;\n•Provision for taxation;\n•Provision for discount on debtors; and\n•Provision for repairs and renewals.\nIt must be noted that the amount of provision for expense and loss is a\ncharge against the revenue of the current period. Creation of provision ensures\nproper matching of revenue and expenses and hence the calculation of true\nprofits. Provisions are created by debiting the profit and loss account. In the\nbalance sheet, the amount of provision may be shown either:\n•By way of deduction from the concerned asset on the assets side. For example,\nprovision for doubtful debts is shown as deduction from the amount of\nsundry debtors and provision for depreciation as a deduction from the\nconcerned fixed assets;\n•On the liabilities side of the balance sheet alongwith current liabilities, for\nexample provision for taxes and provision for repairs and renewals.\n2024-25"

Therefore,\nthe accounting treatment is explained here taking up the case of provision for\ndoubtful debts.\nAs already stated that when business transaction takes place on credit basis,\ndebtors account is created and its balance is shown on the asset-side of the\nbalance sheet. These debtors may be of three types:\n•Good Debtors are those from where collection of debt is certain.\n•Bad Debts  are those debtors from where collection of money is not\npossible and the amount of credit given is a certain loss.\n•Doubtful Debts are those debtors who may pay but business firm is not\nsure about the collection of full amount from them. In fact, as a matter\nof business experience, some percentage of such debtors are not likely\nto pay, hence treated as doubtful debts. To consider this possible loss\non account of non-payment by some debtors, it is a common practice\n(and necessary also) to make a suitable provision for doubtful debts at\nthe time of ascertaining true profit or loss. The provision for doubtful\ndebts is usually calculated as a certain percentage of the total amount\ndue from sundry debtors after deducting/writing-off all known bad\ndebts. Provision for doubtful debts is also called ‘Provision for bad and\ndoubtful debts’. It is created by debiting the amount of required provision\nto the profit and loss account and crediting it to provision for doubtful\ndebts account.\nFor creating a provision for doubtful debts  the following journal entry\nis recorded:\nProfit and Loss A/c Dr. (with the amount of provision)\nTo Provision for doubtful debts A/c\nThis is explained with the help of the following example\nObserve an extract of the trial balance from the books of Trehan Traders\non March 31, 2014 is given below:\nDate Account title L.F. Debit Credit\nAmount Amount\n` `\nSundry Debtors 68,000\nAdditional Information\n•Bad debts proved bad but not recorded amounted to ` 8,000\n•Provision is to be maintained at 10% of debtors.\n2024-25"

Hence, net profit cannot be calculated unless all\nprovisions have been debited to profit and loss account, while a reserve is\ncreated after the calculation of net profit.\n2.Purpose  : Provision is made for a known liability or expense pertaining to\ncurrent accounting period, the amount of which is not certain. On the\nother hand reserve is created for strengthening the financial position of\nthe business. Some reserves are also mandatory under the law.\n3.Presentation in balance sheet : Provision is shown either (i) by way of deduction\nfrom the item on the asset side for which it is created, or (ii) on the liabilities\nside along with current liabilities. On the other hand, reserve is shown on\nthe liabilities side after capital.\n4.Effect on taxable profits  : Provision is deducted before calculating taxable\nprofits. Hence, it reduces taxable profits. A reserve is created from profit\nafter tax and therefore it has no effect on taxable profit.\n5.Element of compulsion  : Creation of provision is necessary to ascertain true\nand fair profit or loss in compliance with ‘Prudence’ or ‘Conservatism’ concept.\nIt has to be made even if there are no profits. Whereas creation of a reserve is\ngenerally at the discretion of the management. However, in certain cases law\nhas stipulated for the creation of specific reserves such as Debenture\nRedemption Reserve. Reserve cannot be created unless there are profits.\n6.Use for the payment of dividend : Provision cannot be used for distribution\nas dividends while general reserve can be used for dividend distribution.\nBasis of Difference Provision Reserve\n1.Basic nature Charge against profit.

Management may resort to creation of secret reserve by charging higher\ndepreciation than required. It is termed as ‘Secret Reserve’, as it is not known to\noutside stakeholders. Secret reserve can also be created by way of :\n•Undervaluation of inventories/stock\n•Charging capital expenditure to profit and loss account\n•Making excessive provision for doubtful debts\n•Showing contingent liabilities as actual liabilities\nCreation of secret reserves within reasonable limits is justifiable on grounds of\nexpediency, prudence and preventing competition from other firms.\n2024-25"
