Step by step, we work out the meaning of the\nterms involved in this definition. The aim here is to understand clearly the\nbare minimum features of a democratic form of government. After going\nthrough this chapter we should be able to distinguish a democratic form\nof government from a non-democratic government. Towards the end of\nthis chapter, we step beyond this minimal objective and introduce a broader\nidea of democracy.\nDemocracy is the most prevalent form of government in the world today\nand it is expanding to more countries. But why is it so? What makes it\nbetter than other forms of government? That is the second big question\nthat we take up in this chapter.CHAPTER 1\nWha t is\nDemocr acy?\nWhy\nDemocr acy?\n2024-25"

We\nmust not accept something just because it is\nfamous, just because everyone accepts it.\nYolanda : Ma’am, can I suggest something? W e don’t\nneed to look for any definition. I read somewhere\nthat the word democracy comes from a Greek\nword ‘Demokratia’. In Greek ‘demos’ means\npeople and ‘kratia’ means rule. So democracy is\nrule by the people. This is the correct meaning.\nWhere is the need to debate?\nLyngdoh Madam : That is also a very helpful way\nof thinking about this matter . I would just say\nthat this does not always work. A word does not\nremain tied to its origin. Just think of computers.\nOriginally they were used for computing, that is to\nsay calculating, very difficult mathematical sums.\nThese were ver y power ful calculators. But nowa-\ndays very few people use computers for comput-\ning sums. They use it for writing, for designing, for\nlistening to music and for watching films. Words\nremain the same but their meaning can change\nwith time. In that case it is not very useful to look\nat the origins of a word.\nMerry : Ma’am, so basically what you are saying\nis that there is no shortcut to our thinking about\nthe matter ourselves. We have to think about its\nmeaning and evolve a definition.\nLyngdoh Madam : You got me right. Let us get on\nwith it now .\nACTIVITY\nLet us take Lyngdoh Madam seriously and try to\nwrite down the exact definition of some of the\nsimple words that we use all the time: pen, rain\nand love. For example, is there a way of defining a\npen that distinguishes it clearly from a pencil, a\nbrush, a chalk or crayon.\n/UIstopWhat have you learnt from this attempt?\n/UIstopWhat does it teach us about understanding the\nmeaning of democracy?\nA simple definitionA simple definitionA simple definitionA simple definitionA simple definition\nLet us get back to our discussion on\nsimilarities and differences among\ngovernments that are calledYou have already read about different\nforms of government. On the basis of\nyour understanding of democracy\nso far, mentioning a few examples\nwrite down some common features of:\n/UIstopDemocratic governments\n/UIstopNon-democratic governments\nWhy define democracy?Why define democracy?Why define democracy?Why define democracy?Why define democracy?\nBefore we proceed further, let us\nfirst take note of an objection by\nMerry. She does not like this way\nof defining democracy and wants\nto ask some basic questions.\nHer teacher Matilda Lyngdoh\nresponds to her questions, as other\nclassmates join the discussion:\nMerry : Ma’am, I don’t like this idea. First we spend\ntime discussing democracy and then we want\nto find out the meaning of democracy . I mean\nlogically shouldn’t we have approached it the\nother way round? Shouldn’t the meaning have\ncome first and then the example?\nLyngdoh Madam: I can see your point. But that is\nnot how we reason in everyday life. We use\nwords like pen, rain or love. Do we wait to have\na definition of these words before we use them?\nCome to think of it, do we have clear definition\nof these words? It is only by using a word that\nwe understand its meaning.\nMerry : But then why do we need definitions at all?\nLyngdoh Madam : We need a definition only when\nwe come across a difficulty in the use of a word.\nWe need a definition of rain only when we wish to\ndistinguish it from, say , drizzle or cloudburst. The\nsame is tr ue for democracy . We need a clear\ndefinition only because people use it for different\npurposes, because very different kinds of gov-\nernments call themselves democracy .\nRibiang : But why do we need to work on a defini-\ntion? The other day you quoted Abraham\nLincoln to us: “Democracy is government of\nthe people, by the people and for the people”.\nWe in Meghalaya always ruled ourselves. That\nis accepted by everyone. Why do we need to\nchange that?\nLyngdoh Madam : I am not saying we need to\nchange it. I too find this definition very beautiful.\n2024-25"

This time she\ndid not mention the names of the people who said or wrote these. She wants you to read these and\ncomment on how good or useful these thoughts are:\n/UIstopDemocracy gives ever y man the right to be his own oppressor .\n/UIstopDemocracy consists of choosing your dictators after they’ve told you what you think it is you want\nto hear .\n/UIstopMan’s capacity for justice makes democracy possible, but man’s inclination to injustice makes\ndemocracy necessary\n/UIstopDemocracy is a device that insures we shall be governed no better than we deserve.\n/UIstopAll the ills of democracy can be cured by more democracy .democracies. One simple factor\ncommon to all democracies is: the\ngovernment is chosen by the people.\nWe could thus start with a simple\ndefinition: democracy is a form of\ngovernment in which the rulers are\nelected by the people.\nThis is a useful starting point. This\ndefinition allows us to separate\ndemocracy from forms of government\nthat are clearly not democratic. The\narmy rulers of Myanmar were not\nelected by the people. Those who\nhappened to be in control of the army\nbecame the rulers of the country.\nPeople had no say in this decision.\nDictators like Pinochet (Chile) are not\nelected by the people. This also\napplies to monarchies. The kings of\nSaudi Arabia rule not because the\npeople have chosen them to do so butbecause they happen to be born into\nthe royal family.\nThis simple definition is not\nadequate. It reminds us that\ndemocracy is people’s rule. But if we\nuse this definition in an unthinking\nmanner, we would end up calling\nalmost every government that holds\nan election a democracy. That would\nbe very misleading. As we shall find\nout in Chapter 3, every government\nin contemporary world wants to be\ncalled a democracy, even if it is not\nso. That is why we need to carefully\ndistinguish between a government\nthat is a democracy and one that\npretends to be one. We can do so by\nunderstanding each word in this\ndefinition carefully and spelling out\nthe features of a democratic\ngovernment.\nThis car toon was\ndrawn when elections\nwere held in Iraq with\nthe presence of US\nand other foreign\npowers.

The work of the civilian\ncabinet is supervised by a National\nSecurity Council which is\ndominated by military officers. After\npassing this law, elections were\nheld to the national and provincial\nassemblies. So Pakistan has had\nelections, elected representatives\nhave some powers. But the final\npower rested with military officers\nand General Musharraf himself.\nClearly, there are many reasons\nwhy Pakistan under General\nMusharraf should not be called a\ndemocracy. But let us focus on one\nof these. Can we say that the rulers\nare elected by the people in\nPakistan? Not quite. People may\nhave elected their representatives to\nthe national and provincial\nassemblies but those elected\nrepresentatives were not really therulers. They cannot take the final\ndecisions. The power to take final\ndecision rested with army officials\nand with General Musharraf, and\nnone of them were elected by the\npeople. This happens in many\ndictatorships and monarchies. They\nformally have an elected parliament\nand government but the real power\nis with those who are not elected.\nIn a few countries, the real power\nwas with some external powers and\nnot with locally elected\nrepresentatives.

The PRI was\nknown to use many dirty tricks to\nwin elections. All those who were\nemployed in government offices\nhad to attend its party meetings.\nTeachers of government schools\nused to force parents to vote for the\nPRI. Media largely ignored the\nactivities of opposition political\nparties except to criticise them.\nSometimes the polling booths were\nshifted from one place to another in\nthe last minute, which made it\ndifficult for people to cast their votes.\nThe PRI spent a large sum of money\nin the campaign for its candidates.\nShould we consider the elections\ndescribed above as examples of\npeople electing their rulers? Reading\nthese examples we get a sense that\nwe cannot. There are many problems\nhere. In China the elections do not\noffer the people any serious choice.\nThey have to choose the ruling party\nand the candidates approved by it.\nCan we call this a choice? In the\nMexican example, people seemed to\nreally have a choice but in practice\nthey had no choice. There was no\nway the ruling party could be\ndefeated, even if people were against\nit. These are not fair elections.\nWe can thus add a second feature\nto our understanding of democracy.\nHolding elections of any kind is not\nsufficient. The elections must offer\na real choice between political\nalternatives. And it should be\npossible for people to use this choice\nto remove the existing rulers, if they\nwish so. So, a democracy must be\nbased on a free and fair election\nwhere those currently in power\nhave a fair chance of losing.

Its leader,\nRobert Mugabe, ruled the country\nsince independence. Elections were\nheld regularly and always won by\nZANU-PF. President Mugabe was\npopular but also used unfair practices\nin elections. Over the years his\ngovernment changed the constitution\nseveral times to increase the powers\nof the President and make him less\naccountable. Opposition party\nworkers were harassed and their\nmeeting disrupted. Public protests\nand demonstrations against the\ngovernment were declared illegal.\nThere was a law that limited the right\nto criticise the President. Television\nand radio were controlled by the\ngovernment and gave  only the\nruling party’s version. There were\nindependent newspapers but thegovernment harasse d those\njournalists who went against it. The\ngovernment ignored some court\njudgments that went against it and\npressurised judges.  He was forced\nout of office in 2017.\nThe example of Zimbabwe shows\nthat popular approval of the rulers is\nnecessary in a democracy, but it is\nnot sufficient. Popular governments\ncan be undemocratic. Popular leaders\ncan be autocratic. If we wish to assess\na democracy, it is important to look\nat the elections. But it is equally\nimportant to look before and after the\nelections. There should be sufficient\nroom for normal political activity,\nincluding political opposition, in the\nperiod before elections. This requires\nthat the state should respect some\nbasic rights of the citizen.

The existence of\ndemocracy in India made the\nIndian government respond to food\nscarcity in a way that the Chinese\ngovernment did not. They point out\nthat no large-scale famine has ever\ntaken place in an independent and\ndemocratic country. If China too had\nmultiparty elections, an opposition\nparty and a press free to criticise the\ngovernment, then so many people\nmay not have died in the famine.\nThis example brings out one of the\nreasons why democracy is considered\nthe best form of government.\nDemocracy is better than any other\nform of government in responding to\nthe needs of the people. A non-\ndemocratic government may and can\nrespond to the people’s needs, but it\nall depends on the wishes of the\npeople who rule. If the rulers don’t\nwant to, they don’t have to act\naccording to the wishes of the people.\nA democracy requires that the rulers\nhave to attend to the needs of the\npeople. A democratic government is\na better government because it is a\nmore accountable form of\ngovernment .\nThere is another reason why\ndemocracy should lead to better\ndecisions than any non-democratic\ngovernment. Democracy is based on\nconsultation and discussion. A\ndemocratic decision always involves\nmany persons, discussions and\nmeetings. When a number of people\nput their heads together, they are\nable to point out possible mistakes\nin any decision. This takes time. But\nthere is a big advantage in taking\ntime over important decisions. This\nreduces the chances of rash or\nirresponsible decisions. Thus\ndemocracy improves the quality\nof decision-making.This is related to the third\nargument. Democracy provides a\nmethod to deal with differences\nand conflicts. In any society people\nare bound to have differences of\nopinions and interests. These\ndifferences are particularly sharp in\na country like ours which has an\namazing social diversity. People\nbelong to different regions, speak\ndifferent languages, practise\ndifferent religions and have different\ncastes. They look at the world very\ndifferently and have different\npreferences. The preferences of one\ngroup can clash with those of other\ngroups. How do we resolve such a\nconflict? The conflict can be solved\nby brutal power. Whichever group\nis more powerful will dictate its\nterms and others will have to accept\nthat. But that would lead to\nresentment and unhappiness.\nDifferent groups may not be able to\nlive together for long in such a way.\nDemocracy provides the only\npeaceful solution to this problem. In\ndemocracy, no one is a permanent\nwinner. No one is a permanent loser.\nDifferent groups can live with one\nanother peacefully. In a diverse\ncountry like India, democracy keeps\nour country together.\nThese three arguments were about\nthe effects of democracy on the\nquality of government and social life.\nBut the strongest argument for\ndemocracy is not about what\ndemocracy does to the government.\nIt is about what democracy does to\nthe citizens. Even if democracy does\nnot bring about better decisions and\naccountable government, it is still\nbetter than other forms of\ngovernment. Democracy enhances\nthe dignity of citizens . As we\ndiscussed above, democracy is\nbased on the principle of political\nequality, on recognising that theWhat would have\nhappened if India\nwas not a\ndemocracy?\nCould we have\nstayed together as\na single nation?\nWHAT IS DEMOCRAC Y?

For\nthis we need to turn to broader\nmeanings of democracy.\nSometimes we use democracy for\norganisations other than the\ngovernment. Just read these\nstatements:\n/UIstop“We are a very democratic family.\nWhenever a decision has to be taken,\nwe all sit down and arrive at a\nconsensus. My opinion matters as much\nas my father’s .”\n/UIstop“I don’t like teachers who do not allow\nstudents to speak and ask questions in\nthe class. I would like to have teachers\nwith democratic temperament. ”\n/UIstop“One leader and his family members\ndecide everything in this party. How can\nthey talk of democracy? ”\nThese ways of using the word\ndemocracy go back to its basic\nsense of a method of taking\ndecisions. A democratic decision\ninvolves consultation with and\nconsent of all those who are affected\nby that decision. Those who are not\npowerful have the same say in\ntaking the decision as those who are\npowerful. This can apply to a\ngovernment or a family or any other\norganisation. Thus democracy is\nalso a principle that can be applied\nto any sphere of life.\nSometimes we use the word\ndemocracy not to describe any\nexisting government but to set up\nan ideal standard that all\ndemocracies must aim to become:\n/UIstop“True democracy will come to this\ncountry only when no one goes hungry\nto bed. ”\n/UIstop“In a democracy every citizen must be\nable to play equal role in decision\nmaking. For this you don’t need just an\nequal right to vote. Every citizen needs\nto have equal information, basic\neducation, equal resources and a lot of\ncommitment. ”If we take these ideals seriously,\nthen no country in the world is a\ndemocracy. Yet an understanding of\ndemocracy as an ideal reminds us\nof why we value democracy. It\nenables us to judge an existing\ndemocracy and identify its\nweaknesses. It helps us to\ndistinguish between a minimal\ndemocracy and a good democracy.\nIn this book we do not deal much\nwith this expanded notion of\ndemocracy. Our focus here is with\nsome core institutional features of\ndemocracy as a form of government.\nNext year you will read more about\na democratic society and ways of\nevaluating our democracy. At this\nstage we just need to note that\ndemocracy can apply to many\nspheres of life and that democracy\ncan take many forms. There can be\nvarious ways of taking decisions in\na democratic manner, as long as the\nbasic principle of consultation on an\nequal basis is accepted. The most\ncommon form of democracy in\ntoday’s world is rule through\npeople’s elected representatives. We\nshall read more about that in\nChapter 3. But if the community is\nsmall, there can be other ways of\ntaking democratic decisions. All the\npeople can sit together and take\ndecisions directly.

                "text": "22 DEMOCRA TIC POLITICS\nAfter long negotiations both parties\nagreed to a compromise. The whites\nagreed to the principle of majority\nrule and that of one person one vote.\nThey also agreed to accept some\nbasic rights for the poor and the\nworkers. The blacks agreed that\nmajority rule would not be absolute.\nThey agreed that the majority would\nnot take away the property of the white\nminority. This compromise was not\neasy. How was this compromise going\nto be implemented? Even if they\nmanaged to trust each other, what\nwas the guarantee that this trust will\nnot be broken in future?\nThe only way to build and\nmaintain trust in such a situation\nis to write down some rules of the\ngame that everyone would abide by.\nThese rules lay down how the rulers\nare to be chosen in future. These\nrules also determine what the\nelected governments are empowered\nto do and what they cannot do.\nFinally these rules decide the rights\nof the citizen. These rules will work\nonly if the winner cannot change\nthem very easily. This is what the\nSouth Africans did. They agreed on\nsome basic rules. They also agreed\nthat these rules will be supreme,\nthat no government will be able to\nignore these. This set of basic rules\nis called a constitution.\nConstitution making is not unique\nto South Africa. Every country has\ndiverse groups of people. Their\nrelationship may not have been as\nbad as that between the whites and\nthe blacks in South Africa. But all over\nthe world people have differences of\nopinion and interests. Whether\ndemocratic or not, most countries in\nthe world need to have these basic\nrules. This applies not just to\ngovernments. Any association needs\nto have its constitution. It could be a\nclub in your area, a cooperativesociety or a political party, they all\nneed a constitution.\nACTIVITY\nApproach a club or cooperative society or union or\npolitical par ty in your locality . Get a copy of their\nrule book (it is of ten called R ules of Association)\nand read it. Are these r ules in accordance with\nprinciples of democracy? Do they give membership\nto any person without discrimination?\nThus, the constitution of a country\nis a set of written rules that are\naccepted by all people living together\nin a country. Constitution is the\nsupreme law that determines the\nrelationship among people living in\na territory (called citizens) and also\nthe relationship between the people\nand government. A constitution does\nmany things:\n/UIstopFirst, it generates a degree of trust\nand coordination that is necessary\nfor different kind of people to live\ntogether;\n/UIstopSecond, it specifies how the\ngovernment will be constituted,\nwho will have power to take which\ndecisions;\n/UIstopThird, it lays down limits on the\npowers of the government and tells\nus what the rights of the citizens\nare; and\n/UIstopFourth, it expresses the\naspirations of the people about\ncreating a good society.\nAll countries that have constitutions\nare not necessarily democratic. But\nall countries that are democratic will\nhave constitutions. After the War of\nIndependence against Great Britain,\nthe Americans gave themselves a\nconstitution. After the Revolution, the\nFrench people approved a democratic\nconstitution. Since then it has\nbecome a practice in all democracies\nto have a written constitution.This is not fair!\nWhat was the point\nin having a\nConstituent\nAssembly in India if\nall the basics were\nalready decided?\n2024-25"

Much of this consensus had\nevolved during the freedom struggle.\nOur national movement was not\nmerely a struggle against a foreign\nrule. It was also a struggle to\nrejuvenate our country and to\ntransform our society and politics.\nThere were sharp differences of\nopinion within the freedom struggle\nabout the path India should take\nafter Independence. Such\ndifferences exist even today. Yet\nsome basic ideas had come to be\naccepted by almost everyone.\nAs far back as in 1928, Motilal\nNehru and eight other Congress\nleaders drafted a constitution for\nIndia. In 1931, the resolution at the\nKarachi session of the Indian\nNational Congress dwelt on how\nindependent India’s constitution\nshould look like. Both these\ndocuments were committed  to the\ninclusion of universal adult franchise,\nright to freedom and equality and to\nprotecting the rights of minorities in\nthe constitution of independent India.\nThus some basic values were\naccepted by all leaders much before\nthe Constituent Assembly  met to\ndeliberate on the Constitution.\nThe familiarity with political\ninstitutions of colonial rule also\nhelped develop an agreement over\nthe institutional design. The British\nrule had given voting rights only to\na few. On that basis the British had\nintroduced very weak legislatures.\nElections were held in 1937 to\nProvincial Legislatures and\nMinistries all over British India.\nThese were not fully democratic\ngovernments. But the experience\ngained by Indians in the working of\nthe legislative institutions proved to\nbe very useful for the country in\nsetting up its own institutions andLike South Africa, India’s\nConstitution was also drawn up\nunder very difficult circumstances.\nThe making of the constitution for a\nhuge and diverse country like India\nwas not an easy affair. At that time\nthe people of India were emerging\nfrom the status of subjects to that\nof citizens. The country was born\nthrough a partition on the basis of\nreligious differences. This was a\ntraumatic experience for the people\nof India and Pakistan.\nAtleast ten lakh people were killed\non both sides of the border in\npartition related violence. There was\nanother problem. The British had\nleft it to the rulers of the princely\nstates to decide whether they\nwanted to merge with India or with\nPakistan or remain independent.\nThe merger of these princely states\nwas a difficult and uncertain task.\nWhen the constitution was being\nwritten, the future of the country did\nnot look as secure as it does today.\nThe makers of the constitution had\nanxieties about the present and the\nfuture of the country.\nACTIVITY\nSpeak to your grandparents or some other elders\nin your locality .

That is why the\nIndian constitution adopted many\ninstitutional details and procedures\nfrom colonial laws like the Government\nof India Act , 1935.\nYears of thinking and deliberation\non the framework of the constitution\nhad another benefit. Our leaders\ngained confidence to learn from\nother countries, but on our own\nterms. Many of our leaders were\ninspired by the ideals of French\nRevolution, the practice of\nparliamentary democracy in Britain\nand the Bill of Rights in the US. The\nsocialist revolution in Russia had\ninspired many Indians to think of\nshaping a system based on social\nand economic equality. Yet they\nwere not simply imitating what\nothers had done.

Write a shor t\nnote on him or her , following the same style as\nused here: Name (year of bir th-year of death),\nplace of bir th (by cur rent political boundaries),\nbrief description of political activities; role played\nafter the Constituent Assembly .\nThe drafting of the document called\nthe constitution was done by an\nassembly of elected representativescalled the Constituent Assembly.\nElections to the Constituent\nAssembly were held in July 1946. Its\nfirst meeting was held in December\n1946. Soon after, the country was\ndivided into India and Pakistan. The\nConstituent Assembly was also\ndivided into the Constituent Assembly\nof India and that of Pakistan. The\nConstituent Assembly that wrote\nthe Indian constitution had 299\nmembers. The Assembly adopted\nthe Constitution on 26 November\n1949 but it came into effect on 26\nJanuary 1950. To mark this day we\ncelebrate January 26 as Republic\nDay every year.\nWhy should we accept the\nConstitution made by this Assembly\nmore than seven decades ago? We\nhave already noted one reason\nabove. The Constitution does not\nreflect the views of its members\nalone. It expresses a broad\nconsensus of its time. Many\ncountries of the world have had to\nrewrite their Constitution afresh\nbecause the basic rules were not\nacceptable to all major social groups\nor political parties. In some other\ncountries, the Constitution exists\nas a mere piece of paper. No one\nactually follows it. The experience\nof our Constitution is different. Over\nthe last half a century, several\ngroups have questioned some\nprovisions of the Constitution. But\nno large social group or political\nparty has ever questioned the\nlegitimacy of the Constitution itself.\nThis is an unusual achievement for\nany constitution.\nThe second reason for accepting\nthe Constitution is that the\nConstituent Assembly represented\nthe people of India. There was no\nuniversal adult franchise at that\ntime. So the Constituent Assembly\ncould not have been chosen directly\nby all the people of India.

This\nensured a fair geographical share of\nmembers from all the regions of the\ncountry. The Assembly was\ndominated by the Indian National\nCongress, the party that led India’s\nfreedom struggle. But the Congress\nitself included a variety of political\ngroups and opinions. The Assembly\nhad many members who did not\nagree with the Congress. In social\nterms too, the Assembly represented\nmembers from different language\ngroups, castes, classes, religions\nand occupations. Even if the\nConstituent Assembly was elected\nby universal adult franchise, its\ncomposition would not have been\nvery different.\nFinally, the manner in which the\nConstituent Assembly worked gives\nsanctity to the Constitution. TheConstituent Assembly worked in a\nsystematic, open and consensual\nmanner. First some basic principles\nwere decided and agreed upon. Then\na Drafting Committee chaired by Dr.\nB.R. Ambedkar prepared a draft\nconstitution for discussion. Several\nrounds of thorough discussion took\nplace on the Draft Constitution,\nclause  by clause. More than two\nthousand amendments were\nconsidered. The members\ndeliberated for 114 days spread over\nthree years.

It is a very long and\ndetailed document. Therefore it needs\nto be amended quite regularly to keep\nit updated. Those who crafted the\nIndian Constitution felt that it has to\nbe in accordance with people’s\naspirations and changes in society.\nThey did not see it as a sacred, static\nand unalterable law.

The most common form of\ndemocracy in our times is for the people to govern through their\nrepresentatives. In this chapter we will look at how these representatives\nare elected. We begin by understanding why elections are necessary and\nuseful in a democracy. We try to understand how electoral competition\namong parties serves the people. We then go on to ask what makes an\nelection democratic. The basic idea here is to distinguish democratic\nelections from non-democratic elections.\nThe rest of the chapter tries to assess elections in India in the light of\nthis yardstick. We take a look at each stage of elections, from the drawing\nof boundaries of different constituencies to the declaration of results. At\neach stage we ask what should happen and what does happen in elections.\nTowards the end of the chapter, we turn to an assessment of whether\nelections in India are free and fair.

There are more than\none hundred countries in the world\nin which elections take place to\nchoose people’s representatives. We\nalso read that elections are held in\nmany countries that are not\ndemocratic.\nBut why do we need elections?\nLet us try to imagine a democracy\nwithout elections. A rule of the\npeople is possible without any\nelections if all the people can sit\ntogether everyday and take all the\ndecisions. But as we have already\nseen in Chapter 1, this is not\npossible in any large community.\nNor is it possible for everyone to\nhave the time and knowledge to\ntake decisions on all matters.\nTherefore in most democracies\npeople rule through their\nrepresentatives.\nIs there a democratic way of\nselecting representatives without\nelections? Let us think of a place\nwhere representatives are selected\non the basis of age and experience.\nOr a place where they are chosen\non the basis of education or\nknowledge. There could be some\ndifficulty in deciding on who is more\nexperienced or knowledgable. But let\nus say the people can resolve these\ndifficulties. Clearly, such a place\ndoes not require elections.But can we call this place a\ndemocracy? How do we find out if\nthe people like their representatives\nor not? How do we ensure that these\nrepresentatives rule as per the\nwishes of the people? How to make\nsure that those who the people don’t\nlike do not remain their\nrepresentatives? This requires a\nmechanism by which people can\nchoose their representatives at\nregular intervals and change them\nif they wish to do so. This\nmechanism is called election.\nTherefore, elections are considered\nessential in our times for any\nrepresentative democracy.\nIn an election the voters make\nmany choices:\n/UIstopThey can choose who will make\nlaws for them.\n/UIstopThey can choose who will form the\ngovernment and take major\ndecisions.\n/UIstopThey can choose the party whose\npolicies will guide the government\nand law making.\nW WW WWha haha hahat mak t makt mak t makt mak es an ele es an elees an ele es an elees an ele c cc cction tiontion tiontiondemocr democrdemocr democrdemocr a aa aatic? tic?tic? tic?tic?\nElections can be held in many ways.\nAll democratic countries hold\nelections.

We\ndiscussed many examples of\ncountries where elections are held\nbut they can’t really be called\ndemocratic elections. Let us recall\nwhat we learnt there and start with\na simple list of the minimum\nconditions of a democratic election:\n/UIstopFirst, everyone should be able to\nchoose.

This competition takes\nvarious forms. The most obvious form\nis the competition among political\nparties. At the constituency  level, it\ntakes the form of competition among\nseveral candidates. If there is no\ncompetition, elections will become\npointless.\nBut is it good to have political\ncompetition? Clearly, an electoral\ncompetition has many demerits. It\ncreates a sense of disunity and\n‘factionalism’ in every locality. You\nwould have heard of people\ncomplaining of ‘party-politics’ in your\nlocality. Different political parties and\nleaders often level allegations against\none another. Parties and candidates\noften use dirty tricks to win elections.\nSome people say that this pressure\nto win electoral fights does not allow\nsensible long-term policies to be\nformulated. Some good people whomay wish to serve the country do not\nenter this arena. They do not like the\nidea of being dragged into unhealthy\ncompetition.\nOur Constitution makers were\naware of these problems. Yet they\nopted for free competition in\nelections as the way to select our\nfuture leaders. They did so because\nthis system works better in the long\nrun. In an ideal world all political\nleaders know what is good for the\npeople and are motivated only by a\ndesire to serve them. Political\ncompetition is not necessary in such\nan ideal world. But that is not what\nhappens in real life. Political leaders\nall over the world, like all other\nprofessionals, are motivated by a\ndesire to advance their political\ncareers. They want to remain in\npower or get power and positions for\nthemselves.They may wish to serve\nthe people as well, but it is risky to\ndepend entirely on their sense of\nduty. Besides even when they wish\nto serve the people, they may not\nknow what is required to do so, or\ntheir ideas may not match what the\npeople really want.\nHow do we deal with this real life\nsituation? One way is to try and\nimprove the knowledge and character\nof political leaders. The other and\nmore realistic way is to  set up a\nsystem where political leaders are\nrewarded for serving the people and\npunished for not doing so. Who\ndecides this reward or punishment?\nThe simple answer is: the people.\nThis is what electoral competition\ndoes. Regular electoral competition\nprovides incentives to political\nparties and leaders. They know that\nif they raise issues that people want\nto be raised, their popularity and\nchances of victory will increase in\nthe next elections. But if they fail to\nsatisfy the voters with their work\nthey will not be able to win again.Ah! So, elections\nare like exams\nwhere politicians\nand parties know if\nthey have passed\nor failed.

Those who are influential and\nresourceful may prevent them from\nwinning elections. If that happens,\nour Parliament and Assemblies\nwould be deprived of the voice of a\nsignificant section of our population.\nThat would make our democracy less\nrepresentative and less democratic.\nSo, the makers of our Constitution\nthought of a special system of\nreserved constituencies for the\nweaker sections. Some constituencies\nare reserved for  people who belong\nto the Scheduled Castes [SC] and\nScheduled Tribes [ST]. In a SC\nreserved constituency only someone\nwho belongs to the Scheduled\nCastes can stand for election.\nSimilarly only those belonging to the\nScheduled Tribes can contest an\nelection from a constituency\nreserved for ST. Currently, in the\nLok Sabha, 84 seats are reserved for\nthe Scheduled Castes and 47 for the\nScheduled Tribes (as on  26 January\n2019). This number is in proportion\nto their share in the total population.\nThus the reserved seats for SC and\nST do not take away the legitimate\nshare of any other social group.\nThis system of reservation\nwas extended later to other\nweaker sections at the district and\nlocal level. In many states, seats\nin rural (panchayat) and urban\n(municipalities and corporations)local bodies are now reserved for\nOther Backward Classes (OBC) as\nwell. However, the proportion of\nseats reserved varies from state to\nstate. Similarly, one-third of the\nseats are reserved in rural and\nurban local bodies for women\ncandidates.\nV VV VVot otot ototers ersers ersers’ ’’ ’’ list  list list  list list\nOnce the constituencies are decided,\nthe next step is to decide who can\nand who cannot vote.

This\nlist is officially called the Electoral\nRoll and is commonly known as the\nVoters’ List.\nThis is an important step for it is\nlinked to the first condition of a\ndemocratic election: everyone\nshould get an equal opportunity to\nchoose representatives. Earlier, we\nread about the principle of\nuniversal adult franchise. In\npractice it means that everyone\nshould have one vote and each vote\nshould have equal value.

They have to work\nwith and within institutions. This chapter is about the working of such\ninstitutions in a democracy. We try to understand this by looking at the\nmanner in which major decisions are taken and implemented in our\ncountry. We also look at how disputes regarding these decisions are\nresolved. In this process we come across three institutions that play a key\nrole in major decisions – legislature, executive and judiciary.\nYou have already read something about these institutions in earlier\nclasses. Here we shall quickly summarise those and move on to asking\nlarger questions. In the case of each institution we ask: What does this\ninstitution do? How is this institution connected to other institutions?\nWhat makes its functioning more or less democratic? The basic objective\nhere is to understand how all these institutions together carry on the\nwork of government. Sometimes we compare these with similar institutions\nin other democracies. In this chapter we take our examples from the\nworking of the national level government called Central Government, Union\nGovernment, or just Government of India. While reading this chapter, you\ncan think of and discuss examples from the working of the government in\nyour state.CHAPTER 4\nWorking o f\nInstituti ons\n2024-25"

The Government of India had\nappointed the Second Backward\nClasses Commission in 1979. It was\nheaded by B.P. Mandal. Hence it was\npopularly called the Mandal\nCommission. It was asked to\ndetermine the criteria to identify the\nsocially and educationally backward\nclasses in India and recommend\nsteps to be taken for their\nadvancement. The Commission gave\nits Report in 1980 and made many\nrecommendations. One of these  was\nthat 27 per cent of government jobs\nbe reserved for the socially and\neducationally backward classes.\nThe Report and recommendations\nwere discussed in the Parliament.\nFor several years, many\nparliamentarians and parties kept\ndemanding the implementation of\nthe Commission’s recommendations.\nThen came the  Lok Sabha election\nof 1989. In its election manifesto,\nthe Janata Dal promised that if voted\nto power, it would implement the\nMandal Commission report. The\nJanata Dal did form the government\nafter this election.

Governing a\ncountry involves various such\nactivities. For example, the\ngovernment is responsible for\nensuring security to the citizens and\nproviding facilities for educ ation\nand health to all. It collects taxes\nand spends the money thus raised\non admi nistration, defence and\ndevelopm ent programmes. It\nformulates and implements several\nwelfare sche mes. Some persons have\nto take decisions on how to go about\nthese activities. Others have to\nimplement these decisions. If\ndisputes arise on these decisions or\nin their implementati on, there should\nbe someone to determine what is\nright and what is wrong. It is\nimportant that everyone should\nknow who is responsible for doing\nwhat. It is also important that these\nactivities keep taking place even if\nthe persons in key positions change.\nSo, to attend to all these tasks,\nseveral arrangements are made in\nall modern democracies. Such\narrangements are called institutions.\nA democracy works well wh en these\ninstitutions perform  functions\nassigned to them. The Constitution\nof any country lays down basic\nrules on the powers and functionsof each institution.

Institutions involve\nmeetings, committees and routines.\nThis often leads to delays and\ncomplications. Therefore dealing\nwith institutions can be frustrating.\nOne might feel that it is much better\nto have one person take all decisions\nwithout any rules, procedures and\nmeetings. But that is not the spirit\nof democracy. Some of the delays\nand complications introduced by\ninstitutions are very useful.

One House is usually\ndirectly elected by the people and\nexercises the real power on behalf\nof the people. The second House is\nusually elected indirectly and\nperforms some special functions.\nThe most common work for the\nsecond House is to look after the\ninterests of various states, regions\nor federal units.\nIn our country, Parliament\nconsists of two Houses. The two\nHouses are known as the Council of\nStates (Rajya Sabha) and the House\nof the People (Lok Sabha). The\nPresident of India is a part of\nParliament, although she is not a\nmember of either House. That is why\nall laws made in the Houses come\ninto force only after they receive the\nassent of the President.\nYou have read about the Indian\nParliament in earlier classes. From\nthe Chapter 3 you know how Lok\nSabha elections take place. Let us\nrecall some key differences between\nthe composition of these two Houses\nof Parliament. Answer the following\nfor the Lok Sabha and the Rajya\nSabha:\n/UIstopWhat is the total number of\nmembers? …\n/UIstopWho elects the members? …\n/UIstopWhat is the length of the term (in\nyears)? …\n/UIstopCan the House be dissolved or is\nit permanent? …What is the point in\nhaving so much\ndebate and\ndiscussion in the\nParliament when\nwe know that the\nview of the ruling\nparty is going to\nprevail?Which of the two Houses is more\npowerful? It might appear that the\nRajya Sabha is more powerful, for\nsometimes it is called the ‘Upper\nChamber’ and the Lok Sabha the\n‘Lower Chamber’. But this does not\nmean that Rajya Sabha is more\npowerful than Lok Sabha. This is\njust an old style of speaking and not\nthe language used in our\nConstitution.\nOur Constitution does give the\nRajya Sabha some special powers\nover the states. But on most matters,\nthe Lok Sabha exercises supreme\npower. Let us see how:\n1Any ordinary law needs to be\npassed by both the Houses. But if\nthere is a difference between the\ntwo Houses, the final decision is\ntaken in a joint session in which\nmembers of both the Houses sit\ntogether. Because of the larger\nnumber of members, the view of\nthe Lok Sabha is likely to prevail\nin such a meeting.\n2Lok Sabha exercises more powers\nin money matters. Once the Lok\nSabha passes the budget of the\ngovernment or any other money\nrelated law, the Rajya Sabha\ncannot reject it. The Rajya Sabha\ncan only delay it by 14 days or\nsuggest changes in it. The Lok\nSabha may or may not accept\nthese changes.\nACTIVITY\nWhen Parliament is in session, there is a special\nprogramme everyday on Doordarshan about the\nproceedings in Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha.

Political leaders\nwho take the big decisions fall in this\ncategory. In the second category,\npeople are  appointed on a long-term\nbasis. This is called the permanent\nexecutive or civil services.

This could easily\nhappen in ministries like Defence,\nIndustry, Health, Science and\nTechnology, Mines, etc. Why should\nthe minister have the final say on\nthese matters?\nThe reason is very simple.

She is\nfinally answerable to the people for\nall the consequences of her\ndecision. That is why the minister\ntakes all the final decisions.

Yet there is no direct\nelection to the post of the Prime\nMinister. The President appoints the\nPrime Minister. But the President\ncannot appoint anyone she likes.\nThe President appoints the leader\nof the majority party or the coalition\nof parties that commands a majority\nin the Lok Sabha, as Prime Minister.\nIn case no single party or alliance\ngets a majority, the President\nappoints the person most likely to\nsecure a majority support. The\nPrime Minister does not have a fixed\ntenure. He continues in power so\nlong as he remains the leader of the\nmajority party or coalition.After the appointment of the Prime\nMinister, the President appoints\nother ministers on the advice of the\nPrime Minister. The Ministers are\nusually from the party or the\ncoalition that has the majority in the\nLok Sabha. The Prime Minister is\nfree to choose ministers, as long as\nthey are members of Parliament.\nSometimes, a person who is not a\nmember of Parliament can also\nbecome a minister. But such a\nperson has to get elected to one of\nthe Houses of Parliament within six\nmonths of appointment as minister.\nCouncil of Ministers is the official\nname for the body that includes all\nthe Ministers. It usually has 60 to\n80 Ministers of different ranks.\n/UIstopCabinet Ministers  are usually top-\nlevel leaders of the ruling party or\nparties who are in charge of the\nmajor ministries. Usually the\nCabinet Ministers meet to take\ndecisions in the name of the\nCouncil of Ministers. Cabinet is\nthus the inner ring of the Council\nof Ministers. It comprises about 25\nministers.\n/UIstopMinisters of State with indepen-\ndent charge  are usually in-charge\nof smaller Ministries. They\nparticipate in the Cabinet meet-\nings only when specially invited.\n/UIstopMinisters of State  are attached to\nand required to assist Cabinet\nMinisters.\nSince it is not practical for all\nministers to meet regularly and\ndiscuss everything, the decisions are\ntaken in Cabinet meetings. That is\nwhy parliamentary democracy in\nmost countries is often known as the\nCabinet form of government. The\nCabinet works as a team. The\nministers may have different views\nand opinions, but everyone has to own\nup to every decision of the Cabinet.\nWORKIN G OF INSTITUTI ONSThe race to become\nminister is not new .\nHere is a car toon\ndepicting ministerial\naspirants waiting to\nget a ber th in Nehr u’s\nCabinet af ter the\n1962 elections.

His decisions are final\nin case disagreements arise between\nDepartments. He exercises general\nsupervision of different ministries.\nAll ministers work under his\nleadership. The Prime Minister\ndistributes and redistributes work\nto the ministers. He also has the\npower to dismiss ministers.

The\npowers of the Prime Minister in all\nparliamentary democracies of the\nworld have increased so much in\nrecent decades that parliamentary\ndemocracies are some times seen as\nPrime Ministerial form of\ngovernment. As political parties have\ncome to play a major role in politics,\nthe Prime Minister controls the\nCabinet and Parliament through the\nparty.

The\nPresident is the supreme\ncommander of the defence forces of\nIndia.\nBut we should remember that the\nPresident exercises all these powers\nonly on the advice of the Council of\nMinisters. The President can ask the\nCouncil of Ministers to reconsider its\nadvice. But if the same advice is\ngiven again, she is bound to act\naccording to it. Similarly, a bill\npassed by the Parliament becomes\na law only after the President gives\nassent to it. If the President wants,\nshe can delay this for some time and\nsend the bill back to Parliament for\nreconsideration. But if Parliament\npasses the bill again, she has to\nsign it.\nSo you may wonder what does the\nPresident really do? Can she do\nanything on her own at all? There is\none very important thing she should\ndo on her own: appoint the Prime\nMinister.

In many\ncountries of the world, the President is both the\nhead of the state and the head of the government.\nThe President of the United States of America is\nthe most well known example of this kind of Presi-\ndent. The US President is directly elected by the\npeople. He personally chooses and appoints all\nMinisters. The law making is still done by the leg-\nislature (called the Congress in the US), but the\npresident can veto any law . Most impor tantly , the\npresident does not need the suppor t of the major -\nity of members in the Congress and neither is he\nanswerable to them. He has a fixed tenure of four\nyears and completes it even if his par ty does not\nhave a majority in the Congress.\nThis model is followed in most of the countries\nof Latin America and many of the ex-Soviet Union\ncountries. Given the centrality of the President,\nthis system of government is called the Presiden-\ntial form of government.

All the\ncourts at different levels in a country\nput together are called the judiciary.\nThe Indian judiciary consists of a\nSupreme Court for the entire nation,\nHigh Courts in the states, District\nCourts and the courts at local level.\nIndia has an integrated judiciary.

In Chapter 4 we learnt that a democracy must be based on\ninstitutions that follow certain rules and procedures. These elements are\nnecessary but not sufficient for a democracy. Elections and institutions\nneed to be combined with a third element – enjoyment of rights – to make\na government democratic. Even the most properly elected rulers working\nthrough the established institutional process must learn not to cross some\nlimits. Citizens’ democratic rights set those limits in a democracy.\nThis is what we take up in this final chapter of the book. We begin by\ndiscussing some real life cases to imagine what it means to live without\nrights. This leads to a discussion on what we mean by rights and why do\nwe need them. As in the previous chapters, the general discussion is\nfollowed by a focus on India. We discuss one by one the Fundamental\nRights in the Indian Constitution.

In this\nprovince the population was\noverwhelmingly ethnic Albanian.\nBut in the entire country, Serbs\nwere in majority. A narrow minded\nSerb nationalist Milosevic\n(pronounced Miloshevich) had won\nthe election. His government was\nvery hostile to the Kosovo\nAlbanians. He wanted the Serbs to\ndominate the country. Many Serb\nleaders thought that Ethnic\nminorities like Albanians should\neither leave the country or accept\nthe dominance of the Serbs.\nThis is what happened to an\nAlbanian family in a town in Kosovo\nin April 1999:\n“74-year-old Batisha Hoxha was\nsitting in her kitchen with her 77-\nyear–old husband, Izet, staying\nwarm by the stove. They had heard\nexplosions but did not realise that\nSerbian troops had already entered\nthe town.

With her\nhusband dying before her, the\nsoldiers pulled the wedding ring off\nher finger and told her to get out.  “I\nwas not even outside the gate when they\nburned the house ” … She was standing\non the street in the rain with no\nhouse, no husband, no possessions\nbut the clothes she was wearing.”\nThis news report was typical of\nwhat happened to thousands of\nAlbanians in that period.

For this we\nexpect others to behave in such a\nway that does not harm us or hurt\nus. Equally, our actions should not\nalso harm or hurt others. So a right\nis possible when you make a claim\nthat is equally possible for others.\nYou cannot have a right that harms\nor hurts others. You cannot have a\nright to play a game in such a way\nthat it breaks the neighbour’s\nwindow. The Serbs in Yugoslavia\ncould not have claimed the whole\ncountry for themselves. The claims\nwe make should be reasonable.\nThey should be such that can be\nmade available to others in an equal\nmeasure. Thus, a right comes with\nan obligation to respect other rights.\nJust because we claim some thing\nit does not become our right. It has\nto be recognised by the society we\nlive in. Rights acquire meaning only\nin society. Every society makes\ncertain rules to regulate our\nconduct. They tell us what is right\nand what is wrong. What is\nrecognised by the society as rightful\nbecomes the basis of rights. That is\nwhy the notion of rights changes\nfrom time to time and society to\nsociety. Two hundred years ago\nanyone who said that women should\nhave right to vote would have\nsounded strange. Today not granting\nthem vote in Saudi Arabia appears\nstrange.\nWhen the socially recognised\nclaims are written into law they\nacquire real force. Otherwise they\nremain merely as natural or moral\nrights. The prisoners in\nGuantanamo Bay had a moral claim\nnot to be tortured or humiliated. But\nthey could not go to anyone to\nenforce this claim. When law\nrecognises some claims they becomeenforceable. We can then demand\ntheir application. When fellow\ncitizens or the government do not\nrespect these rights we call it\nviolation or infringement of our\nrights. In such circumstances\ncitizens can approach courts to\nprotect their rights. So, if we want\nto call any claim a right, it has to\nhave these three qualities.

Some\nmay not believe in any religion.\nSecularism is based on the idea that\nthe state is concerned only with\nrelations among human beings, and\nnot with the relation between human\nbeings and God. A secular state is one\nthat does not establish any one\nreligion as official religion. Indian\nsecularism practices an attitude of a\nprincipled and equal distance from\nall religions.

Of course, a person is free\nto change religion on his or her own\nwill. Freedom to practice religion\ndoes not mean that a person can do\nwhatever he wants in the name ofreligion. For example, one cannot\nsacrifice animals or human beings\nas offerings to supernatural forces\nor gods. Religious practices which\ntreat women as inferior or those that\ninfringe women’s freedom are not\nallowed. For example, one cannot\nforce a widow to shave head or wear\nwhite clothes.\nA secular state is one that does not\nconfer any privilege or favour on any\nparticular religion. Nor does it pun-\nish or discriminate against people\non the basis of religion they follow.\nThus the government cannot com-\npel any person to pay any taxes for\nthe promotion or maintenance of\nany particular religion or religious\ninstitution.

We have already seen in\nChapter 4 that the judiciary in our\ncountry is independent of the\ngovernment and the parliament. We\nalso noted that our judiciary is very\npowerful and can do whatever is\nneeded to protect the rights of the\ncitizens.\nIn case of any violation of a\nFundamental Right the aggrieved\nperson can go to a court for remedy.\nBut now, any person can go to court\nagainst the violation of the\nFundamental Right, if it is of social\nor public interest. It is called Public\nInterest Litigation (PIL). Under thePIL any citizen or group of citizens\ncan approach the Supreme Court or\na High Court for the protection of\npublic interest against a particular\nlaw or action of the government. One\ncan write to the judges even on a\npostcard. The court will take up the\nmatter if the judges find it in public\ninterest.\nACTIVITY\nIs there a State Human Rights Commission in\nyour state?

                "text": "875.4EXPAND ING SCO PE OF RIGHTS\nWe began this chapter by discussing\nthe significance of rights. In much\nof the chapter we have focussed only\non Fundamental Rights in the\nConstitution. You might think that\nFundamental Rights granted by the\nConstitution are the only rights\ncitizen have. This is not true. While\nFundamental Rights are the source\nof all rights, our Constitution and\nlaw offers a wider range of rights.\nOver the years the scope of rights\nhas expanded.\nSometimes it leads to expansion\nin the legal rights that the citizen can\nenjoy. From time to time, the courts\ngave judgments to expand the scope\nof rights. Certain rights like right to\nfreedom of press, right to\ninformation, and right to education\nare derived from the Fundamental\nRights. Now school education has\nbecome a right for Indian citizens.\nThe governments are responsible for\nproviding free and compulsory\neducation to all children up to the\nage of 14 years. Parliament has\nenacted a law giving the right to\ninformation to the citizens. This Act\nwas made under the Fundamental\nRight to freedom of thought and\nexpression. We have a right to seek\ninformation from government\noffices. Recently the Supreme Court\nhas expanded the meaning of the\nright to life to include the right to\nfood. Also, rights are not limited only\nto Fundamental Rights asenumerated in the Constitution.\nConstitution provides many more\nrights, which may not be Fundamental\nRights. For example the right to\nproperty is not a Fundamental Right\nbut it is a constitutional right. Right to\nvote in elections is an important\nconstitutional right.\nSometimes the expansion takes\nplace in what is called human rights.\nThese are universal moral claims that\nmay or may not have been recognised\nby law. In that sense these claims are\nnot rights going by the definition that\nwe presented earlier. With the\nexpansion of democracy all over the\nworld, there is greater pressure on\ngovernments to accept these claims.\nSome international covenants  have\nalso contributed to the expansion of\nrights.\nThus the scope of rights has been\nexpanding and new rights are\nevolving over time. They are result\nof struggle of the people. New rights\nemerge as societies develop or as\nnew constitutions are made. The\nConstitution of South Africa guarantees\nits citizens several kinds of new rights:\n<Right to privacy, so that citizens\nor their home cannot be searched,\ntheir phones cannot be tapped,\ntheir communication cannot be\nopened.\n<Right to an environment that is not\nharmful to their health or well-\nbeing;\n<Right to have access to adequate\nhousing.\nDEMOCRA TIC RIGHTS\nAre these rights\nonly for adults?\nWhich of these\nrights are available\nto children?\n2024-25"
