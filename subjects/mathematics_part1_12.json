It may\nbe very hard to define mathematical beauty but that is just as true of\nbeauty of any kind, we may not know quite what we mean by a\nbeautiful poem, but that does not prevent us from recognising\none when we read it. — G. H. HARDY  v\n1.1  Introduction\nRecall that the notion of relations and functions, domain,\nco-domain and range have been introduced in Class XI\nalong with different types of specific real valued functions\nand their graphs. The concept of the term ‘relation’ in\nmathematics has been drawn from the meaning of relation\nin English language, according to which two objects or\nquantities are related if there is a recognisable connection\nor link between the two objects or quantities. Let  A be\nthe set of students of Class XII of a school and B be the\nset of students of Class XI of the same school. Then some\nof the examples of relations from A to B are\n(i){(a, b) ∈A × B: a is brother of b},\n(ii) {(a, b) ∈A × B: \na is sister of b},\n(iii) {(a, b) ∈A × B: age of a is greater than age of b},\n(iv) {(a, b) ∈A × B: total marks obtained by a in the  final examination is less than\nthe total marks obtained by b in the final examination},\n(v) {(a, b) ∈ A × B: a lives in the same locality as b}.  However , abstracting from\nthis, we define mathematically a relation R from A to B as an arbitrary subset\nof A × B.\nIf (a, b) ∈ R, we say that a is related to b under the relation R and we write as\na R b. In general, ( a, b) ∈ R, we do not bother whether there is a recognisable\nconnection or link between a and b. As seen in Class XI, functions are special kind of\nrelations.\nIn this chapter , we will study dif ferent types of relations and functions, composition\nof functions, invertible functions and bin ary operations.Chapter 1\nRELA TIONS AND FUNCTIONS\nLejeune Dirichlet\n (1805-1859)\nReprint 2024-25"

Thus, the empty set φ and A × A are two\nextreme relations. For illustration, consider a relation R in the set A = {1, 2, 3, 4}  given by\nR = {( a, b): a – \nb = 10}. This is the empty set, as no pair ( a, b) satisfies the condition\na – b = 10. Similarly , R′ = {( a, b) : | a – b | ≥ 0} is the whole set A × A, as all pairs\n(a, b) in A × A satisfy | a – b | ≥ 0. These two extreme examples lead us to the\nfollowing definitions.\nDefinition 1 A  relation R in a set A is called empty r elation, if no element of A is\nrelated to any element of A, i.e., R = φ ⊂ A  × A.\nDefinition 2  A relation R in a set A is called universal r elation , if each element of A\nis related to every element of A, i.e., R = A × A.\nBoth the empty relation and the universal relation are some times called trivial\nrelations .\nExample 1  Let A be the set of all students of a boys school. Show that the relation R\nin A given by R = {( a, b) : a is sister of b} is the empty relation and R ′ = {( a, b) : the\ndifference between heights of a and b is less than 3 meters} is the universal relation.\nSolution\n Since the school is boys school, no student of the school can be sister of any\nstudent of the school. Hence, R = φ, showing that R is the empty relation. It is also\nobvious that the difference between heights of any two students of the school has to be\nless than 3 meters. This shows that R ′ = A × A is the universal relation.\nRemark  In Class XI, we have seen two ways of representing a relation, namely raster\nmethod and set builder method. However , a relation R in the set {1, 2, 3, 4}  defined by R\n= {( a, b) : b = a + 1} is also expressed as a R b if and only if\nb = a + 1 by many authors. We may also use this notation, as and when convenient.\nIf (a, b) ∈ R, we say that a is related to b and we denote it as a R b.\nOne of the most important relation, which plays a significant role in Mathematics,\nis an  equivalence r elation . To study equivalence relation, we first consider three\ntypes of relations, namely reflexive, symmetric and transitive.\nDefinition 3  A relation R in a set A is called\n(i)reflexive , if (a, a) ∈ R, for every a ∈ A,\n(ii) symmetric , if (a1, a2) ∈ R implies that ( a2, a1) ∈ R, for all a1, a2 ∈ A.\n(iii) transitive , if (a1, a2) ∈ R and ( a2, a3) ∈ R implies that ( a1, a3) ∈ R, for all a1, a2,\na3 ∈ A.\nReprint 2024-25"

Show that R is an equivalence relation.\nSolution  R is reflexive, since every triangle is congruent to itself. Further ,\n(T1, T2) ∈ R ⇒ T1 is congruent to T2 ⇒ T2 is congruent to T1 ⇒ (T2, T1) ∈ R. Hence,\nR is symmetric. Moreover , (T1, T2), (T2, T3) ∈ R ⇒ \nT1 is  congruent to T2 and T2 is\ncongruent to T3 ⇒ T1 is congruent to T3 ⇒ (T1, T3) ∈ R. Therefore, R is an equivalence\nrelation.\nExample 3 Let L be the set of all lines in a plane and R be the relation in L defined as\nR = {(L1, L2) : L1 is perpendicular to L2}. Show that R is symmetric but neither\nreflexive nor transitive.\nSolution  R is not reflexive, as a line L1 can not be perpendicular to itself, i.e., (L1, L1)\n∉ R. R is symmetric as (L1, L2) ∈ R\n⇒ L1 is perpendicular to L2\n⇒ L2 is perpendicular to L1\n⇒ (L2, L1) ∈ R.\nR is not transitive . Indeed, if L1 is perpendicular to L2 and\nL2 is perpendicular to L3, then L1 can never be perpendicular to\nL3. In fact, L1 is parallel to L3, i.e., (L1, L2) ∈ R, (L2, L3) ∈ R but (L1, L3) ∉ R.\nExample 4  Show that the relation R in the set {1, 2, 3} given by R = {(1, 1), (2, 2),\n(3, 3), (1, 2), (2, 3)} is reflexive but neither symmetric nor transitive.\nSolution\n R is reflexive, since (1, 1), (2, 2) and (3, 3) lie in R. Also, R is not symmetric,\nas (1, 2) ∈ R but (2, 1) ∉ R. Similarly , R is not transitive, as (1, 2) ∈ R and (2, 3) ∈ R\nbut (1, 3) ∉ R.\nExample 5  Show that the relation R in the set Z of integers given by\nR = {( a, b) : 2 divides a – b}\nis an equivalence relation.\nSolution R is reflexive, as 2 divides ( a – a) for all a ∈ Z. Further , if (a, b) ∈ R, then\n2 divides a – b. Therefore, 2 divides b – a. Hence, (b , a) ∈ R, which shows that R is\nsymmetric. Similarly , if (a, b) ∈ R and ( b, c) ∈ R, then a – b and b – c are divisible by\n2. Now , a – c = (a – b) + (b – c) is even (Why?). So, ( a – c) is divisible by 2. This\nshows that R is transitive. Thus, R is an equivalence relation in Z.Fig 1.1\nReprint 2024-25"

Infact, what we have seen above is true\nfor an arbitrary equivalence relation R in a set X. Given an arbitrary equivalence\nrelation R in an arbitrary set X, R divides X into mutually disjoint subsets Ai called\npartitions or subdivisions  of X satisfying:\n(i)all elements of Ai are related to each other , for all i.\n(ii) no element of Ai is related to any element of Aj, i ≠ j.\n(iii) ∪ Aj = X and Ai ∩ Aj = φ, i ≠ j.\nThe subsets Ai are called equivalence classes .

Following the\narguments similar to those used in Example 5, we can show that R is an equivalence\nrelation. Also, A1 coincides with the set of all integers in Z which are related to zero, A2\ncoincides with the set of all integers which are related to 1 and A3 coincides with the\nset of all integers in Z which are related to 2. Thus, A1 = [0], A2 = [1] and A3 = [2].\nIn fact, A1 = [3 r], A2 = [3 r + 1] and A3 = [3 r + 2], for all r  ∈ Z.\nExample 6  Let R be the relation defined in the set A = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7} by\nR = {( a, b) : both a and b are either odd or even}.

As the concept of function is of paramount importance in mathematics and\namong other  disciplines as well, we would like to extend our study about function from\nwhere we finished earlier . In this section, we would like to study dif ferent types of\nfunctions.\nConsider the functions  f1, f2, f3 and f4 given by the following diagrams.\nIn Fig 1.2, we observe that the images of distinct elements of X1 under the function\nf1 are distinct, but the image of two distinct elements 1 and 2 of X1 under f2 is same,\nnamely b. Further , there are some elements like e and f in X2 which are not images of\nany element of X1 under f1, while all elements of X3 are images of some elements of X1\nunder f3. The above observations lead to the following definitions:\nDefinition 5  A function f : X →  Y is defined to be one-one  (or injective ), if the images\nof distinct elements of X under f are distinct, i.e., for every x1, x2 ∈ X, f(x1) = f(x2)\nimplies x1 = x2. Otherwise, f is called many-one .\nThe function f1 and f4 in Fig 1.2 (i) and (iv) are one-one and the function f2 and f3\nin Fig 1.2 (ii) and (iii) are many-one.\nDefinition 6  A function f : X → Y is said to be onto (or surjective ), if every element\nof Y is the image of some element of X under f, i.e., for every y ∈ Y, there exists an\nelement x in X such that f(x) = y.\nThe function f3 and f4 in Fig 1.2 (iii), (iv) are onto and the function f1 in Fig 1.2 (i) is\nnot onto as elements e, f in X2 are not the image of any element in X1 under f1.\nReprint 2024-25"

Further ,\n(a, b) ∈ R1 ∩ R2 ⇒ (a, b) ∈ R1 and (a, b) ∈ R2 ⇒ (b, a) ∈ R1 and (b, a) ∈ R2 ⇒\n(b, a) ∈ R1 ∩ R2, hence, R1 ∩ R2 is symmetric.

Thus, R1 ∩ R2 is an equiva lence relation.\nExample 19  Let R be a relation on the set A of ordered pairs of positive integers\ndefined by ( x, y) R (u, v) if  and only if xv = yu. Show that R is an equivalence relation.\nSolution Clearly , (x, y) R ( x, y), ∀(x, y) ∈ A, since xy = yx. This shows that R is\nreflexive. Further , (x, y) R (u, v) ⇒ xv = yu ⇒ uy = vx and hence ( u, v) R (x, y). This\nshows that R is symmetric. Similarly , (x, y) R (u, v) and ( u, v) R (a, b) ⇒ xv = yu and\nub = va ⇒ a axv yuu u= ⇒ b axv yuv u=  ⇒ xb = ya and hence ( x, y) R (a , b). Thus, R\nis transitive. Thus, R is an equivalence relation.\nExample 20  Let X = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}.

Therefore, total number of one-one maps from {1, 2, 3} to itself is\nsame as total number of permutations on three symbols 1, 2, 3 which is 3! = 6.\nExample 23 Let A = {1, 2, 3}. Then show that  the number of relations containing (1, 2)\nand (2, 3) which are reflexive and transitive but not symmetric is three.\nSolution The smallest relation R1 containing (1, 2) and (2, 3) which is reflexive and\ntransitive but not symmetric is {(1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3), (1, 2), (2, 3), (1, 3)}. Now , if we add\nthe pair (2, 1) to R1 to get R2, then the relation R2 will be reflexive, transitive but not\nsymmetric. Similarly , we can obtain R3 by adding (3, 2) to R1 to get the desired relation.\nHowever , we can not add two pairs (2, 1), (3, 2) or single pair (3, 1) to R1 at a time, as\nby doing so, we will be forced to add the remaining pair in order to maintain transitivity\nand in the process, the relation will become symmetric also which is not required. Thus,\nthe total number of desired relations is three .\nExample 24  Show that the number of equivalence relation in the set {1, 2, 3} containing\n(1, 2) and (2, 1) is two.\nSolution The smallest equivalence relation R1 containing (1, 2) and (2, 1) is {(1, 1),\n(2, 2), (3, 3), (1, 2), (2, 1)}. Now we are left with only 4 pairs namely (2, 3), (3, 2),\n(1, 3) and (3, 1). If we add any one, say (2, 3) to R1, then for symmetry we must add\n(3, 2) also and now for transitivity we are forced to add (1, 3) and (3, 1). Thus, the only\nequivalence relation bigger than R1 is the universal relation. This shows that the total\nnumber of equivalence relations containing (1, 2) and (2, 1) is two.\nExample 25 Consider the identity function IN : N → N defined as IN (x) = x ∀x ∈ N.\nShow that although IN is onto but IN + IN : N → N defined as\n(IN + IN) (x) = IN (x) + IN (x) = x + x = 2x  is not onto.\nReprint 2024-25"

Descartes (1596-1650), who used the word ‘function’ in his manuscript\n“Geometrie ” in 1637 to mean some positive integral power xn of a variable x\nwhile studying geometrical curves like hyperbola, parabola and ellipse. James\nGregory (1636-1675) in his work “ Vera Cir culi et Hyperbolae Quadratura ”\n(1667) considered function as a quantity obtained from other quantities by\nsuccessive use of algebraic operations or by any other operations. Later G . W\n.\nLeibnitz (1646-1716) in his manuscript “ Methodus tangentium inversa, seu  de\nfunctionibus ” written in 1673 used the word ‘function’ to mean a quantity varying\nfrom point to point on a curve such as the coordinates of a point on the curve, the\nslope of the curve, the tangent and the normal to the curve at a point. However ,\nin his manuscript “ Historia ” (1714), Leibnitz used the word ‘function’ to mean\nquantities that depend on a variable. He was the first to use the phrase ‘function\nof x’. John Bernoulli (1667-1748) used the notation φ x for the first time in 1718 to\nindicate a function of x. But the general adoption of symbols like f, F, φ, ψ ... to\nrepresent functions was made by Leonhard Euler (1707-1783) in 1734 in the first\npart of his manuscript “ Analysis Infinitorium ”. Later on, Joeph Louis Lagrange\n(1736-1813) published his manuscripts “ Theorie des functions analytiques ” in\n1793, where he discussed  about analytic function and used the notion f(x), F(x),\nφ(x) etc. for dif ferent function of x. Subsequently , Lejeunne Dirichlet\n(1805-1859) gave the definition of function which was being used till the set\ntheoretic definition of function presently used, was given after set theory was\ndeveloped by Georg Cantor (1845-1918).

There are\nmany functions which are not one-one, onto or both and\nhence we can not talk of their inverses. In Class XI, we\nstudied that trigonometric functions are not one-one and\nonto over their natural domains and ranges and hence their\ninverses do not exist. In this chapter , we shall study about\nthe restrictions on domains and ranges of trigonometric\nfunctions which ensure the existence of their inverses and\nobserve their behaviour through graphical representations.\nBesides, some elementary properties will also be discussed.\nThe inverse trigonometric functions play an important\nrole in calculus for they serve to define many integrals.\nThe concepts of inverse trigonometric functions is also used in science and engineering.\n2.2  Basic Concepts\nIn Class XI, we have studied trigonometric functions, which are defined as follows:\nsine function, i.e., sine : R → [– 1, 1]\ncosine function, i.e., cos : R → [– 1, 1]\ntangent function, i.e., tan : R – { x : x = (2 n \n+ 1) 2π, n ∈ Z} → R\ncotangent function, i.e., cot : R – { x : x = nπ, n ∈ Z} → R\nsecant function, i.e., sec : R – { x : x = (2 n + 1) 2π, n ∈ Z} → R – (– 1, 1)\ncosecant function, i.e., cosec : R – { x : x = nπ,  n ∈ Z} → R – (– 1, 1)Chapter 2\nINVERSE TRIGONOMETRIC\nFUNCTIONS\nAryabhata\n (476-550 A.

Here, the domain of g = range of f and the range of g =  domain\nof f. The function g is called the inverse of f and is denoted by f–1. Further , g is also\none-one and onto and inverse of g is f. Thus, g–1 = (f –1)–1 = f. We also have\n(f –1 o f ) ( x) = f –1 (f (x)) = f –1(y) = x\nand (f o f –1) (y) = f (f –1(y))  = f(x) = y\nSince the domain of sine function is the set of all real numbers and range is the\nclosed interval [–1, 1].

We can,\ntherefore, define the inverse of sine function in each of these intervals. We denote the\ninverse of sine function by sin–1 (arc sine function). Thus, sin–1 is a function whose\ndomain is [– 1, 1] and range could be any of the intervals 3,2 2− π −π \n  , ,2 2−π π \n   or\n3,2 2π π \n  , and so on.

In other words, if y = sin–1 x, then\nsin y = x.\nRemarks\n(i)We know from Chapter 1, that if y = f(x) is an invertible function, then  x = f –1 (y).\nThus, the graph of sin–1 function can be obtained from the graph of original\nfunction  by interchanging x and y axes, i.e., if ( a, b) is a point on the graph  of\nsine function, then ( b, a) becomes the corresponding point on the graph of inverse\nReprint 2024-25"

The ancient Indian\nMathematicians, Aryabhata (476A.D.), Brahmagupta (598 A.D.), Bhaskara I\n(600 A.D.) and Bhaskara II (1 114 A.D.) got important results of trigonometry . All\nthis knowledge went from India to Arabia and then from there to Europe. The\nGreeks had also started the study of trigonometry but their approach was so\nclumsy that when the Indian approach became known, it was immediately adopted\nthroughout the world.\nIn India, the predecessor of the modern trigonometric functions, known as\nthe sine of an angle, and the introduction of the sine function represents one of\nthe main contribution of the siddhantas (Sanskrit astronomical works) to\nmathematics.\nBhaskara I (about 600 A.D.) gave formulae to find the values of sine functions\nfor angles more than 90 °. A sixteenth century Malayalam work Yuktibhasa\ncontains a proof for the expansion of sin (A + B). Exact expression for sines or\ncosines of 18 °, 36°, 54°, 72°, etc., were given by Bhaskara II.\nThe symbols sin–1 x, cos–1 x, etc., for arc sin x, arc cos x, etc., were suggested\nby the astronomer Sir John F .W. Hersehel (1813) The name of Thales\n(about 600 B.C.) is invariably associated with height and distance problems. He\nis credited with the determination of the height of a great pyramid in Egypt by\nmeasuring shadows of the pyramid and an auxiliary staff (or gnomon) of known\nheight, and comparing the ratios:\nH\nSh\ns= = tan (sun’ s altitude)\nThales is also said to have calculated the distance of a ship at sea through\nthe proportionality of sides of similar triangles. Problems on height and distance\nusing the similarity property are also found in ancient Indian works.\n—v vv vv—\nReprint 2024-25"

Matrices\nare one of the most powerful tools in mathematics. This mathematical tool simplifies\nour work to a great extent when compared with other straight forward methods. The\nevolution of concept of matrices is the result of an attempt to obtain compact and\nsimple methods of solving system of linear equations. Matrices are not only used as a\nrepresentation of the coefficients in system of linear equations, but utility of matrices\nfar exceeds that use. Matrix notation and operations are used in electronic spreadsheet\nprograms for personal computer , which in turn is used in dif ferent areas of business\nand science like budgeting, sales projection, cost estimation, analysing the results of an\nexperiment etc. Also, many physical operations such as magnification, rotation and\nreflection through a plane can be represented mathematically by matrices. Matrices\nare also used in cryptography . This mathematical tool is not only used in certain branches\nof sciences, but also in genetics, economics, sociology , modern psychology and industrial\nmanagement.\nIn this chapter , we shall find it interesting to become acquainted with the\nfundamentals of matrix and matrix algebra.\n3.2 Matrix\nSuppose we wish to express the information that Radha has 15 notebooks.

The following are some examples of matrices:\n5 – 2\nA 0 5\n3 6 \n = \n  , 12 32\nB 3.5 –1 2\n53 57i + − \n = \n \n  ,  31 3Ccos tan sin 2x x\nx x x  += +  \nIn the ab ove examples, the horizontal lines of elements are said to constitute, rows\nof the matrix and the vertical lines of elements are said to constitute, columns  of the\nmatrix. Thus A has 3 rows and 2 columns, B has 3 rows and 3 columns while C has 2\nrows and 3 columns.\n3.2.1   Order of a matrix\nA matrix having m rows and n columns is called a matrix of order m × n or simply m × n\nmatrix (read as an m by n matrix). So referring to the above examples of matrices, we\nhave A as 3 × 2 matrix, B as 3 × 3 matrix and C as 2 × 3 matrix.  We observe that A has\n3 × 2 = 6 elements, B and C have 9 and 6 elements, respectively .\nIn general, an m × n matrix has the following rectangular array:\norA = [ aij]m × n, 1≤ i ≤ m, 1≤ j ≤ n   i, j ∈ N\nThus the ith  row consists of the elements ai1, ai2, ai3,..., ain, while the jth column\nconsists of the elements a1j, a2j, a3j,..., amj,\nIn general aij, is an element lying in the ith row and jth column. We can also call\nit as the ( i, j)th element of A. The number of elements in an m × n matrix will be\nequal to mn.\nReprint 2024-25"

Let A = [aij] be an m × n matrix and B = [ bjk] be an\nn × p matrix. Then the product of the matrices A and B is the matrix C of order m × p.\nTo get the ( i, k)th element cik of the matrix C, we take the ith row of A and kth column\nof B, multiply them elementwise and take the sum of all these products. In other words ,\nif A = [aij]m × n, B = [bjk]n × p, then the ith row of A is [ai1 ai2 ... ain] and the kth column of\nB is 1\n2\n.\n.\n.k\nk\nnkb\nb\nb \n \n \n \n \n   , then cik =  ai1 b1k + ai2 b2k + ai3 b3k + ... + ain bnk = \n1n\nij jk\nja b\n=∑ .\nThe matrix C = [ cik]m × p is the product of A and B.\nFor example, if 1 1 2C0 3 4− =   and 2 7\n1 D 1\n5 4 \n = − \n  −   , then the product CD is defined\nReprint 2024-25"

The arrangement of rods was precisely\nthat of the numbers in a determinant. The Chinese, therefore, early developed the\nidea of subtracting columns and rows as in simplification of a determinant\nMikami, China, pp 30, 93.\nSeki Kowa, the greatest of the Japanese Mathematicians of seventeenth\ncentury in his work ‘ Kai Fukudai no Ho ’ in 1683 showed that he had the idea of\ndeterminants and of their expansion. But he used this device only in eliminating a\nquantity from two equations and not directly in the solution of a set of simultaneous\nlinear equations. T. Hayashi, “ The Fakudoi and Determinants in Japanese\nMathematics ,” in the proc. of the Tokyo Math. Soc., V\n.\nVendermonde was the first to recognise determinants as independent functions.\nHe may be called the formal founder . Laplace (1772), gave general method of\nexpanding a determinant in terms of its complementary minors. In 1773 Lagrange\ntreated determinants of the second and third orders and used them for purpose\nother than the solution of equations. In 1801, Gauss used determinants in his\ntheory of numbers.\nThe next great contributor was Jacques - Philippe - Marie Binet, (1812) who\nstated the theorem relating to the product of two matrices of m-columns and n-\nrows, which for the special case of m = n reduces to the multiplication theorem.\nAlso on the same day , Cauchy (1812) presented one on the same subject. He\nused the word ‘determinant’ in its present sense. He gave the proof of multiplication\ntheorem more satisfactory than Binet’ s.\nThe greatest contributor to the theory was Carl Gustav Jacob Jacobi, after\nthis the word determinant received its final acceptance.\nReprint 2024-25"

We had learnt to\ndifferentiate certain functions like polynomial functions and\ntrigonometric functions. In this chapter , we introduce the\nvery important concepts of continuity , differentiability and\nrelations between them. We will also learn dif ferentiation\nof inverse trigonometric functions. Further , we introduce a\nnew class of functions called exponential and logarithmic\nfunctions. These functions lead to powerful techniques of\ndifferentiation. We illustrate certain geometrically obvious\nconditions through differential calculus. In the process, we\nwill learn some fundamental theorems in this  area.\n5.2  Continuity\nWe start the section with two informal examples to get a feel of continuity .

In\nparticular the left and right hand limits do not coincide. We also observe that the value\nof the function at x = 0 concides with the left hand limit. Note that when we try to draw\nthe graph, we cannot draw it in one stroke, i.e., without lifting pen from the plane of the\npaper , we can not draw the graph of this function. In fact, we need to lift the pen when\nwe come to 0 from left.

Recall that\nif the right hand and left hand limits at x = c coincide, then we say that the common\nvalue is the limit of the function at x = c. Hence we may also rephrase  the definition of\ncontinuity as follows: a function is continuous at x = c if the function is defined at\nx = c and if the value of the function at x = c equals the limit of the function at\nx = c. If f is not continuous at c, we say f is discontinuous at c and c is called a point\nof discontinuity of f.Fig 5.2\nReprint 2024-25"

The domain of f is all real numbers except\npoints at which q  is zero. Since polynomial functions are continuous (Example 14), f is\ncontinuous by (4) of  Theorem 1.\nExample 17  Discuss the continuity of sine function.\nSolution  To see this we use the following facts\n0lim sin 0\nxx\n→=\nWe have not proved it, but is intuitively clear from the graph of sin x near 0.\nNow , observe that f(x) = sin x is defined for every real number .

This is defined for all real numbers such\nthat cos x ≠ 0, i.e., x ≠ (2n +1)2π. We have just proved that both sine and cosine\nfunctions are continuous. Thus tan x being a quotient of two continuous functions is\ncontinuous wherever it is defined.\nAn interesting fact is the behaviour of continuous functions with respect to\ncomposition of functions. Recall that if f and g are two real functions, then\n(f o g) (x) = f(g(x))\nis defined whenever the range of g is a subset of domain of f. The following theorem\n(stated without proof) captures the continuity of composite functions.\nTheorem 2  Suppose \nf and g are real valued functions such that ( f o g) is defined at c.\nIf g is continuous at c and if f  is continuous at g(c), then ( f o g) is continuous at c.\nThe following examples illustrate this theorem.\nExample 19 Show that the function defined by f(x) = sin (x2) is a continuous function.\nSolution  Observe that the function is defined for every real number . The function\nf may be thought of as a composition g o h of the two functions g and h, where\ng(x) = sin x  and h(x) = x2. Since both g and h  are continuous functions, by Theorem 2,\nit can be deduced that f is a continuous function.\nExample 20 Show that the function f defined by\nf(x) =|1 – x  + |x||,\nwhere x  is any real number , is a continuous function.\nSolution  Define g  by g (x) = 1 – x + |x| and  h by h(x) = |x| for all real x. Then\n(h o g) (x) =h(g(x))\n=h(1– x  + |x|)\n=|1– x + |x|| = f(x)\nIn Example 7, we have seen that h is a continuous function. Hence g being a sum\nof a polynomial function and the modulus function is continuous. But then f  being a\ncomposite of two continuous functions is continuous.\nReprint 2024-25"

It needs to be emphasized that many statements made in this section are\nmotivational and precise proofs of these are well beyond the scope of this text.\nThe Fig 5.9 gives a sketch of y = f1(x) = x, y = f2(x) = x2, y = f3(x) = x3 and y = f4(x)\n= x4. Observe that the curves get steeper as the power of x increases. Steeper the\ncurve, faster is the rate of growth.

For\nexample, consider f10(x) = x10 and \nf15(x)\n= x15. If x increases from 1 to 2, f10\nincreases from 1 to 210 whereas f15\nincreases from 1 to 215. Thus, for the same\nincrement in x, f15 grow faster than f10.\nUpshot of the above discussion is that\nthe growth of polynomial functions is\ndependent  on the degree of the polynomial\nfunction – higher the degree, greater is\nthe growth. The next natural question is:\nIs there a function which grows faster than any polynomial function. The answer is in\naffirmative and an example of such a function is\ny  = f(x) = 10x.\nOur claim is that this function f grows faster than fn (x) = xn for any positive integer n.\nFor example, we can prove that 10x grows faster than f100 (x) = x100. For large values\nof x like x  = 103, note that f100 (x) = (103)100 = 10300 whereas f(103) = 31010 = 101000.\nClearly f(x) is much greater than f100 (x). It is not difficult to prove that for all\nx > 103, f(x) > f100 (x). But we will not attempt to give a proof of this here. Similarly , by\nchoosing large values of x, one can verify that f(x) grows faster than fn (x) for any\npositive integer n.\nDefinition 3 The exponential function with positive base b > 1 is the function\ny = f(x) = bx\nThe graph of y = 10x is given in the Fig 5.9.\nIt is advised that the reader plots this graph for particular values of b like 2, 3 and 4.\nFollowing are some of the salient features of the exponential functions:\n(1) Domain of the exponential function is R, the set of all real numbers.\n(2) Range of the exponential function is the set of all positive real numbers.\n(3) The point (0, 1) is always on the graph of the exponential function (this is a\nrestatement of the fact that b0 = 1 for any real b > 1).\n(4) Exponential function is ever increasing; i.e., as we move from left to right, the\ngraph rises above.Fig  5.9\nReprint 2024-25"

In\nother words, in the second quadrant, the graph approaches x-axis (but never\nmeets it).\nExponential function with base 10 is called the common exponential function . In\nthe Appendix A.1.4 of Class XI, it was observed that the sum of the series\n1 11 ...1! 2!+ + +\nis a number between 2 and 3 and is denoted by e. Using this e as the base we obtain an\nextremely important exponential function y = ex.\nThis is called natural exponential function .\nIt would be interesting to know if the inverse of the exponential function exists and\nhas nice  interpretation. This search motivates the following definition.\nDefinition 4  Let b > 1 be a real number . Then we say logarithm of a to base b is x if\nbx = a.\nLogarithm of a to base b is denoted by logb a. Thus logb a = x if bx = \na.  Let us\nwork with a few explicit examples to get a feel for this. We know 23 = 8. In terms of\nlogarithms, we may rewrite this as log2 8 = 3. Similarly , 104 = 10000 is equivalent to\nsaying log10 10000 = 4. Also, 625 = 54 = 252 is equivalent to saying log5 625 = 4 or\nlog25 625 = 2.\nOn a slightly more mature note, fixing a  base b > 1, we may look at logarithm as\na function from positive real numbers to all real numbers. This function, called the\nlogarithmic function , is defined by\nlogb : R+ →R\nx →logb x = y   if by = x\nAs before if the base b = 10, we say it\nis common logarithms and if b  = e, then\nwe say it is natural logarithms . Often\nnatural logarithm is denoted by ln. In this\nchapter , log x  denotes the logarithm\nfunction to base e , i.e., ln x will be written\nas simpl y log x. The Fig 5.10 gives the plots\nof logarithm function to base 2, e and 10.\nSome of the important observations\nabout the logarithm function to any base\nb > 1 are listed below: Fig 5.10\nReprint 2024-25"

In other\nwords in the fourth quadrant the\ngraph approaches y-axis (but\nnever meets it).\n(6) Fig 5.1 1 gives the plot of y = ex and\ny =\n ln x. It is of interest to observe\nthat the two curves are the mirror\nimages of each other reflected in the line y = x.\nTwo  properties of ‘log’  functions are proved below:\n(1) There is a standard change of base rule to obtain loga p in terms of logb p. Let\nloga p = α, logb p = β and logb a = γ. This means aα = p, bβ = p and bγ = a.\nSubstituting the third equation in the first one, we have\n(bγ)α =bγα = p\nUsing this in the second equation, we get\nbβ =p = bγα\nwhich implies β = αγ or α  =β\nγ. But then\nloga p =log\nlogb\nbp\na\n(2) Another interesting property of the log function is its effect on products. Let\nlogb pq = α. Then bα = pq. If logb p = β and logb q = γ, then bβ = p and bγ = q.\nBut then bα = \npq = bβbγ = bβ + γ\nwhich implies α = β + γ, i.e.,\nlogb pq =logb p + logb q\nReprint 2024-25"

In\nthis case the above may be rewritten as\nlogb p2 = logb p + logb p = 2 log p\nAn easy generalisation of this (left as an exercise!) is\nlogb pn =n log p\nfor any positive integer n. In fact this is true for any real number n, but we will\nnot attempt to prove this. On the similar lines the reader is invited to verify\nlogbx\ny =logb x – logb y\nExample 25 Is it true that x = elog x for all real x?\nSolution First, observe that the domain of log function is set of all positive real numbers.\nSo the above equation is not true for non-positive real numbers. Now , let y = elog x. If\ny > 0, we may take logarithm which gives us log y = log ( elog x) = log x . log e = log x. Thus\ny = x. Hence x = elog x is true only for positive values of x.\nOne of the striking properties of the natural exponential function in differential\ncalculus is that it doesn’t change during the process of differentiation.

For instance, we will learn\nhow the derivative can be used (i) to determine rate of change of quantities, (ii) to find\nthe equations of tangent and normal to a curve at a point, (iii) to find turning points on\nthe graph of a function which in turn will help us to locate points at which largest or\nsmallest value (locally) of a function occurs. We will also use derivative to find intervals\non which a function is increasing or decreasing. Finally , we use the derivative to find\napproximate value of certain quantities.\n6.2Rate of Change of Quantities\nRecall that by the derivative ds\ndt, we mean the rate of change of distance s with\nrespect to the time t.

What is the maximum height the ball will\nreach?\n(iii) An Apache helicopter of enemy is flying along the path given by the curve\nf (x) = x2 + 7. A soldier , placed at the point (1, 2), wants to shoot the helicopter\nwhen it is nearest to him. What is the nearest distance?\nIn each of the above problem, there is something common, i.e., we wish to find out\nthe maximum or minimum values of the given functions. In order to tackle such problems,\nwe first formally define maximum or minimum values of a function, points of local\nmaxima and minima and test for determining such points.\nDefinition 3  Let f be a function defined on an interval I. Then\n(a)  f is said to have a maximum value  in I, if there exists a point c in I such that\n( ) ( )> f c f x , for all x  ∈ I.\nThe number f(c) is called the maximum value of f in I and the point c is called a\npoint of maximum value  of f in I.\n(b)  f  is said to have a minimum value in I, if there exists a point c in I such that\nf(c) < f(x), for all x ∈ I.\nThe number f(c), in this case, is called the minimum value of f in I and the point\nc, in this case, is called a point of minimum value  of  f  in I.\n(c) f is said to have an extreme value in I if there exists a point c in I such that\nf (c) is either a maximum value or a minimum value of f  in I.\nThe number  f(c), in this case, is called an extreme value  of  f  in I and the point c\nis called an extreme point .\nRemark  In Fig 6.7(a), (b) and (c), we have exhibited that graphs of certain particular\nfunctions  help us to find maximum value and minimum value at a point.

Further , we may note that the function even has neither a\nlocal maximum value nor a local minimum value.\nHowever , if we extend the domain of  f  to the closed interval [0, 1], then f still may\nnot have a local maximum (minimum) values but it certainly does have maximum value\n3 = f(1) and minimum value 2 =  f(0). The maximum value 3 of f at x = 1 is called\nabsolute maximum  value ( global maximum  or greatest value ) of f on the interval\n[0, 1]. Similarly , the minimum value 2 of f  at x  = 0 is called the absolute minimum\nvalue (\nglobal minimum  or least value ) of f on [0, 1].\nConsider the graph given in Fig 6.19 of a continuous function defined on a closed\ninterval [ a, d].

Further note that the absolute maximum (minimum)\nvalue of f  is different from local maximum (minimum) value of f.\nWe will now state two results (without proof) regarding absolute maximum and\nabsolute minimum values of a function on a closed interval I.\nTheorem 5  Let f  be a continuous function on an interval I = [ a, b]. Then f has the\nabsolute maximum value and f attains it at least once in I. Also, f has the absolute\nminimum value and attains it at least once in I.\nTheorem 6 Let f be a differentiable function on a closed interval I and let c be any\ninterior point of I. Then\n(i)f′(c) = 0 if  f attains its absolute maximum value at c.\n(ii)f′(c) = 0 if  f attains its absolute minimum value at c.\nIn view of the above results, we have the following working rule for finding absolute\nmaximum and/or absolute minimum values of a function in a given closed interval\n[a, b].\nWorking Rule\nStep 1:Find all critical points of  f  in the interval, i.e., find points x where either\n( ) 0f x=′  or f  is not differentiable.\nStep 2: Take the end points of the interval.\nStep 3:At all these points (listed in Step 1 and 2), calculate the values of  f .\nStep 4:Identify the maximum and minimum values of  f  out of the values calculated in\nStep 3.
