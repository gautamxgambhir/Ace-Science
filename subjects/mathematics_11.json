HARDY  v\n1.1  Introduction\nThe concept of set serves as a fundamental part of the\npresent day mathematics. Today this concept is being used\nin almost every branch of mathematics. Sets are us ed to\ndefine the concepts of relations and functions. The study of\ngeometry , sequences, probability , etc. requires the knowledge\nof sets.\nThe theory of sets was developed by German\nmathematician Georg Cantor (1845-1918). He first\nencountered sets while working on “problems on trigonometric\nseries”. In this Chapter , we discuss some basic definitions\nand operations involving sets.\n1.2  Sets and their Representations\nIn everyday life, we often speak of collections of objects of a particular kind, such as,\na pack of cards, a crowd of people, a cricket team, etc. In mathematics also, we come\nacross collections, for example, of natural numbers, points, prime numbers, etc. More\nspecially , we examine the following collections:\n(i)Odd natural numbers less than 10, i.e., 1, 3, 5, 7, 9\n(ii) The rivers of India\n(iii) The vowels in the English alphabet, namely , a, e, i, o, u\n(iv) Various kinds of triangles\n(v) Prime factors of 210, namely , 2,3,5 and 7\n(vi) The solution of the equation : x2 – 5x + 6 = 0, viz, 2 and 3.\nWe note that each of the above example is a well-defined collection of objects in\n2024-25"

For example, we can say that the river Nile does not belong to\nthe collection of rivers of India. On the other hand, the river Ganga does belong to this\ncolleciton.\nWe give below a few more examples of sets used particularly in mathematics, viz.\nN:the set of all natural numbers\nZ:the set of all integers\nQ:the set of all rational numbers\nR:the set of real numbers\nZ+:the set of positive integers\nQ+:the set of positive rational numbers, and\nR+:the set of positive real numbers.\nThe symbols for the special sets given above will be referred to throughout\nthis text.\nAgain the collection of five most renowned mathematicians of the world is not\nwell-defined, because the criterion for determining a mathematician as most renowned\nmay vary from person to person. Thus, it is not a well-defined collection.\nWe shall say that a set is a well-defined collection of object s.\nThe following points may be noted :\n(i)Objects, elements and members of a set are synonymous  terms.\n(ii) Sets are usually denoted by capital letters A, B, C, X, Y, Z, etc.\n(iii) The elements of a set are represented by small letters a, b, c, x, y , z, etc.\nIf a is an element of a set A, we say that “ a belongs to A” the Greek symbol ∈\n(epsilon) is used to denote the phrase ‘ belongs to ’. Thus, we write a ∈ A. If ‘ b’ is not\nan element of a set A, we write b ∉ A and read  “ b does not belong to A”.\nThus, in the set V of vowels in the English alphabet, a ∈ V but b ∉ \nV. In the set\nP of prime factors of 30, 3 ∈ P but 15 ∉ P.\nThere are two methods of representing a set :\n(i)Roster or tabular form\n(ii) Set-builder form.\n(i) In roster form, all the elements of a set are listed, the elements are being separated\nby commas and are enclosed within braces {   }. For example, the set of all even\npositive integers less than 7 is described in roster form as {2, 4, 6}. Some more\nexamples of representing a set in rost er form are given below :\n(a) The set of all nat ural numbers which divide 42 is {1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 14, 21, 42}.\n2024-25"

The dots\ntell us that the list of odd numbers continue indefinitely .\nANote   It may be noted that while writing the set in roster form an element is not\ngenerally repeated, i.e., all the elements are taken as distinct. For example, the set\nof letters forming the word ‘ SCHOOL ’ is { S, C, H, O, L} or {H, O, L, C, S}. Here,\nthe order of listing elements has no relevance.\n(ii) In set-builder form, all the elements of a set possess a single common property\nwhich is not possessed by any element outside the set. For example, in the set\n{a, e, i, o, u }, all the elements possess a common property , namely , each of them\nis a vowel in the English alphabet, and no other letter possess this property . Denoting\nthis set by V, we write\nV = { x : x is a vowel in English alphabet}\nIt may be observed that we describe the element of the set by using a symbol x\n(any other symbol like the letters y, z, etc. could be used) which is followed by a colon\n“ : ”. After the sign of colon, we write the characteristic property possessed by the\nelements of the set and then enclose the whole description within braces. The above\ndescription of the set V is read as “the set of all x such that x is a vowel of the English\nalphabet”. In this description the braces stand for “the set of all”, the colon stands for\n“such that”. For example, the set\nA = { x : x is a natural number and 3 < x < 10} is read as “the set of all x such that\nx is a natural number and x lies between 3 and 10.” Hence, the numbers 4, 5, 6,\n7, 8 and 9 are the elements of the set A.\nIf we denote the sets described in ( a), (b) and ( c) above in roster form by A, B,\nC, respectively , then A, B, C can also be represented in set-builder form as  follows:\nA= {x : x is a natural number which divides 42}\nB= {y : y is a vowel in the English alphabet}\nC= {z : z is an odd natural number}\nExample 1  Write the solution set of the equation x2 + x – 2 = 0 in roster form.\nSolution\n The given equation can be written as\n(x – 1)  ( x + 2) = 0, i. e.,   x = 1, – 2\nTherefore, the solution set of the given equation can be written in roster form as {1, – 2}.\nExample 2 Write the set { x : x is a positive integer and x2 < 40} in the roster form.\n2024-25"

Then the set of real numbers\n{ y : a < y < b } is called an open inter val and is denoted by ( a, b). All the points\nbetween  a and b belong to the open interval ( a, b) but a, b themselves do not belong to\nthis interval.\nThe interval which contains the end points also is called closed interval  and is\ndenoted by [  a, b ]. Thus\n[ a, b ] = { x : a ≤ x ≤ b}\nWe can also have intervals closed at one end and open at the other , i.e.,\n[ a, b ) = {x : a ≤ x < b} is an open interval  from a to b, including a but excluding b.\n( a, b ] = { x : a < x ≤  b } is an open interval  from a to b including b but excluding a.\nThese notations provide an alternative way of designating the subsets of set of\nreal numbers. For example , if A = (–3, 5) and B = [–7, 9], then A ⊂ B. The set [ 0, ∞)\ndefines the set of non-negative real numbers, while set ( – ∞, 0 ) defines the set of\nnegative real numbers. The set ( – ∞, ∞ ) describes the set of real numbers in relation\nto a line extending from – ∞ to ∞.\nOn real number line, various types of intervals described above as subsets of  R,\nare shown in the Fig 1.1.\nHere, we note that an interval contains infinitely many points.\nFor example, the set { x : x ∈ R, –5 < x ≤ 7}, written in set-builder form, can be\nwritten in the form of interval as (–5, 7] and the interval [–3, 5) can be written in set-\nbuilder form as { x : –3 ≤ x < 5}.Fig 1.1\n2024-25"

For example, while studying the\nsystem of numbers, we are interested in the set of natural numbers and its subsets such\nas the set of all prime numbers, the set of all even numbers, and so forth.

The universal set is usually denoted by U, and all its\nsubsets by the letters A, B, C, etc.\nFor example, for the set of all integers, the universal set can be the set of rational\nnumbers or , for that matter , the set R of real numbers.

Venn diagrams are named after\nthe English logician, John Venn (1834-1883). These\ndiagrams consist of rectangles and  closed curves\nusually circles. The universal set is represented\nusually by a rectangle and its subsets by circles.\nIn Venn diagrams, the elements of the sets are\nwritten in their respective circles (Figs 1.2 and 1.3)\nIllustration 1 In Fig 1.2, U = {1,2,3, ..., 10} is the\nuniversal set of which\nA = {2,4,6,8,10} is a subset.\nIllustration 2 In Fig 1.3, U = {1,2,3, ..., 10} is the\nuniversal set of which\nA = {2,4,6,8,10} and B = {4, 6} are subsets,\nand also B ⊂ A.\nThe reader will see an extensive use of the\nVenn diagrams when we discuss the union, intersection and dif ference of sets.\n1.9  Operations on Sets\nIn earlier classes, we have learnt how to perform the operations of addition, subtraction,\nmultiplication and division on numbers. Each one of these operations was performed\non a pair of numbers to get another number . For example, when we perform the\noperation of addition on the pair of numbers 5 and 13, we get the number 18. Again,\nperforming the operation of multiplication on the pair of numbers 5 and 13, we get 65.Fig 1.2\nFig 1.3\n2024-25"

We will now define certain operations on sets and examine their properties.\nHenceforth, we will refer all our sets as subsets of some universal set.\n1.9.1  Union of set s  Let A and B be any two sets. The union of  A and B is the set\nwhich consists of all the elements of A and all the elements of B, the common elements\nbeing taken only once. The symbol ‘ ∪’ is used to denote the union .

Find X ∪ Y and interpret the set.\nSolution We have, X ∪ \nY = {Ram, Geeta, Akbar , David, Ashok}.

Thus,\n A = {x : x ∈  U and x is not a divisor of 42 }. We see that 2 ∈ U but 2 ∉ A, because\n2 is divisor of 42. Similarly , 3 ∈ U but 3 ∉ A, and 7 ∈ U but 7 ∉ A. Now 2, 3 and 7 are\nthe only elements of U which do not belong to A. The set of these three prime numbers,\ni.e., the set {2, 3, 7} is called the Complement  of A with respect to U, and is  denoted by\nA′. So we have   A′ = {2, 3, 7}. Thus, we see that\nA′  = {x : x ∈ U and \nx ∉ A }. This leads to the following definition.\nDefinition 7 Let U be the universal set and A a subset of U. Then the complement of\nA is the set of all elements of U which are not the elements of A. Symbolically , we\nwrite A′ to denote  the complement of A with respect to U.

These\nare summarised below:\n®A set is a well-defined collection of objects.\n®A set which does not contain any element is called empty set .\n®A set which consists of a definite number of elements is called finite set ,\notherwise, the set is called infinite set .\n®Two sets A and B are said to be equal if they have exactly the same elements.\n®A set A is said to be subset of a set B, if every element of A is also an element\nof B. Intervals are subsets of R.\n®The union of two sets A and B is the set of all those elements which are either\nin A or in B.\n®The intersection of two sets A and B is the set of all elements which are\ncommon. The dif ference of two sets A and B in this order is the set of elements\nwhich belong to A but not to B.\n®The complement of a subset A of universal set U is the set of all elements of U\nwhich are not the elements of A.\n®For any two sets A and B, (A  ∪ B)′ = A′ ∩ B′ and ( A ∩ B )′ = A′ ∪ B′\nHistorical Note\nThe modern theory of sets is considered to have been originated largely by the\nGerman mathematician Georg Cantor (1845-1918). His papers on set theory\nappeared sometimes during 1874 to 1897. His study of set  theory came when he\nwas studying trigonometric series of the form a1 sin x + a2 sin 2 x + a3 sin 3\nx + ...\nHe published in a paper in 1874  that the set of real numbers could not be put into\none-to-one correspondence wih the integers. From 1879 onwards, he publishd\nseveral papers showing various properties of abstract sets.\n2024-25"

But Kronecker (1810-1893) castigated him for regarding\ninfinite set the same way as finite sets. Another German mathematician Gottlob\nFrege, at the turn of the century , presented the set theory as principles of logic.\nTill then the entire set theory was based on the assumption of the existence of the\nset of all sets. It was the famous Englih Philosopher Bertand Russell (1872-\n1970 ) who showed in 1902 that the assumption of existence of a set of all sets\nleads to a contradiction. This led to the famous Russell’ s Paradox. Paul R.Halmos\nwrites about it in his book ‘Naïve  Set Theory’ that “nothing contains everything”.\nThe Russell’ s Paradox was not the only one which arose in set theory .\nMany paradoxes were produced later by several mathematicians and logicians.\nAs a consequence of all these paradoxes, the first axiomatisation of set theory\nwas published in 1908 by Ernst Zermelo. Another one was proposed by Abraham\nFraenkel in 1922.  John Von Neumann in 1925  introduced explicitly the axiom of\nregularity . Later in 1937 Paul Bernays gave a set of more satisfactory\naxiomatisation. A modification of these axioms was done by Kurt Gödel in his\nmonograph in 1940. This was known as V on Neumann-Bernays (VNB) or Gödel-\nBernays (GB) set theory .\nDespite all these dif ficulties, Cantor ’s set theory is used in present day\nmathematics. In fact, these days most of the concepts and results in mathematics\nare expressed in the set theoretic language.\n \n—vvv\nvv—\n2024-25"

In our\ndaily life, we come across many patterns that characterise\nrelations such as brother and sister , father and son, teacher\nand student. In mathematics also, we come across many\nrelations such as number m is less than number n, line l is\nparallel to line m, set A is a subset of set B. In all these, we\nnotice that a relation involves pairs of objects in certain\norder . In this Chapter , we will learn how to link pairs of\nobjects from two sets and then introduce relations between\nthe two objects in the pair . Finally , we will learn about\nspecial relations which will qualify to be functions. The\nconcept of function is very important in mathematics since it captures the idea of a\nmathematically precise correspondence between one quantity with the other .\n2.2  Cartesian Products of Sets\nSuppose A is a set of 2 colours and B is a set of  3 objects, i.e.,\nA = {red, blue}and B = { b, c, s},\nwhere b, c and s represent a particular bag, coat and shirt, respectively .\nHow many pairs of coloured objects can be made from these two sets?\nProceeding in a very orderly manner , we can see that there will be 6\ndistinct pairs as given below:\n(red, b), (red, c), (red, s), (blue, b ), (blue, c), (blue, s).\nThus, we get 6 distinct objects (Fig 2.1).\nLet us recall from our earlier classes that an ordered pair of elements\ntaken from any two sets P and Q is a pair of elements written in smallFig 2.1Chapter 2\nRELA TIONS AND FUNCTIONS\nG .

This gives us 9 possible codes. Also\nnote that the order in which these elements are paired is crucial. For example, the code\n(DL, 01) will not be the same as the code (01, DL).\nAs a final illustration, consider the two sets A= { a1, a2} and\nB = {b1, b2, b3, b4} (Fig 2.3) .\nA × B= {( a1, b1), (a1, b2), (a1, b3), (a1, b4), (a2, b1), (a2, b2),\n                   ( a2, b3), (a2, b4)}.\nThe 8 ordered pairs thus formed can represent the position of points in\nthe plane if A and B are subsets of the set of real numbers and it is\nobvious that the point in the position ( a1, b2) will be distinct from the point\nin the position ( b2, a1).\nRemarks\n(i)Two ordered pairs are equal, if and only if  the corresponding first elements\nare equal and the second  elements are also equal.DL MP KA03\n02\n01\nFig 2.2\nFig 2.3\n2024-25"

It is one of the most\nimportant concepts in mathematics. We can, visualise a function as a rule, which produces\nnew elements out of some given elements.  There are many terms such as ‘map’ or\n‘mapping’ used to denote a function.\nDefinition 5  A relation f from a set A to a set B is said to be a function if every\nelement of set A has one and only one image in set B.\nIn other words, a function f is a relation from a non-empty set A to a non-empty\nset B such that the domain of f is A and no two distinct ordered pairs in f  have the\nsame first element.\nIf f is a function from A to B and ( a, b) ∈ f, then f (a) = b, where b  is called the\nimage of a  under f  and a  is called the preimage  of b  under f.Fig 2.7\n2024-25"

Similarly , the relation in  Example 9 is\nalso not a function. ( Why?) In the examples given below , we will see many more\nrelations some of which are functions and others are not.\nExample 10  Let N be the set of natural numbers and the relation R be defined on\nN such that  R = {( x, y) : y = 2\nx, x, y ∈ N}.\nWhat is the domain, codomain and range of R? Is this relation a function?\nSolution The domain of R is the set of natural numbers N. The codomain is also N.\nThe range is the set of even natural numbers.\nSince every natural number n has one and only one image, this relation is a\nfunction.\nExample 1 1 Examine each of the following relations given below and state in each\ncase, giving reasons whether it is a function or not?\n(i) R = {(2,1),(3,1), (4,2)}, (ii) R = {(2,2),(2,4),(3,3), (4,4)}\n(iii) R = {(1,2),(2,3),(3,4), (4,5), (5,6), (6,7)}\nSolution (i) Since 2, 3, 4 are the elements of domain of R having their unique images,\nthis relation R is a function.\n(ii) Since the same first element 2 corresponds to two different images 2\nand 4, this relation is not a function.\n(iii) Since every element has one and only one image, this relation is a\nfunction.\nDefinition 6 A function which has either R or one of its subsets as its range is called\na real valued function . Further , if its domain is also either R or a subset of R, it is\ncalled a real function .\nExample 12  Let N be the set of natural numbers.

The subject was originally developed to solve\ngeometric problems involving triangles. It was studied by\nsea captains for navigation, surveyor to map out the new\nlands, by engineers and others. Currently , trigonometry is\nused in many areas such as the science of seismology ,\ndesigning electric circuits, describing the state of an atom,\npredicting the heights of tides in the ocean, analysing a\nmusical tone and in many other areas.\nIn earlier classes, we have studied the trigonometric\nratios of acute angles as the ratio of the sides of a right\nangled triangle. We have also studied the trigonometric identities and application of\ntrigonometric ratios in solving the problems related to heights and distances. In this\nChapter , we will generalise the concept of trigonometric ratios to trigonometric functions\nand study their properties.\n3.2  Angles\nAngle is a measure of rotation of a given ray about its initial point.

The point of rotation is called the vertex . If the direction of\nrotation is anticlockwise, the angle is said to be positive  and if the direction of rotation\nis clockwise, then the angle is negative (Fig 3.1).\nThe measure of an angle is the amount of\nrotation performed to get the terminal side from\nthe initial side. There are several units for\nmeasuring angles. The definition of an angle\nsuggests a unit, viz. one complete r evolution  from the position of the initial side as\nindicated in Fig 3.2.\nThis is often convenient for large angles.

Angle subtended at the centre by an arc of length 1 unit in a\nunit circle (circle of radius 1 unit) is said to have a measure of 1 radian.

The ancient Indian\nMathematicians, Aryabhatta (476), Brahmagupta (598), Bhaskara I (600) and\nBhaskara II (1 114) got important results. All this knowledge first went from\nIndia to middle-east and from there to Europe. The Greeks had also started the\nstudy of trigonometry but their approach was so clumsy that when the Indian\napproach became known, it was immediately adopted throughout the world.\nIn India, the predecessor of the modern trigonometric functions, known as\nthe sine of an angle, and the introduction of the sine function represents the main\ncontribution of the siddhantas (Sanskrit astronomical works) to the history of\nmathematics.\nBhaskara I (about 600) gave formulae to find the values of sine functions\nfor angles more than 90 °. A sixteenth century Malayalam work Yuktibhasa\n(period) contains a proof for the expansion of sin (A + B). Exact expression for\nsines or cosines of 18 °, 36 °, 54 °, 72 °, etc., are given by\nBhaskara II.\n2024-25"

Hamilton\n(1805-1865)\nvMathematics is the Queen of Sciences and Arithmetic is the Queen of\nMathematics. – GAUSS v\n4.1  Introduction\nIn earlier classes, we have studied linear equations in one\nand two variables and quadratic equations in one variable.\nWe have seen that the equation x2 + 1 = 0 has no real\nsolution as x2 + 1 = 0 gives x2 = – 1 and square of every\nreal number is non-negative. So, we need to extend the\nreal number system to a larger system so that we can\nfind the solution of the equation x2 = – 1. In fact, the main\nobjective is to solve the equation ax2 + bx + c = 0, where\nD = b2 –  4ac < 0, which is not possible in the system of\nreal numbers.\n4.2  Complex Numbers\nLet us denote 1− by the symbol i. Then, we have 21 i=− . This means that i is a\nsolution of the equation x2 + 1 = 0.\nA number of the form a + ib, where a and b are real numbers, is defined to be a\ncomplex number . For example, 2 + i3,  (– 1) + 3i,  1411i− +   are complex numbers.\nFor the complex number z = a + ib, a is called the real par t, denoted by Re z and\nb is called the imaginary part  denoted by Im z of the complex number z . For example,\nif z = 2 + i5, then Re z = 2 and Im \nz = 5.\nTwo complex numbers z1 = a + ib and z2 = c + id are equal if  a = c and b = d.4\n2024-25"

We observe that z + (–z) = 0\n(the additive identity).\n4.3.2   Difference of two complex numbers  Given any two complex numbers z1 and\nz2, the difference z1 – z2 is defined as follows:\nz1 – z2 = z1 + (– z2).\nFor example, (6 + 3 i) – (2 – i) = (6 + 3 i) + (– 2 +\n i ) = 4 + 4i\nand (2 –  i) – (6 + 3 i) = (2 – i ) + ( – 6 – 3 i) = – 4 – 4 i\n2024-25"

Now a\nnatural question arises: ‘Is it always possible to translate a statement problem in the\nform of an equation? For example, the height of all the students in your class is less\nthan 160 cm. Your classroom can occupy atmost 60 tables or chairs or both. Here we\nget certain statements involving a sign ‘<’ (less than), ‘>’ (greater than), ‘ ≤’ (less than\nor equal) and ≥ (greater than or equal) which are known as inequalities .\nIn this Chapter , we will study linear inequalities in one and two variables. The\nstudy of inequalities is very useful in solving problems in the field of science, mathematics,\nstatistics, economics, psychology , etc.\n5.2 Inequalities\nLet us consider the following situations:\n(i) Ravi goes to market with ` 200 to buy rice, which is available in packets of 1kg. The\nprice of one packet of rice is ` 30. If x denotes the number of packets of rice, which he\nbuys, then the total amount spent by him is ` 30x. Since, he has to buy rice in packets\nonly, he may not be able to spend the entire amount of ` 200. (Why?) Hence\n30x < 200 ... (1)\nClearly the statement (i) is not an equation as it does not involve the sign of equality .\n(ii) Reshma has ` 120 and wants to buy some registers and pens. The cost of one\nregister is  ` 40 and that of a pen is ` 20. In this case, if x denotes the number of\nregisters and y, the number of pens which Reshma buys, then the total amount spent by\nher is \n` (40x  +  20y) and we have\n40x + 20y ≤ 120 ...

Left hand side (L.H.S.) of this\ninequality is 30 x and right hand side (RHS) is 200. Therefore, we have\nFor x = 0, L.H.S. = 30 (0) = 0 < 200 (R.H.S.), which is true.\nFor x = 1, L.H.S. = 30 (1) = 30 < 200 (R.H.S.), which is true.\nFor x = 2, L.H.S. = 30 (2) = 60 < 200, which is true.\nFor x = 3, L.H.S. = 30 (3) = 90 < 200, which is true.\nFor x = 4, L.H.S. = 30 (4) = 120 < 200, which is true.\nFor x = 5, L.H.S. = 30 (5) = 150 < 200, which is true.\nFor x = 6, L.H.S. = 30 (6) = 180 < 200, which is true.\nFor x = 7, L.H.S. = 30 (7) = 210 < 200, which is false.\nIn the above situation, we find that the values of x, which makes the above\ninequality a true statement, are 0,1,2,3,4,5,6. These values of x, which make above\ninequality a true statement, are called solutions  of inequality and the set {0,1,2,3,4,5,6}\nis called its solution set .\nThus, any solution of an inequality in one variable is a value of the variable\nwhich makes it a true statement.\nWe have found the solutions of the above inequality by trial and er ror method\nwhich is not very ef ficient. Obviously , this method is time consuming and sometimes\nnot feasible. We must have some better or systematic techniques for solving inequalities.\nBefore that we should go through some more properties of numerical inequalities and\nfollow them as rules while solving the inequalities.\nYou will recall that while solving linear equations, we followed the following rules:\nRule 1  Equal numbers may be added to (or subtracted from) both sides of an equation.\nRule 2  Both sides of an equation may be multiplied (or divided) by the same non-zero\nnumber .\nIn the case of solving inequalities, we again follow the same rules except with a\ndifference that in Rule 2, the sign of inequality is reversed (i.e., ‘<‘ becomes ‘>’, ≤’\nbecomes ‘≥’ and so on) whenever we multiply (or divide) both sides of an inequality by\na negative number . It is evident from the facts that\n3 > 2 while – 3 < – 2,\n– 8 < – 7 while (– 8) (– 2) > (– 7) (– 2) , i.e., 16 > 14.\n2024-25"

The number\nlock has 4 wheels each labelled with 10 digits from 0 to 9.\nThe lock can be opened if 4 specific digits are arranged in a\nparticular sequence with no repetition. Some how , you have\nforgotten this specific sequence of digits. You remember only\nthe first digit which is 7. In order to open  the lock, how\nmany sequences of 3-digits you may have to check with? To\nanswer this question, you may , immediately , start listing all\npossible arrangements of  9 remaining digits taken 3 at a\ntime. But, this method will be tedious, because the number\nof possible sequences may be lar ge. Here, in this Chapter ,\nwe shall learn some basic counting techniques which will\nenable us to answer this question without actually listing 3-digit arrangements. In fact,\nthese techniques will be useful in determining the number of different ways of arranging\nand selecting objects without actually listing them. As a first step, we shall examine a\nprinciple which is most fun damental to th e learning of these techniques.\n6.2  Fundamental Principle of Counting\nLet us consider the following problem. Mohan has 3 pants and 2 shirts. How many\ndifferent pairs of a pant and a shirt, can he dress up with? There are 3 ways in which\na pant can be chosen, because there are 3 pants available. Similarly , a shirt can be\nchosen in 2 ways. For every choice of a pant, there are 2 choices of a shirt. Therefore,\nthere are 3 × 2 = 6 pairs of a pant and a shirt.6 Chapter\nPERMUT ATIONS AND COMBINA TIONS\nJacob Bernoulli\n(1654-1705)\n2024-25"

For\nexample, for 3 events, the principle is as follows:\n‘If an event can occur in m different ways, following which another event can\noccur in n different ways, following which a third event can occur in p different ways,\nthen the total number of occurrence to ‘the events in the given order is m × n × p.”\nIn the first problem, the required number of ways of wearing a pant and a shirt\nwas the number of different ways of the occuren ce of the following events in succession:\n(i) the event of choosing a pant\n(ii) the event of choosing a shirt.\nIn the second problem, the required number of ways was the number of different\nways of the occurence of the following events in succession:\n(i) the event of choosing a school bag\n(ii) the event of choosing a tiffin box\n(iii) the event of choosing a water bottle.\nHere, in both the cases, the events in each problem could occur in various possible\norders.

The credit, however , goes to the\nJains who treated its subject matter as a self-contained topic in mathematics,\nunder the name Vikalpa .\nAmong the Jains, Mahavira , (around 850) is perhaps the world’ s first\nmathematician credited with providing the general formulae for permutations and\ncombinations.\nIn the 6th century B.C., Sushruta, in his medicinal work, Sushruta Samhita\n,\nasserts that 63 combinations can be made out of 6 different tastes, taken one at a\ntime, two at a time, etc. Pingala, a Sanskrit scholar around third century B.C.,\ngives the method of determining the number of combinations of a given number\nof letters, taken one at a time, two at a time, etc. in his work Chhanda Sutra .\nBhaskarachar ya (born 1 114) treated the subject matter of permutations and\ncombinations under the name Anka Pasha  in his famous work Lilavati.  In addition\nto the general formulae for nCr and nPr already provided by Mahavira,\nBhaskaracharya  gives several important theorems and results concerning the\nsubject.\nOutside India, the subject matter of permutations and combinations had its\nhumble beginnings in China in the famous book I–King (Book of changes). It is\ndifficult to give the approximate time of this work, since in 213 B.C., the emperor\nhad ordered all books and manuscripts in the country to be burnt which fortunately\nwas not completely carried out. Greeks and later Latin writers also did some\nscattered work on the theory of permutations and combinations.\nSome Arabic and Hebrew writers used the concepts of permutations and\ncombinations in studying astronomy . Rabbi ben Ezra,  for instance, determined\nthe number of combinations of known planets taken two at a time, three at a time\nand so on. This was around 1 140. It appears that Rabbi ben Ezra  did not know\n2024-25"

STEINMETZ v\n7.1 Introduction\nIn earlier classes, we have learnt how to find the squares\nand cubes of binomials like a + b and a – b. Using them, we\ncould evaluate the numerical values of numbers like\n(98)2 = (100 – 2)2, (999)3 = (1000 – 1)3, etc. However , for\nhigher powers like (98)5, (101)6, etc., the calculations become\ndifficult by using repeated multiplication. This difficulty was\novercome by a theorem known as binomial theorem. It gives\nan easier way to expand ( a + b)n, where n  is an integer or a\nrational number . In this Chapter , we study binomial theorem\nfor positive integral indices only .\n7.2 Binomial Theorem for Positive Integral Indices\nLet us have a look at the following identities done earlier:\n(a+ b)0 = 1 a + b ≠ 0\n(a+ b)1 = a + \nb\n(a+ b)2 = a2 + 2ab + b2\n(a+ b)3 = a3 + 3a2b + 3ab2 + b3\n(a+ b)4 = (a + b)3 (a + b) = a4 + 4a3b + 6a2b2 + 4ab3 + b4\nIn these expansions, we observe that\n(i)The total number of terms in the expansion is one more than the index. For\nexample, in the expansion of ( a + b)2 , number of terms is 3 whereas the index of\n(a + b)2 is 2.\n(ii) Powers of the first quantity ‘ a’ go on decreasing by 1 whereas the powers of the\nsecond quantity ‘ b’ increase by 1, in the successive terms.\n(iii) In each term of the expansion, the sum of the indices of a and b  is the same and\nis equal to the index of a + b.7 Chapter\nBlaise Pascal\n(1623-1662)\nBINOMIAL  THEOREM\n2024-25"

The addition of 1, 2 and 2, 1 in the row for index 2, gives rise to 3 and 3 in\nthe row for index 3 and so on. Also, 1 is present at the beginning and at the end of each\nrow. This can be continued till any index of our interest.\nWe can extend the pattern given in Fig 7.2 by writing a few more rows.\nPascal’ s Triangle\nThe structure given in Fig 7.2  looks like a triangle with 1 at the top vertex and running\ndown the two slanting sides. This array of numbers is known as Pascal’ s triangle ,\nafter the name of French mathematician Blaise Pascal. It is also known as Meru\nPrastara  by Pingla.\nExpansions for the higher powers of a binomial are also possible by using Pascal’ s\ntriangle. Let us expand (2 x + 3y)5 by using Pascal’ s triangle.

This can be done by writing all the rows of the Pascal’ s triangle\ntill index 12. This is a slightly lengthy process. The process, as you observe, will become\nmore difficult, if we need the expansions involving still larger powers.\nWe thus try to find a rule that will help us to find the expansion of the binomial for\nany power without writing all the rows of the Pascal’ s triangle, that come before the\nrow of the desired index.\nFor this, we make use of the concept of combinations studied earlier to rewrite\nthe numbers in the Pascal’ s triangle.

Also,   nC0 = 1 = nCn\nThe Pascal’ s triangle can now be rewritten as (Fig 7.3)\nObserving this pattern, we can now write the row of the Pascal’ s triangle for any index\nwithout writing the earlier rows. For example, for the index 7 the row would be\n7C0  7C1    7C2    7C3    7C4    7C5    7C6    7C7.\nThus, using this row and the observations (i), (ii) and (iii), we have\n(a + b)7 = 7C0 a7\n + 7C1a6b + 7C2a5b2 + 7C3a4b3 + 7C4a3b4 + 7C5a2b5 + 7C6ab6 + 7C7b7\nAn expansion of a binomial to any positive integral index say n can now be visualised\nusing these observations.

When we say that a\ncollection of objects is listed in a sequence, we usually  mean\nthat the collection is ordered in such a way that it has an\nidentified first member , second member , third member and\nso on. For example, population of human beings or bacteria\nat different times form a sequence. The amount of money\ndeposited in a bank, over a number of years form a sequence.\nDepreciated values of certain commodity occur in a\nsequence. Sequences have important applications in several\nspheres of human activities.\nSequences, following specific patterns are called progressions . In previous class,\nwe have studied about arithmetic pr ogression (A.P). In this Chapter , besides discussing\nmore about A.P.; arithmetic mean, geometric mean, r elationship between A.M.\nand G .M., special series in forms of sum to n terms of consecutive natural numbers,\nsum to n terms of squar es of natural numbers and sum to n terms of cubes of\nnatural numbers will also be studied.\n8.2  Sequences\nLet us consider the following examples:\nAssume that there is a generation gap of 30 years, we are asked to find the\nnumber of ancestors, i.e., parents, grandparents, great grandparents, etc. that a person\nmight have over 300 y ears.\nHere, the total number of generations = 3001030=\nFibonacci\n(1175-1250)Chapter\nSEQUENCES AND SERIES8\n2024-25"

These numbers form what we call a sequence .\nConsider the successive quotients that we obtain in the division of 10 by 3 at\ndifferent steps of division. In this process we get 3,3.3,3.33,3.333, ... and so on. These\nquotients also form a sequence. The various numbers occurring in a sequence are\ncalled its terms . We denote the terms of a sequence by a1, a2, a3, …, an, …, etc., the\nsubscripts denote the position of the term. The nth term is the number at th e nth position\nof the sequence and is denoted by an. The nth term is also called the general\n term of the\nsequence.\nThus, the terms of the sequence of person’ s ancestors mentioned above are:\na1 = 2, a2 = 4, a3 = 8, …, a10 = 1024.\nSimilarly , in the example of successive quotients\na1 = 3, a2 = 3.3, a3 = 3.33, …, a6 = 3.33333, etc.\nA sequence containing finite number of terms is called a finite sequence . For\nexample, sequence of ancestors is a finite sequence since it contains 10 terms (a fixed\nnumber).\nA sequence is called infinite , if it is not a finite sequence. For example, the\nsequence of successive quotients mentioned above is an infinite sequence , infinite in\nthe sense that it never ends.\nOften, it is possible to express the rule, which yields the various terms of a sequence\nin terms of algebraic formula. Consider for instance, the sequence of even natural\nnumbers 2, 4, 6, …\nHere a1 = 2 = 2 × 1 a2 = 4 = 2 × 2\na3 = 6 = 2 × 3 a4 = 8 = 2 × 4\n....     ....    ....\n....     ....    ....\n....     ....    .... ....     ....    ....\na23 = 46 = 2 × 23, a24 = 48 = 2 × 24, \nand so on.\nIn fact, we see that the nth term of this sequence can be written as an =  2n,\nwhere n is a natural number . Similarly , in the sequence of odd natural numbers 1,3,5, …,\nthe nth term is given by the formula, an = 2n – 1, where n is a natural number .\nIn some cases, an arrangement of numbers such as 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8,.. has no visible\npattern, but the sequence is generated by the recurrence relation given by\na1 = a2 = 1\na3 = a1 + a2\nan = an – 2 + an – 1, n > 2\nThis sequence is called Fibonacci  sequence .\n2024-25"

However , we expect a theoretical scheme or a rule for generating\nthe terms a1, a2, a3,…,an,… in succession.\nIn view of the above, a sequence can be r egarded as a function whose domain\nis the set of natural numbers or some subset of it. Sometimes, we use the functional\nnotation a(n) for an.\n8.3  Series\nLet a1, a2, a3,…,an, be a given sequence. Then, the expression\na1 + a2 + a3 +,… + an + ...\nis called the series associated with the given sequence  .The series is finite or infinite\naccording as the given sequence is finite or infinite.

When we use the phrase\n“sum of a series ,” we will mean the number that results from adding the terms, the\nsum of the series is 16.\nWe now consider some examples.\nExample 1  Write the first three terms in each of the following sequences defined by\nthe following:\n(i)an = 2n + 5, (ii) an = 3\n4n−\n.\nSolution  (i) Here  an = 2n + 5\nSubstituting n =1, 2, 3, we get\na1 \n=2(1) + 5 = 7, a2 = 9, a3 = 11\nTherefore, the required terms are 7, 9 and 1 1.\n(ii) Here an = 3\n4n−.

A systematic study of geometry by the use\nof algebra was first carried out by celebrated French\nphilosopher and mathematician René Descartes, in his book\n‘La Géométry , published in 1637. This book introduced the\nnotion of the equation of a curve and related analytical\nmethods into the study of geometry . The resulting\ncombination of analysis and geometry is referred now as\nanalytical geometr y. In the earlier classes, we initiated\nthe study of coordinate geometry , where we   studied about\ncoordinate axes, coordinate plane, plotting of points in a\nplane, distance between two points, section formulae, etc. All these concepts are the\nbasics of coordinate geometry .\nLet us have a brief recall of coordinate geometry done in earlier classes. To\nrecapitulate, the location of the points (6, – 4) and\n(3, 0) in the XY -plane is shown in Fig 9.1.\nWe may note that the point (6, – 4) is at 6 units\ndistance from the y-axis measured along the positive\nx-axis and at 4 units distance from the x-axis\nmeasured along the negative y-axis. Similarly , the\npoint (3, 0) is at 3 units distance from the y-axis\nmeasured along  the positive x-axis and has zero\ndistance from the x-axis.\nWe also studied there following important\nformulae:9 Chapter\nSTRAIGHT LINES\nRené Descartes\n (1596 -1650)\nFig 9.1\n2024-25"

This relationship\nbetween line and points leads us to find the solution of the following problem:\nHow can we say that a given point lies on the given line? Its answer may be that\nfor a given line we should have a definite condition on the points lying on the line.\nSuppose P  (x, y) is an arbitrary point in the XY -plane and L  is the given line. For the\nequation of L, we wish to construct a statement  or condition  for the point P that is\ntrue, when P is on L, otherwise false. Of course the statement is merely an algebraic\nequation involving the variables x and \ny. Now , we will discuss the equation of a line\nunder different conditions.\n9.3.1  Horizontal and vertical lines  If a horizontal line L is at a distance a from the x-\naxis then ordinate of every point lying on the line is either a or – a [Fig 9.8 (a)] .\nTherefore, equation of the line L is either y =  a or y = – a. Choice of sign will depend\nupon the position of the line according as the line is above or below the y-axis. Similarly ,\nthe equation of a vertical line at a distance b from the y-axis is either x = b or\nx =  – b  [Fig 9.8(b)].\n2024-25"

In this Chapter , we shall study\nabout some other curves, viz., circles, ellipses, parabolas\nand hyperbolas. The names parabola and hyperbola are\ngiven by Apollonius. These curves are in fact, known as\nconic sections  or more commonly conics  because they\ncan be obtained as intersections of a plane with a double\nnapped right circular cone. These curves have a very wide\nrange of applications in fields such as planetary motion,\ndesign of telescopes and antennas, reflectors in flashlights\nand automobile headlights, etc.  Now , in the subsequent sections we will see how the\nintersection of a plane with a double napped right circular cone\nresults in different types of curves.\n10.2 Sections of a Cone\nLet l be a fixed vertical line and m be another line intersecting it at\na fixed point V and inclined to it at an angle α (Fig10.1).\nSuppose we rotate the line m around the line l in such a way\nthat the angle α remains constant.

Thus, conic sections are the curves obtained by intersecting a right\ncircular cone by a plane.\nWe obtain dif ferent kinds of conic sections depending on the position of the\nintersecting plane with respect to the cone and by the angle made by it with the vertical\naxis of the cone.

(3)\nand  so P(x ,y) lies  on the parabola.\nThus, from (2) and (3) we have  proved that the equation to the parabola with\nvertex at the origin, focus at ( a,0) and directrix x = – a is y2 = 4ax.\nDiscussion  In equation (2), since a > 0, x  can assume any positive value or zero but\nno negative value and the curve extends indefinitely far into the first and the fourth\nquadrants.

Parabola is symmetric with respect to the axis of the parabola.If the equation\nhas a y2 term, then the axis of symmetry is along the x-axis and if the\nequation has an x2 term, then the axis of symmetry is along the y-axis.\n2. When the axis of symmetry is along the x-axis  the parabola opens to the\n(a) right if the coefficient of x is positive,\n(b) left if the coefficient of x  is negative.\n3. When the axis of symmetry is along the y-axis the parabola opens\n(c) upwards if the coefficient of y is positive.\n(d) downwards if the coefficient of y is negative.\n2024-25"

The Greek\ngeometers investigated the properties of many curves that have theoretical and\npractical importance. Euclid wrote his treatise on geometry around 300 B.C. He\nwas the first who organised the geometric figures based on certain axioms\nsuggested by physical considerations. Geometry as initially studied by the ancient\nIndians and Greeks, who made essentially no use of the process of algebra. The\nsynthetic approach to the subject of geometry as given by Euclid and in\nSulbasutras , etc., was continued for some 1300 years. In the 200 B.C., Apollonius\nwrote a book called ‘ The Conic ’ which was all about conic sections with many\nimportant discoveries that have remained unsurpassed for eighteen centuries.\nModern analytic geometry is called ‘ Cartesian ’ after the name of Rene\nDescartes (1596-1650) whose relevant ‘La Geometrie’ was published in 1637.\nBut the fundamental principle and method of analytical geometry were already\ndiscovered by Pierre de Fermat (1601-1665). Unfortunately , Fermats treatise on\nthe subject, entitled Ad Locus Planos et So LIDOS Isagoge (Introduction to\nPlane and Solid Loci) was published only posthumously in\n1679. So, Descartes came to be regarded as the unique inventor of the analytical\ngeom etry.\nIsaac Barrow avoided using cartesian method. Newton used method of\nundetermined coefficients to find equations of curves. He used several types of\ncoordinates including polar and bipolar . Leibnitz used the terms ‘ abscissa ’,\n‘ordinate’  and ‘coordinate’. L ’ Hospital (about 1700) wrote an important textbook\non analytical geometry .\nClairaut (1729) was the first to give the distance formula although in clumsy\nform. He also gave the intercept form of the linear equation. Cramer (1750)\n2024-25"

The Greeks particularly Archimedes (287–212 B.C.)\nand Apollonius (200 B.C.) studied conic sections for their own beauty .

These\nthree planes intersect along the lines X ′OX, Y′OY\nand Z′OZ, called the x, y and z-axes, respectively .\nWe may note that these lines are mutually\nperpendicular to each other . These lines constitute\nthe rectangular coor dinate system . The planes\nXOY , YOZ and ZOX, called, respectively the\nXY-plane , YZ-plane  and the ZX- plane , are\nknown as the three coordinate planes. We take\nthe XOY plane as the plane of the paper and the\nline Z′OZ as perpendicular to the plane XOY . If the plane of the paper is considered\nas horizontal, then the line Z ′OZ will be vertical. The distances measured from\nXY-plane upwards in the direction of OZ are taken as positive and those measured\ndownwards in the direction of OZ ′ are taken as negative. Similarly , the distance\nmeasured to the right of ZX-plane along OY are taken as positive, to the left of\nZX-plane and along OY ′ as negative, in front of the YZ-plane along OX as positive\nand to the back of it along OX ′ as negative. The point O is called the origin  of the\ncoordinate system. The three coordinate planes divide the space into eight parts known\nas octants . These octants could be named as XOYZ, X ′OYZ, X′OY′Z, XOY′Z,  XOYZ′,\nX′OYZ′, X′OY′Z′ and XOY′Z′. and denoted by I, II, III, ..., VIII , respectively .\n11.3  Coordinates of a Point in Space\nHaving chosen a fixed coordinate system in the\nspace, consisting of coordinate axes, coordinate\nplanes and the origin, we now explain, as to how ,\ngiven a point in the space, we associate with it three\ncoordinates ( x,y,z) and conversely , given a triplet\nof three numbers ( x, y, z), how , we locate a point in\nthe space.\nGiven a point P in space, we drop a\nperpendicular PM on the XY -plane with M as the\nfoot of this perpendicular (Fig 1 1.2). Then, from the point M, we draw a perpendicular\nML to the x-axis, meeting it at L. Let OL be x, LM be y and MP be z. Then x,y and z\nare called the x, y and z coordinates , respectively , of the point P  in the space. In\nFig 1 1.2, we may note that the point P  (x, y, z) lies in the octant XOYZ and so all x, y,\nz are positive.

Thus, to each point P  in the space there corresponds an ordered triplet\n(x, y, z) of real numbers.\nConversely , given any triplet ( x, y, z), we would first fix the point L  on the x-axis\ncorresponding to x, then locate the point M in the XY -plane such that ( x, y) are the\ncoordinates of the point M in the XY -plane. Note that LM is perpendicular to the\nx-axis or is parallel to the y-axis. Having reached the point M, we draw a perpendicular\nMP to the XY -plane and locate on it the point P  corresponding to z. The point P  so\nobtained has then the coordinates ( x, y, z). Thus, there is a one to one correspondence\nbetween the points in space and ordered triplet ( x, y, z) of real numbers.\nAlternatively , through the point P  in the\nspace, we draw three planes parallel to the\ncoordinate planes, meeting the x-axis, y-axis\nand z-axis in the points A, B and C, respectively\n(Fig 1 1.3). Let OA  = x, OB = y and OC = z.\nThen, the point P will have the coordinates x, y\nand z and we write P  (x, y, z).

Calculus is that\nbranch of mathematics which mainly deals with the study\nof change in the value of a function as the points in the\ndomain change. First, we give an intuitive idea of derivative\n(without actually defining it). Then we give a naive definition\nof limit and study some algebra of limits. Then we come\nback to a definition of derivative and study some algebra\nof derivatives. We also obtain derivatives of certain\nstandard functions.\n12.2  Intuitive Idea of Derivatives\nPhysical experiments have confirmed that the body dropped\nfrom a tall cliff covers a distance of 4.9 t2 metres in t seconds,\ni.e., distance s in metres covered by the body as a function of time t in seconds is given\nby s = 4.9t2.\nThe adjoining Table 13.1 gives the distance travelled in metres at various intervals\nof time in seconds of a body dropped from a tall cliff.\nThe objective is to find the veloctiy of the body at time t = 2 seconds from this\ndata. One way to approach this problem is to find the average velocity for various\nintervals of time ending at t = 2 seconds and hope that these throw some light on the\nvelocity at t = 2 seconds.\nAverage velocity between t = t1 and t = t2 equals distance travelled between\n t = t1 and t = t2  seconds divided by  ( t2 – t1).

In the second set of computations, we have found the average velocities\ndecreasing in time intervals ending at t = 2 and then hope that nothing dramatic happens\njust after t = 2. Purely on the physical grounds, both these sequences of average\nvelocities must approach a common limit. We can safely conclude that the velocity of\nthe body at t = 2 is between 19.551 m/s and 19.649 m/s. Technically , we say that the\ninstantaneous velocity at t = 2 is between 19.551 m/s and 19.649 m/s. As is\nwell-known, velocity is the rate of change of displacement . Hence what we have\naccomplished is the following. From the given data of distance covered at various time\ninstants we have estimated the rate of\nchange of the distance at a given instant\nof time.

We study a few illustrative examples to gain some famil-\niarity with the concept of limits.\nConsider the function f(x) = x2.

The limit of f (x) as x tends\nto zero is to be thought of as the value f (x) should assume at x = 0.\nIn general as x → a, f (x) → l, then l is called limit of the function f  (x) which is\nsymbolically written as () lim\nx af x l\n→=.\nConsider the following function g(x) = |x|, x ≠0. Observe that g (0) is not defined.\nComputing the value of g (x) for values of x very\nnear to 0, we see that the value of g(x) moves\ntowards 0. So, 0lim\nx→ g(x) = 0. This is intuitively\nclear from the graph of y = |x| for x ≠0.\n(See Fig 2.13, Chapter 2).\nConsider the following function.\n( )24, 22xh x xx−= ≠−.\nCompute the value of h(x) for values  of\nx very near to 2 (but not at 2).

Note that there are essentially\ntwo ways x could approach a number a  either from left or from right, i.e., all the\nvalues of x near a could be less than a or could be greater than a. This naturally leads\nto two limits – the right hand limit  and the left hand limit .

BODDINGT ON v\n13.1  Introduction\nWe know that statistics deals with data collected for specific\npurposes. We can make decisions about the data by\nanalysing and interpreting it. In earlier classes, we have\nstudied methods of representing data graphically and in\ntabular form. This representation reveals certain salient\nfeatures or characteristics of the data. We have also studied\nthe methods of finding a representative value for the given\ndata. This value is called the measure of central tendency .\nRecall mean (arithmetic mean), median and mode are three\nmeasures of central tendency . A measur e of central\ntendency  gives us a rough idea where data points are\ncentred. But, in order to make better interpretation from the\ndata, we should also have an idea how the data are scattered or how much they are\nbunched around a measure of central tendency .\nConsider now the runs scored by two batsmen in their last ten matches as follo ws:\nBatsman A :30, 91,  0, 64, 42, 80, 30, 5, 1 17,  71\nBatsman B : 53, 46, 48, 50, 53, 53, 58, 60, 57, 52\nClearly , the mean and median of the data are\nBatsman A Batsman B\nMean 53 53\nMedian 53 53\nRecall that, we calculate the mean of a data (denoted by x) by dividing the sum\nof the observations by the number of observations, i.e.,13 Chapter\nSTATISTICS\nKarl Pearson\n (1857-1936)\n2024-25"

Can we say that the performance of two players is same? Clearly\nNo, because the variability in the scores of batsman A is from 0 (minimum) to 1 17\n(maximum). Whereas, the range of the runs scored by batsman B is from 46 to 60.\nLet us now plot the above scores as dots on a number line. We find the following\ndiagrams:\nFor batsman A\nFor batsman B\nWe can see that the dots corresponding to batsman B are close to each other and\nare clustering around the measure of central tendency (mean and median), while those\ncorresponding to batsman A are scattered or more spread out.\nThus, the measures of central tendency are not sufficient to give complete\ninformation about a given data. Variability is another factor which is required to be\nstudied under statistics. Like ‘ measur es of central tendency ’ we want to have a\nsingle number to describe variability . This single number is called a ‘ measur e of\ndispersion ’. In this Chapter , we shall learn some of the important measures of dispersion\nand their methods of calculation for ungrouped and grouped data.Fig 13.1\nFig 13.2\n2024-25"

There are following measures of\ndispersion:\n(i) Range, (ii) Quartile deviation, (iii) Mean deviation, (iv) Standard deviation.\nIn this Chapter , we shall study all of these measures of dispersion except the\nquartile deviation.\n13.3 Range\nRecall that, in the example of runs scored by two batsmen A and B, we had some idea\nof variability in the scores on the basis of minimum and maximum runs in each series.\nTo obtain a single number for this, we find the dif ference of maximum and minimum\nvalues of each series. This difference is called the ‘Range’ of the data.\nIn case of batsm an A, Range = 1 17 – 0 = 1 17 and for batsman B, Range = 60 – 46 = 14.\nClearly , Range of A > Range of B. Therefore, the scores are scattered or dispersed in\ncase of A while for B these are close to each other .\nThus, Range of a series = Maximum value – Minimum value.\nThe range of data gives us a rough idea of variability or scatter but does not tell\nabout the dispersion of the data from a measure of central tendency . For this purpose,\nwe need some other measure of variability . Clearly , such measure must depend upon\nthe dif ference (or deviation) of the values from the central tendency .\nThe important measures of dispersion, which depend upon the deviations of the\nobservations from a central tendency are mean deviation and standard deviation. Let\nus discuss them in detail.\n13.4 Mean Deviation\nRecall that the deviation of an observation x from a fixed value ‘a’ is the difference\nx – a. In order to find the dispersion of values of x from a central value ‘a’ , we find the\ndeviations about a. An absolute measure of dispersion is the mean of these deviations.\nTo find the mean, we must obtain the sum of the deviations. But, we know that a\nmeasure of central tendency lies between the maximum and the minimum values of\nthe set of observations. Therefore, some of the deviations will be negative and some\npositive. Thus, the sum of deviations may vanish. Moreover , the sum of the deviations\nfrom mean ( x) is zero.\nAlso Mean of deviations Sum of deviations 00\nNumber of observations n= = =\nThus, finding the mean of deviations about  mean is not of any use for us, as far\nas the measure of dispersion is concerned.\n2024-25"

Recall, that the absolute\nvalue of the difference of two numbers gives the distance between the numbers when\nrepresented on a number line. Thus, to find the measure of dispersion from a fixed\nnumber ‘ a’ we may take the mean of the absolute values of the deviations from the\ncentral value. This mean is called the ‘ mean deviation ’. Thus mean deviation about a\ncentral value ‘ a’  is the mean of the absolute values of the deviations of the observations\nfrom ‘ a’. The mean deviation from ‘ a’ is denoted as M.D. ( a).

Thus, the mean deviation\nabout median calculated for such series can not be fully relied.\nThe sum of the deviations from the mean (minus signs ignored) is more than the sum\nof the deviations from median. Therefore, the mean deviation about the mean is not very\nscientific.Thus, in many cases, mean deviation may give unsatisfactory results. Also mean\ndeviation is calculated on the basis of absolute values of the deviations and therefore,\ncannot be subjected to further algebraic treatment. This implies that we must have some\nother measure of dispersion. Standard deviation is such a measure of dispersion.\n13.5 Variance and Standard Deviation\nRecall that while calculating mean deviation about mean or median, the absolute values\nof the deviations were taken. The absolute values were taken to give meaning to the\nmean deviation, otherwise the deviations may cancel among themselves.\nAnother way to overcome this difficulty which arose due to the signs of deviations,\nis to take squares of all the deviations.

This suggests that statistics is as old as human civilisation. In the year 3050\nB.C., perhaps the first census was held in Egypt. In India also, about 2000 years\nago, we had an ef ficient system of collecting administrative statistics, particularly ,\nduring the regime of Chandra Gupta Maurya (324-300 B.C.). The system of\ncollecting data related to births and deaths is mentioned in Kautilya’ s Arthshastra\n(around 300 B.C.) A detailed account of administrative surveys conducted during\nAkbar ’s regime is given in Ain-I-Akbari written by Abul Fazl.\nCaptain John Graunt of London (1620-1674) is known as father of vital\nstatistics due to his studies on statistics of births and deaths. Jacob Bernoulli\n(1654-1705) stated the Law of Large numbers in his book “Ars Conjectandi’,\npublished in 1713.\n2024-25"

The sample space serves as an universal set for all questions concerned\nwith the experiment.\nConsider the experiment of tossing a coin two times. An associated sample space\nis S = {HH, HT , TH, TT}.\nNow suppose that we are interested in those outcomes which correspond to the\noccurrence of exactly one head. We find that HT and TH are the only elements of S\ncorresponding to the occurrence of this happening (event). These two elements form\nthe set  E = { HT , TH}\nWe know that the set E is a subset of the sample space S . Similarly , we find the\nfollowing correspondence between events and subsets of S.\nDescription of events Corresponding subset of ‘S’\nNumber of tails is exactly 2 A = {TT}\nNumber of tails is atleast one B = {HT , TH, TT}\nNumber of heads is atmost one C = {HT , TH, TT}\nSecond toss is not head D = { HT , TT}\nNumber of tails is atmost two S  = {HH, HT , TH, TT}\nNumber of tails is more than two φ\nThe above discussion suggests that a subset of sample space is associated with\nan event and an event is associated with a subset of sample space. In the light of this\nwe define an event as follows.\nDefinition   Any subset E of a sample space S is called an event .14 Chapter\nPROBABILITY\n2024-25"

If actually ‘1’ had appeared on the\ndie then we say that event E has occurred. As a matter of fact if outcomes are 2 or 3,\nwe say that event E has occurred\nThus, the event E of a sample space S is said to have occurred if the outcome\nωof the experiment is such that ω∈ E. If the outcome ω is such that ω ∉ E, we say\nthat the event E has not occurred.\n14.1.2   Types of event s  Events can be classified into various types on the basis  of the\nelements they have.\n1. Impossible and Sure Events   The empty set φ and the sample space S describe\nevents. In fact φ is called an impossible event  and S, i.e., the whole sample space is\ncalled the sure event .\nTo understand these let us consider the experiment of rolling a die. The associated\nsample space is\nS = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}\nLet E be the event “ the number appears on the die is a multiple of 7”. Can you\nwrite the subset associated with the event E?\nClearly no outcome satisfies the condition given in the event, i.e., no element of\nthe sample space ensures the occurrence of the event E. Thus, we say that the empty\nset only correspond to the event E. In other words we can say that it is impossible to\nhave a multiple of 7 on the upper face of the die. Thus, the event E = φ is an impossible\nevent.\nNow let us take up another event F “the number turns up is odd or even”. Clearly\nF = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,} = S, i.e., all outcomes of the experiment ensure the occurrence of\nthe event F . Thus, the event F = S is a sure event.\n2. Simple Event  If an event E has only one sample point of a sample space, it is\ncalled a simple (or elementary ) event .\nIn a sample space containing n distinct elements, there are exactly n simple\nevents.\nFor example in the experiment of tossing two coins, a sample space is\nS={HH, HT , TH, TT}\nThere are four simple events corresponding to this sample space. These are\nE1= {HH}, E2={HT}, E3= { TH} and E4={TT}.\n2024-25"

The subsets of S associated with these events are\nE={HTT ,THT ,TTH}\nF={HTT ,THT , TTH, HHT , HTH, THH, HHH}\nG= {TTT , THT , HTT , TTH}\nEach of the above subsets contain more than one sample point, hence they are all\ncompound events.\n14.1.3  Algebra of event s  In the Chapter on Sets, we have studied about dif ferent\nways of combining two or more sets, viz, union, intersection, difference, complement\nof a set etc. Like-wise we can combine two or more events by using the analogous set\nnotations.\nLet A, B, C be events associated with an experiment whose sample space is S.\n1. Complementar y Event  For every event A, there corresponds another event\nA′called the complementary event to A. It is also called the event ‘not A’.\nFor example, take the experiment ‘of tossing three coins’. An associated sample\nspace is\nS = {HHH, HHT , HTH, THH, HTT , THT, TTH, TTT}\nLet  A={HTH, HHT , THH} be the event ‘only one tail appears’\nClearly for the outcome HTT , the event A has not occurred. But we may say that\nthe event ‘not A’ has occurred. Thus, with every outcome which is not in A, we say\nthat ‘not A’ occurs.\nThus t he complementary event ‘not A\n’ to the event A is\nA′ = {HHH, HTT , THT , TTH, TTT}\nor A′ = {ω : ω ∈ S and ω∉A} = S – A.\n2. The Event ‘A  or B’ Recall that union of two sets A and B denoted by A ∪ B\ncontains all those elements which are either in A  or in B or in both.\nWhen the sets A and B are two events associated with a sample space, then\n‘A ∪ B’ is the event ‘either A or B or both’. This event ‘A  ∪ B’ is also called ‘A  or B’.\nTherefore Event ‘A or B’ = A ∪ B\n={ω : ω ∈ A or ω∈ B}\n2024-25"

It had its origin in the 16th century when an Italian\nphysician and mathematician Jerome Cardan (1501–1576) wrote the first book\non the subject “Book on Games of Chance” (Biber de Ludo Aleae). It was\npublished in 1663 after his death.\nIn 1654, a gambler Chevalier de Metre approached the well known French\nPhilosopher and Mathematician Blaise Pascal (1623–1662) for certain dice\nproblem. Pascal became interested in these problems and discussed with famous\nFrench Mathematician Pierre de Fermat (1601–1665). Both Pascal and Fermat\nsolved the problem independently . Besides, Pascal and Fermat, outstanding\ncontributions to probability theory were also made by Christian Huygenes (1629–\n1665), a Dutchman, J. Bernoulli (1654–1705), De Moivre (1667–1754), a\nFrenchman Pierre Laplace (1749–1827), the Russian P .L Chebyshev (1821–\n1897), A. A Markov (1856–1922) and A. N Kolmogorove (1903–1987).\nKolmogorov is credited with the axiomatic theory of probability . His book\n‘Foundations of Probability’ published in 1933, introduces probability as a set\nfunction and is considered a classic.\n2024-25"
