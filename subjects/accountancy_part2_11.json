In the present chapter, we will take up the next step, namely,  preparation of financial statements, and discuss the types of information requirements of various stakeholders, the distinction between capital and revenue items and its importance and the nature of financial statements and the preparation thereof.\n8.1 Stakeholders and their  \n Information Requirements\nRecall from chapter I (Financial Accounting Part I) \nthat the objective of business is to communicate the meaningful information to various stakeholders in the business so that they can make informed decisions. A stakeholder is any person associated with the business. The stakes of various stakeholders can be monetary or non-monetary. The stakes can be active or passive; or can be direct or indirect. The owner and persons advancing loan to the business would have monetary stake. The government, consumer or a researcher will have non-monetary stake in the business. The stakeholders are also called users who are normally classified as internal \nand external depending upon whether they are inside \nthe business or outside the business. All users have different objectives for  joining business and \nCh-8.indd   277 9/13/2022   2:49:08 PM\n2024-25"

In nutshell, \nthe various users have diverse financial information requirements from the business.\nFor example we have classified the following into the category of internal \nand external users specifying their objectives and consequent information requirements.\nName\t Internal/\t Objective \tfor\tparticipating\t Accounting \tInformation \trequirements\n External  in business\n users\nCurrent  Internal   To make investment in the  Likes  to know extent of profit in the  \nowners   business and wealth grow.  last accounting period, current  \n   position of the assets/liabilities of the \n   business.\nManager  Internal  For a career.

Only those transactions are recorded which are \nmeasured in money terms. The system followed for recording is called double entry \nsystem whereby two aspects (debit and credit) of every transaction are recorded. Repeated transactions of same nature are recorded in subsidiary books, also called special journals. Instead of recording all transactions in journal, they are recorded in subsidiary books and the  journal proper. For example, the business would record all credit sales in sales book and all credit purchases in purchases book. The other examples of subsidiary books are return inwards book, return outwards book. An other important special book is cash book, in which all cash and bank transactions are recorded. The entries, which are not recorded in any of these books, are recorded in a residual journal called\n\tjournal\tproper .\n3. The entries appearing in the above books are posted in the respective accounts in the ledger.\n4. The accounts are balanced and listed in a statement called trial balance . If the \ntotal amounts of debit and credit balances agree, accounts are taken as free from arithmetical errors. \n5. The trial balance forms the basis for making the financial statements, i.e. trading \nand profit and loss account and balance sheet.\n8.2 Distinction between Capital and Revenue\nA very important distinction in accounting is between capital and revenue \nitems. The distinction has important implications for making of the trading and profit and loss account and balance sheet. The revenue items form part of  the trading and profit and loss account, the capital items help in the preparation of a balance sheet.\n8.2.1 Expenditure\nWhenever payment and/or incurrence of an outlay are made for a purpose \nother than the settlement of an existing liability, it is called expenditure. The expenditures are incurred with a viewpoint they would give benefits to the business. The benefit of an expenditure may extend up to one accounting year or more than one year. If the benefit of expenditure extends up to one accounting period, it is termed as \nrevenue \texpenditure . Normally, they are \nincurred for the day-to-day conduct of the business. An example can be payment of salaries, rent, etc. The salaries paid in the current period will not benefit the business in the next accounting period, as the workers have put in their efforts in the current accounting period. They will have to be paid the salaries in the next accounting period as well if they are made to work. If the \nbenefit of expenditure extends more than one accounting period, it is termed  \nCh-8.indd   279 9/13/2022   2:49:09 PM\n2024-25"

                "text": "280\nAccountancy\nas capital expenditure. An example can be payment to acquire furniture for use \nin the business. Furniture acquired in the current accounting period will give \nbenefits for many accounting periods to come. The usual examples of capital expenditure can be payment to acquire fixed assets and/or to make additions/extensions in the fixed assets.\nFollowing points of distinction between capital expenditure and revenue \nexpenditure are worth noting :\n (a) Capital expenditure increases earning capacity of business whereas \nrevenue expenditure is incurred to maintain the earning capacity.\n (b) Capital expenditure is incurred to acquire fixed assets for operation of business whereas revenue expenditure is incurred on day-to-day conduct of business. \n (c) Revenue ex  penditure is generally recurring expenditure and capital \nexpendi  ture is non-recurring by nature.\n (d) Capital expenditure benefits more than one accounting year whereas \nrevenue expenditure normally benefits one accounting year.\n (e) Capital expenditure (subject to depreciation) is re  corded in balance sheet \nwhereas revenue expenditure (subject to adjustment for outstanding and prepaid amount) is transferred to trading and profit and loss account.\nSometimes, it becomes difficult to classify  the expenditure into revenue or \ncapital category. In normal usage, the advertising expenditure is termed as revenue expenditure. The heavy expenditure incurred on advertising is likely to benefit the business firm for more than one accounting period. Such revenue expenditures, which are likely to give benefit for more than one accounting period, are termed as \ndeferred \trevenue \texpenditure .\nIt must be understood that expenditure is a wider term and includes \nexpenses. Expenditure is any outlay made/incurred by the business firm. The part of the expenditure, which is perceived to have been used or consumed in the current year, is termed as expense of the current year.\nRevenue expenditure is treated as an expense for the current year and \nis shown in trading and profit and loss account. For example, salary paid by the business firm is treated as an expense of the current year. Capital expenditures are charged to income statement and are spread over to more than one accounting period. Hence, furniture of ` 50,000 if expected to be used \nfor 5 years will be treated as expense @ ` 10,000 per year. The name given for \nthe expense is depreciation. The treatment of deferred revenue expenditure is same as of capital expenditure. They are also written-off over their expected period of benefit.\nCh-8.indd   280 9/13/2022   2:49:09 PM\n2024-25"

                "text": "281 \nFinancial Statements - I\n8.2.2 Receipts\nThe similar treatment is given to the receipts of the business. If the receipts \nimply an obligation to return the money, these are capital receipts. The example can be an additional capital brought in by the owner or a loan taken from the bank. Both receipts are leading to obligations, the first to the owner (called  \nequity) and the other to the outsiders (called liabilities). Another example on a capital receipt can be the sale of a fixed asset like old machinery or furniture. However, if a receipt does not incur an obligation to return the money or is  \nnot in the form of a sale of fixed asset, it is termed as revenue receipt. The  \nexamples of revenue receipts sales made by the firm and interest on investment received by the firm.\n8.2.3 Importance of Distinction between Capital and Revenue\nAs stated earlier, the distinction between capital and revenue items has  \nimportant implications for the preparation of trading and profit and loss  \naccount and the balance sheet as all items of revenue value are to the shown \nin the trading and profit and loss account and the items of capital nature in  \nthe balance sheet. If any item is wrongly classified, i.e. if any item of revenue nature is treated as capital item or vice-versa, the ascertainment of profit or  \nloss will be incorrect. For example, the revenues earned during an accounting period are ` 10,00,000 and the expenses shown are ` 8,00,000, the profit \nshall work out as ` 2,00,000. On scrutiny of the details, you find that a  \nrevenue item of ` 20,000 (an expenditure on repairs of machinery) has been \ntreated as capital expenditure (added to the cost of machinery and debited to machinery account, not to repairs account), and hence, does not form part of the expenses for the period. It means the actual expenses for the period are  \n` 8,20,000 and not ` 8,00,000. So, the correct profit is ` 1,80,000, not  \n` 2,00,000. In other words, the profit has been over stated. Similarly, if any capital expenditure is wrongly shown as revenue expenditure (for example, purchase of furniture shown as purchases), it will result in under statement  \nof profits, and also an under statement of assets. Thus, the financial statements will not reflect the true and fair view of the affairs of the business. Hence, it is necessary to identify the correct nature of each item and treat it accordingly  \nin the book of accounts. It is also important from taxation point of view because capital profits are taxed differently from revenue profits.\n8.3 Financial Statements\nIt has been emphasised that various users have diverse informational \nrequirements. Instead of generating particular information useful for specific users, the business prepares a set of financial statements, which in general \nsatisfies the informational needs of the users.\nCh-8.indd   281 9/13/2022   2:49:09 PM\n2024-25"

Balance Sheet shows financial position in the form of assets, liabilities and capital. These are prepared on the basis of trial balance and additional information, if any.\nExample \t1\nObserve the following trial balance of Ankit and signify correctly the various elements of accounts and you will notice that the debit balances represent either assets or expenses/losses and the credit balance represent either equity/liabilities or revenue/gains.[This trial balance of Ankit will be used throughout the chapter to understand the process of preparation of financial statements]\nTrial Balance of Ankit as on March 31, 2017\n Account Title  L.F.

It is basically a summary of revenues and expenses of the business and calculates the net figure termed as profit or loss. Profit is revenue less expenses. If expenses \nare more than revenues, the figure is termed as loss. Trading and Profit and Loss \naccount summarises the performance for an accounting period. It is achieved by transferring the balances of revenues and expenses to the trading and profit and loss account from the trial balance. Trading and Profit and Loss account is also an account with Debit and Credit sides. It can be observed that debit \nbalances (representing expenses) and losses are transferred to the debit side of the Trading and a Profit and Loss account and credit balance (representing revenues/gains) are transfered to its credit side.\n8.4.1 Relevant Items in Trading and Profit and Loss Account\nThe different items appearing in the trading and profit and loss account are \nexplained hereunder:\nItems\ton\tthe\tdebit\tside\n (i)\t Opening \tstock\t: It is the stock of goods in hand at the beginning of the \naccounting year.

In the trading account it appears on the \ndebit side because it forms the part of cost of goods sold for the current accounting year.\n (ii) Purchases less returns : Goods, which have been bought for resale appears \nas purchases on the debit side of the trading account. They include both cash as well as credit purchases. Goods which are returned to suppliers are termed as purchases return. It is shown by way of deduction from purchases and the computed amount is known as Net purchases.\n (iii) Wages : Wages refer to renumeration paid to workers who are directly \nengaged in factory for loading, unloading and production of goods and are debited to trading account.\n (iv)\t Carriage \tinwards/Freight \tinwards: \tThese expenses are the items of \ntransport expenses, which are incurred on bringing materials/goods purchased to the place of business.

However, the packing refers to the big containers that are used for transporting the goods and is regarded as an indirect expense debited to profit and loss account.\n (vii) Salaries  : These include salaries paid to the administration, godown \nand warehouse staff for the services rendered by them for running the business. If salaries are paid in kind by providing certain facilities (called perks) to the employees such as rent free accommodation, meals, uniform, medical facilities should also be regarded as salaries and  debited to the profit and loss account.\n (viii) Rent paid : These include office and godown rent, municipal rates and \ntaxes, factory rent, rates and taxes. The amount of rent paid is shown on the debit side of the profit and loss account.\n (ix)\t Interest \tpaid\t: Interest paid on loans, bank overdraft, renewal of bills of \nexchange, etc. is an expense and is debited to profit and loss account.\n (x)\t Commission \tpaid:\tCommission paid or payable on business transactions \nundertaken through the agents is an item of expense and is debited to profit and loss account.\nCh-8.indd   284 9/13/2022   2:49:09 PM\n2024-25"

Purchases is one of the main constituents of expenses in business organisation. Besides purchases, the remaining expenses are divided into two categories, viz. direct expenses and indirect expenses. \nDirect expenses  means all expenses directly connected with the manufacture, \npur chase of goods and bringing them to the point of sale. Direct expenses \ninclude carriage inwards, freight inwards, wages, factory lighting, coal, water and feul, royalty on production, etc. In our example-1, besides purchases, four more items of expenses are listed. These are wages, salaries, rent of building and bad debts.  Out of these items, wages is treated as direct expense while \nthe other three are treated as indirect expenses. \nSimilarly, sales constitute the main item of revenue for the business. The \nexcess of sales over purchases and direct expenses is called \ngross\tprofit .  If the \namount of purchases including direct expenses is more than the sales revenue, the resultant figure is gross loss. The computation of gross profit can be shown \nin the form of equation as :\nGross Profit = Sales – (Purchases + Direct Expenses)\nThe gross profit or the gross loss is transferred to profit and loss account.\nThe indirect expenses are transferred to the debit side of the second part, \nviz. profit and loss account. All revenue/gains other than sales are transferred \nto the credit side of the profit and loss account. If the total of the credit side \nof the profit and loss account is more than the total of the debit side, the difference is the \nnet\tprofit  for the period of which it is being prepared. On the \nother hand, if the total of the debit side is more than the total of the credit side, the difference is the net loss  incurred by the business firm. In an equation \nform, it is shown as follows :\nNet Profit = Gross Profit + Other Incomes – Indirect Expenses\nNet profit or net loss so computed is transferred to the capital account in \nthe balance sheet by way of the following entry :\n (i) For\ttransfer \tof\tnet\tprofit\nProfit and Loss A/c  Dr.\n To Capital A/c\n (ii) For transfer of net loss\nCapital A/c  Dr.\n To Profit and Loss A/c\nWe are now redrafting the trading and profit and loss account to show gross profit \nand net profit of Ankit for the year ended March 31, 2017.

In our example, notice that purchases \namount to ` 75,000 and wages amounts to ` 8,000. Hence, the cost of goods \nsold will be computed using the following formula :\n Cost of Goods Sold = Purchases + Direct Expenses\n = `75,000 + ` 8,000\n = ` 83,000\nAs there is no unsold stock, the presumption here is that all the goods \npurchased have been sold. But in practice, there is  some unsold goods at the \nend of the accounting period.\nIn our example, let us assume that out of the goods purchased amounting \nto ` 75,000 in the current year, Ankit is able to sell goods costing ` 60,000 only. \nIn such a situation, the business will have an unsold stock of goods costing ` 15,000 in hand, also called closing stock. The amount of cost of goods sold will be computed as per the following equation :\n Cost of Goods Sold = Purchases + Direct Expenses – Closing Stock\n  = ` 75,000 + ` 8,000 – ` 15,000\nAs a result, the amount of gross profit will also change with the existence \nof closing stock in business from ` 42,000 (as computed in figure 8.4) to  \n` 57,000 (refer figure 8.5).\nTrading Account of Ankit\nfor the year ended March 31, 2017\nExpenses/Losses\t Amount  Revenues/Gains\t Amount\n `  `\nPurchases   75,000   Sales       1,25,000  \nWages   8,000   Closing stock   15,000  \nGross profit c/d   57,000      \n  1,40,000     1,40,000  \nSalaries   25,000   Gross profit b/d   57,000  \nRent of building   13,000   Commission received   5,000  \nBad debts   4,500      \n Net Profit   (transfered to  19,500      \ncapital account)\n  62,000     62,000  \nFig. 8.5 : The trading account of Ankit\nCh-8.indd   294 9/13/2022   2:49:09 PM\n2024-25"

It is called balance sheet because it is a statement of balances of ledger accounts that have not been transferred to trading and profit and loss account and are to be carried forward to the next year with the help of an opening entry made in the journal at the  beginning of the next year.\n8.6.1 Preparing Balance Sheet\nAll the account of assets, liabilities and capital are shown in the balance \nsheet. Accounts of capital and liabilities are shown on the left hand side, known as Liabilities.  Assets and other debit balances are shown on the right \nhand side, known as Assets. There is no prescribed form of Balance sheet, \nfor a proprietary and partnership firms. (However, \nSchedule \tIII\tPart\tI\tof\tthe\t\nCompanies \tAct\t2013  prescribes the format and the order in which the assets \nand liabilities of a company should be shown).

These are the accounts of revenues and expenses. The analysis of figure 8.3 shows that the business has incurred total expenses of ` 1,25,500 and revenues generated are  \n` 1,30,000 making a profit of ` 4,500. The remaining \nseven\titems  in the trial \nbalance reflects the capital, assets and liabilities.

The examples of such assets are cash in hand/bank, bills receivable, stock of raw materials, semi-finished goods and finished goods, sundry debtors, short term investments, prepaid expenses, etc.\nCh-8.indd   301 9/13/2022   2:49:09 PM\n2024-25"

                "text": "302\nAccountancy\n  (2) Current Liabilities : Current liabilities are those liabilities which are \nexpected to be paid within a year and which are usually to be paid out of \ncurrent assets. The examples of such liabilities are bank overdraft, bills payable, sundry creditors, short-term loans, outstanding expenses, etc.\n (3) Fixed Assets:  Fixed assets are those assets, which are held on a long-term \nbasis in the business. Such assets are not acquired for the purpose of resale, e.g. land, building, plant and machinery, furniture and fixtures, etc. Some times the term ‘Fixed  Block’ or ‘Block Capital’ is also used for them.\n (4)\t Intangible \tAssets\t:\tThese are such assets which cannot be seen or touched.\n  Goodwill, Patents, Trademarks are some of the examples of intangible assets.\n (5) Investments: Investments represent the funds invested in government securities, shares of a company, etc. They are shown at cost price. If, on the date of preparation the balance sheet, the market price of investments is lower than the cost price, a footnote to that effect may be appended to the balance sheet.\n (6) Long-term \tLiabilities \t: All liabilities other than the current liabilities are \nknown as long-term liabilities. Such liabilities are usually payable after one year of the date of the balance sheet. The important items of long term liabilities are long-term loans from bank and other financial institutions.\n (7) Capital: It is the excess of assets over liabilities due to outsiders. It represents the amount originally contributed by the proprietor/ partners as increased by profits and interest on capital and decreased by losses drawings and intrest on drawings.\n (8) Drawings : Amount withdrawn by the proprietor is termed as drawings and  \nhas the effect of reducing the balance on his capital account. Therefore, the drawings account is closed by transferring its balance to his capital account. However it is shown by way of deduction from capital in the balance sheet.\n8.6.3 Marshalling and Grouping of Assets and Liabilities\nA major concern of accounting is about preparing and presenting the financial \nstatement. The information so provided should be decision useful for the users. Therefore, it becomes necessary that the items appearing in the balance sheet should be properly grouped and presented in a particular order.\nMarshalling of Assets and Liabilities\nIn a balance sheet, the assets and liabilities are arranged either in the order \nof liquidity  or permanence. Arrangement of assets and liabilities in a particular \norder is known as Marshalling.\nIn case of permanence, the most permanent asset or liability is put on the \ntop in the balance sheet and thereafter the assets are arranged in their reducing \nlevel of permanence.\nCh-8.indd   302 9/13/2022   2:49:09 PM\n2024-25"

                "text": "303 \nFinancial Statements - I\nIn the balance sheet of Ankit you will find that furniture is the most \npermanent of all the assets. Out of debtors, bank and cash, debtors will take \nmaximum time to convert back into cash. Bank is less liquid than cash. Cash is the most liquid of all the assets. Similarly, on the liabilities side, the capital, being the most important source of finance will tend to remain in the business for a longer period than the long-term loan. Creditors being a liquid liability will be discharged in the near future. The balance sheet of Ankit in the order of permanence is shown in figure 8.10(a).\nBalance Sheet of Ankit as on March 31, 2017 (in order of permanence)\nLiabilities \t\t \t Amount \t\t Assets \t\t Amount\t\n  `  `\nCapital  12,000    Furniture   15,000  \nAdd Profit   4,500   16,500   Debtors   15,500  \n10 % Long-term loan    5,000   Bank   5,000  \nCreditors    15,000   Cash   1,000  \n  36,500     36,500  \nFig. 8.10 (a) :  Items\tof\tbalance \tsheet\tshown\tin\tthe\torder\tof\tpermanance\nIn case of liquidity , the order is reversed.

The \npreparation of simple final accounts pre-supposes the absence of any accounting complexities which are normal to business operations. These complexities arise due to the fact that the process of determining income and financial position is based on the accrual basis of accounting. This emphasises that while ascertaining the profitability, the revenues be considered on earned basis and not on receipt basis, and the expenses be considered on incurred basis and not on paid basis. Hence, many items need some adjustment while preparing the financial statements. In this chapter we shall discuss all items which require adjustments and the way these are brought into the books of account and incorporated in the final accounts.\n9.1 Need for Adjustments\nAccording to accrual concept of accounting, the \nprofit or loss for an accounting year is not based on the revenues realised in cash and the expenses paid in cash during that year. There may exist some receipts and expenses in the current year which partially relate to the previous year or to the next year. Also, there may exist incomes and expenses relating to the current year that still need to be brought into books of account. Such items duly adjusted, the final accounts will not reflect the true and fair view of the state of affairs of the business.Learning  Objectives\nAfter studying this chapter, \nyou will be able to :\n•\t describe \tthe\tneed\tfor\t\nadjustments while \npreparing \tthe\tfinancial\t\nstatements;\n•\t explain \tthe\taccounting \t\ntreatment of adj  ust ­\nments for outstanding \nand\tprepaid\texpenses, \t\naccrued and advance \nreceipts of incomes;\n•\t discuss \tthe\tadjust\t-\t\nments to be made re ­\ngarding deprecia ­ tion, \nbad debts, provi  sion \nfor doubtful debts, pro ­\nvision for discount on debtors;\n•\t explain \tthe\tconcepts\t\nand adjustment of \nmanager’s commiss  ion \nand interest on capital;\n•\t prepare \tprofit\tand\tloss\t\naccount and balance \nsheet with adjust ­ \nm ents.\nCh-09.indd   318 9/13/2022   5:00:26 PM\n2024-25"

                "text": "319 \nFinancial Statements - II\nFor example, an amount of ` 1,200 paid on July 01, 2016 towards insurance \npremium. Any general insurance premium paid usually covers a period of 12 \nmonths. Suppose the accounting year ends on March 31, 2017, it would mean \nthat one fourth of the insurance premium is paid on July 01, 2016 relate to the next accounting year 2017-18. Therefore, while preparing the financial statements for 2016-17, the expense on insurance premium that should be debited to the profit and loss account is ` 900 (` 1,200 – ` 300).\nLet us take another example. The salaries for the month of March, 2017 were \npaid on April 07, 2017. This means that the salaries account of 2016-17 does not include the salaries for the month of March 2017. Such unpaid salaries is termed as salaries outstanding which have to be brought into books of account \nand is debited to profit and loss account along with the salaries already paid for the month of April, 2016 up to Feburary, 2017.\nSimilarly, adjustments may also become necessary in respect of certain \nincomes received in advance or those which have accrued but are still to be received. Apart from these, there are certain items which are not recorded on day-to-day basis such as depreciation on fixed assets, interest on capital, etc. These are adjusted at the time of preparing financial statements. The purpose of making various adjustments is to ensure that the final accounts reveal the true profit or loss and the true financial position of the business. The items which usually need adjustments are:\n 1. Closing stock\n 2. Outstanding/expenses\n 3. Prepaid/Unexpired expenses\n 4. Accrued income\n 5. Income received in advance\n 6. Depreciation\n 7. Bad debts\n 8. Provision for doubtful debts\n 9. Provision for discount on debtors\n 10. Manager’s commission   \n 11. Interest on capital\nIt may be noted that when we prepare the financial statements, we are \nprovided with the trial balance and some other additional information in respect of the adjustments to be made. All adjustments are reflected in the final accounts at two places to complete the double entry. Our earlier example in chapter 8 (Page no. 294) which represents the trial balance of Ankit is reproduced in figure 9.1:\nCh-09.indd   319 9/13/2022   5:00:26 PM\n2024-25"

Such items usually are wages, salaries, interest on loan, etc.\nWhen expenses of an accounting period remain unpaid at the end of an \naccounting period, they are termed as \noutstanding \texpenses . As they relate to \nthe earning of revenue during the current accounting year, it is logical that they should be duly charged against revenue for computation of the correct amount of profit or loss. The entry to bring such expenses into account is :\nConcerned expense A/c   Dr.\n To Outstanding expense A/c\nThe above entry opens a new account called Outstanding \tExpenses  which is \nshown on the liabilities side of the balance sheet. The amount of outstanding expenses is added to the total of expenses under a particular head for the purpose of preparing trading and profit and loss account. \nFor example, refer to Ankit’s trial balance (refer figure 10.1). You will notice \nthat wages are shown at ` 8,000. Let us assume that Ankit owes `500 as \nwages relating to the year 2016-17 to one of his employees. In that case, the correct expense on wages amounts to ` 8,500 instead of ` 8,000. Ankit must \nshow ` 8,500 as expense on account of wages in the trading and profit and \nloss account and recognise a current liability of ` 500 towards the sum owed \nto his staff. It will be referred to as wages outstanding and it  will be adjusted \nto wages account by recording the following journal entry:\nWages A/c  Dr. 500\n To Wages outstanding A/c    500\nCh-09.indd   322 9/13/2022   5:00:26 PM\n2024-25"

It is treated as a business expense and is debited to profit and loss account. This, in effect, \namounts to writing-off a portion of the cost of an asset which has been used in the business for the purpose of earning profits. The entry for providing depreciation is :\nDepreciation A/c  Dr.\n To Concerned asset A/c\nIn the balance sheet, the asset will be shown at cost minus the amount of \ndepreciation. For example, the trial balance in our example shows that Ankit has a furniture account with a balance of ` 15,000. Let us assume that furniture \nis subject to a depreciation of 10% per annum. This implies that Ankit must recognise that at the end of the year the value attached to furniture is to be reduced  by ` 1,500 ( ` 15,000 × 10%). Ankit needs to record an adjustment \nentry to give effect to depreciation on furniture as follows :\nDepreciation A/c  Dr. 1,500\n To Furniture A/c    1,500\nDepreciation will be shown in the profit and loss account and balance sheet \nas follows :\nTrading and Profit and Loss Account of Ankit  \nfor the year ended March 31, 2017\nDr. Cr.\nExpenses/Losses \t\t \t Amount \t\t Revenues/Gains \t\t \t Amount \t\n  `   `\nPurchases    75,000   Sales        1,25, 000 \nWages  8,000    Closing stock    15,000  \nAdd Outstanding wages  (500 )  8,500  \nGross Profit c/d    56,500  \n   1,40,000      1,40,000  \nSalaries  25,000    Gross profit b/d    56,500  \nLess Prepaid salary  (5,000  )  20,000  \nRent of building     13,000   Commission  received  5,000   6,500  \n   Add Accrued  1,500  \nDepreciation-Furniture   1,500          Commission  \nBad debts    4,500      \nNet profit (transferred to    24,000  \nAnkit’s capital account)      \n   63,000      63,000  \nNotice that the amount of net profit declines with the adjustment of depreciation. \nLet us now see how depreciation as an expense will be shown in balance sheet.\nCh-09.indd   328 9/13/2022   5:00:27 PM\n2024-25"

It is  regarded as a loss and is termed as bad debt. The entry for \nrecording bad debt is: \nBad debts A/c  Dr.\n To Debtors A/c\nYou will notice in Ankit’s trial balance, that it contains bad debts amounting \nto ` 4,500. Whereas, the sundry debtors of Ankit are reported as ` 15,500. The \nexistence of bad debts in the trial balance signifies that Ankit has incurred a loss arising out of  bad debts during the year and which has been already recorded in the books of account.\nHowever, assuming one of his debtors who owed him ` 2,500 had become \ninsolvent, and nothing is receivable from him. But the amount of bad debts related to the current year is still to be account for. This fact appears as additional information and is termed as further bad debts. The adjustment \nentry to be recorded for the amount will be as follows. For this purpose, Ankit needs to record an adjustment entry as under :\nBad debts A/c  Dr. 2,500\n To Debtors A/c    2,500\nThis entry will reduce the value of debtors to ` 13,000( ` 15,500 –  \n` 2,500) and increases the amount of bad debts to ` 7,000 ( ` 4,500 +  \n` 2,500).\nCh-09.indd   329 9/13/2022   5:00:27 PM\n2024-25"

In such a situation, interest is calculated at a given rate of interest on capital as at the beginning of the accounting year. If however, any additional capital is brought during the year, the interest may also be computed on such amount from the date on which it was brought into the business. Such interest is treated as expense for the business and the following journal entry is recorded in the books of account:\nInterest on capital A/c  Dr.\n  To Capital A/c\nIn the final accounts, it is shown as an expense on the debit side of the \nprofit and loss account and added to capital in the balance sheet. \nLet us assume, Ankit decides to provide 5% interest on his capital. This \nshall amount to ` 600 for which the following journal entry will be recorded:\nInterest on capital A/c  Dr. 600\nTo Capital A/c   600\nThis implies that net profit shall be reduced by ` 600. As a result, the \nreduced amount of profit shall be added to the capital in the balance sheet. \nCh-09.indd   338 9/13/2022   5:00:28 PM\n2024-25"

                "text": "APPENDIX\nDescription of Commonly Used Functions in Access\nThere are three types of functions that are used to set the Control Source property \nof calculated controls and/or to form part of calculated field expression in SQL statement. A brief description of the commonly used functions is below :\nA-1. Domain Aggregate Functions\nThese functions are used to perform calculations based on values in a field of a table \nor query. Criteria to select the set of records in the table or query that is desired to be used for calculations may also be specified. The criteria, if not specified, imply that all the records of the table or query specific to the field are used for computation. All the domain aggregate functions use the same syntax as is given hereunder :\nDFunction (“FldName”, “TblName” or “QryName”, “SrchCond”)Wherein DFunction refers to a named domain aggregate function. A brief description of its input arguments is given below:FldName : It refers to the name of field that is to be searched in a table or query, which is specified as an argument.TblName (or QueryName) : It refers to the name of a table or query that contains the field specified as second input argument.SrchCond : It refers to the search condition on the basis of which the relevant record is searched.Some of the important domain aggregate functions have been described as below :\n(a) DLookup : This function is meant to look up information that is stored \nin a table or query, which is not the underlying source of Access Form or Report. It is used to set the Control Source property of a calculated control to display data from other table or query. Consider the following example:\nDLookup (“Name”, “Accounts”, “Code = ‘110001’”)\nIn the above example, this function has been applied to search the name of  \naccount (in Accounts table) whose code is ‘110001’.\n(b) DMax and DMin : These functions are used to retrieve respectively the \nmaximum and minimum values in the specified field. Consider the following example :\n DMin (“Amount”, “Vouchers”, “Debit = ‘711001’”)\n Dmax (“Amount”, “Vouchers”, “Debit = ‘711001’”)\n In the above examples, the amount of minimum purchase transaction and \nmaximum purchase transaction is retrieved and reported. It may also be noted that ‘711001’ is the code of Purchase account in Accounts table\n(c) DSum : This function computes and returns the sum of the values in the \nspecified field or expression. For Example, in a table : Sales that contains \nAppendix.indd   383 9/13/2022   5:21:40 PM\n2024-25"

                "text": "384\nAccountancy \nItemCode, Price and Quantity as fields, the total amount of sales may be \ncomputed by using the DSum () function as follows :\n DSum (“Price*Quantity”, “Sales”)\n However, if the total sales is to computed for a particular item coded as \n1678, the DSum () function shall be applied as follows :\n DSum (“Price*Quantity”, “Sales”, “ItemCode = 1678”)\n(d) DFirst and DLast : These functions are used to retrieve respectively the \nvalues in the specified field from first and last physical records.\n Consider the following application examples :\n DFirst (“Name”, “Accounts”)\n DLast (“Name”, “Accounts”)\n In the above examples, the name first and last account that physically exists \nin Accounts table is retrieved and reported.\n(e) DCount : This function is meant to compute the number of records with \nnon-null values in the specified field. Consider the following application \nexample :\n DCount (“*”, “Accounts”)\n In the above example, The number of records in accounts table are counted \nand reported by DCount () function.\nA-2. SQL Aggregate Functions\nThe SQL aggregate functions have the functionality similar to that of domain \naggregate function. However, unlike domain aggregate functions, these functions cannot be called directly into controls used in Forms and Reports of Access. These functions are used in SQL statements that provide the underlying record source of Forms and Reports. All these functions, when used require the GROUP BY clause in SQL statement :\n(a) Sum : This function is used to compute and return the sum of a set of values. For \nExample, consider the following SQL statement that has been used in Chapter-V to prepare the underlying information source of Trial Balance (Model-I.).\n SELECT Debit As Code, SUM (Amount) AS Total\n FROM VOUCHERS\n GROUP BY Debit ;\n In the above SQL statement, Sum () has been used to compute the total amount \nby which the transacted accounts have beeen debited.\n(b) Min and Max : These functions are used to retrieve respectively the minimum \nand maximum of value set with respect to field or query expression. For Example, the following SQL statement is capable of returning the amount of minimum and maximum sales transaction in Model-I :\nSELECT Min (Amount) As MinSales, Max (Amount) As MaxSalesFROM Vouchers\nWHERE Credit = ‘811001’ ;\nAppendix.indd   384 9/13/2022   5:21:40 PM\n2024-25"

                "text": "385 \nAppendix\n It may be noted that the sales account that is coded as ‘811001’ is credited as \nand when a sales transaction is recorded.\n(c) Count : This function counts the number of records returned by a query. The \nnumber of times a sales transaction has occurred and recorded in books of \naccounts can be known by executing the following SQL statement.\n SQL statement.\n SELECT count (*)\n FROM Vouchers\n WHERE Credit = ‘811001’\n In the above SQL statement, the Credit field stores the account code of sales \nwhen a sales transaction occurs. The WHERE clause restricts the number of records returned by the above SQL to those in which credit field has the account code of sales. Accordingly, the count () function returns the count value of records returned by the above SQL statement.\n(d) First and Last : These functions are meant to retrieve the first and last record \nof a value set pertaining to a field or query expression.\nA-3. Other Functions\n(a) IIF : The purpose of this function is to provide a value to the field from a mutually \nexclusive set of values. Its syntax is as given below :\n IIIF (<Condition>, Value-1, Value-2)\n Wherein <Condition> refers to any logical expression in which a comparison is \nmade by using following comparison operators :\n = equal to\n <less than\n >greater than\n <= less than or equal to\n >= greater than or equal to\n The condition formed by the above comparison operators is evaluated to result \ninto TRUE or FALSE.\n <Value-1> This value is returned by IIF() function to the field, if the condition \nturns out to be TRUE\n <Value-2> This value is returned by IIF() function to the field, if the condition \nturns out to be FALSE\n Example : Suppose a field Type is to return the string of characters “Debit” \nwhen its value is 0 and “Credit” when its value is 1, IIF() function is used as shown below :\n IIF (Type = 0, “Debit”, “Credit”)\n(b) Abs : The purpose of this function is to return absolute value, This function \nreceives a numeric value as its input argument and returns an absolute value.\n Consider the following examples on use of Abs ( ) function :\n When – 84 is given as input argument to Abs(– 84), it returns 84\n When 84 is given as input argument to Abs(84), it returns 84\nAppendix.indd   385 9/13/2022   5:21:40 PM\n2024-25"

Its Syntax is Val(string)\n The string argument of the above Val( ) function is any valid string expression. \nThe Val( ) function stops reading the string at the first character that cannot be \nrecognised as number. For example, Val(“12431”) returns the value 12431 by converting the enclosed string of numerals into value. However, Val (“12,431”) returns the numeric value 12 because comma after 12 in the enclosed string of characters in Val ( ) function is not recognised as number.\nAppendix.indd   386 9/13/2022   5:21:40 PM\n2024-25"
