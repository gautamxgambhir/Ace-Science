A financial decision of this magnitude has significant implicitness for both Tata Steel and Corus as well as their employees and shareholders. To mention some of them:\n�\tTata Steel raised a debt of over $8 billion to finance the transaction. The deal will be paid for by Tata Steel UK, a special purpose vehicle (SPV) set up for the purpose. Another company of the Tata group, Tata Sons Ltd., invested $ 1 billion dollars for preference shares along with Tata Steel which will invest an equal amount. \n�\tTata Steel, the acquirer company, arranged about 36,500 crores of rupees to finance the take-over.\n�\tTata Steel raised this amount through debt or equity or a combination of both. Some amount came from internal accruals also.

It is quite imperative that it needs to be carefully managed. Financial Management is concerned with optimal procurement as well as the usage of finance. For optimal procurement, different available sources of finance are identified and compared in terms of their costs and associated risks. Similarly, the finance so procured needs to be invested in a manner that the returns from the investment exceed the cost at which procurement has taken place. Financial Management aims at reducing the cost of funds procured, keeping the risk under control and achieving effective deployment of such funds. It also aims at ensuring availability of enough funds whenever required as well as avoiding idle finance. Needless to emphasise, the future of a business depends a great deal on the quality of its financial management.Importance: The role of financial management cannot be over-emphasised, since it has a direct bearing on the financial health of a business. The financial statements, such as Balance Sheet and Profit and Loss Account, reflect a firm’s financial position and its financial health. Almost all items in the financial statements of a business are affected directly or indirectly through some financial management decisions. Some inTroducTion\nIn the above case, these decisions \nrequire careful financial planning, an understanding of the resultant capital structure and the riskiness and profitability of the enterprise. All these have a bearing on shareholders as well as employees. They require an understanding of business finance, major financial decision areas, financial risk, and working capital requirements of the business. Finance, as we all know, is essential for running a business. Success of business depends on how well finance is invested in assets and operations and how timely and cheaply the finances are arranged, from outside or from within the business.  \nMeaning  oF BuSineSS  Finance\nMoney required for carrying out business activities is called business finance. Almost all business activities require some finance. Finance is needed to establish a business, to run it, to modernise it, to expand, or diversify it. It is required for buying a variety of assets, which may be tangible like machinery, factories, buildings, offices; or intangible such as trademarks, patents, technical expertise, etc. Also, finance is central to running the day-to-day operations of business, like buying material, paying bills, salaries, collecting cash from customers, etc. needed at every stage in the life of a business entity. Availability of adequate finance is, \nCh_9.indd   216 10-08-2022   09:09:51\n2024-25"

The quantum of current assets is also influenced by financial management decisions. In addition, decisions about credit and inventory management affect the amount of \ndebtors and inventory which in turn affect the total current assets as well as their composition.\n(\n iii) The amount of long-ter\nm and \nshort- term funds to be used:  \nFinancial management, among \nothers, involves decision about the proportion of long-term and short-term funds. An organisation wanting to have more liquid assets would raise relatively more amount on a long-term basis. There is a choice between liquidity and profitability. The underlying assumption here is that current liabilities cost less than long term liabilities.\n(\n iv) Break-\nup of long-term financing into \ndebt, equity etc: Of the total long- \nterm finance, the proportions to be raised by way of debt and/or equity \nis also a financial management decision. The amounts of debt, equity share capital, preference share capital are affected by the financing decision, which is a part of financing management.\n(\n v) All items in the Profit and Loss Account, e.g., Interest, Expense,\n \nDepreciation, etc. : Higher amount of debt means higher interest expense in future. Similarly, use of higher equity may entail higher payment of dividends. Similarly, an expansion of business which is a result of capital budgeting decision is likely to affect virtually all items in the profit and loss account of the \nbusiness.\nIt can, thus, be stated that the \nfinancial statements of a business \nare largely determined by financial management decisions taken earlier. Similarly, the future financial statements would depend upon past as well as current financial decisions. Thus, the overall financial health of a business is determined by the quality of its financial management. Good financial management aims at mobilisation of financial resources at a lower cost and deployment of these in most lucrative activities.\noBjecTiveS\nThe primary aim of financial management is to maximise shareholders’ wealth, which is referred to as the wealth-maximisation concept.

This is because a company funds belong to the shareholders and the manner in which they are invested and the return earned by them determines their market value and price. It means maximisation of the market value of equity shares. The market price of equity share increases, if the benefit from a decision exceeds the cost involved. All financial decisions aim at ensuring that each decision is efficient and adds some value. Such value additions tend to increase the market price of shares. Therefore, those financial decisions are taken which will ultimately prove gainful from the point of view of the shareholders. The shareholders gain if the value of shares in the market increases. Those decisions which result in decline in the share price are poor financial decisions. Thus, we can say, the objective of financial management is to maximise the current price of equity shares of the company or to maximise the wealth of owners of the company, that is, the shareholders.\nTherefore, when a decision is taken \nabout investment in a new machine, the aim of financial management is to ensure that benefits from the investment exceed the cost so that some value addition takes place. Similarly, when finance is procured, the aim is to reduce the cost so that the value addition is even higher.\nIn fact, in all financial decisions, \nmajor or minor, the ultimate objective that guides the decision-maker is that some value addition should take place. All those avenues of investment, modes of financing, ways of handling various components of working capital must be identified which will ultimately lead to an increase in the price of equity share. It can happen through efficient decision-making. Decision-making is efficient if, out of the various available alternatives, the best is selected.\nFinancial  deciSionS\nFinancial management is concerned with the solution of three major issues relating to the financial operations of a firm corresponding to the three questions of investment, financing and divident decision. In a financial context, it means the selection of best financing alternative or best investment alternative. The finance function, therefore, is concerned with three broad decisions which are explained below:\ninvestment Decision\nA firm’s resources are scarce in comparison to the uses to which they \ncan be put. A firm, therefore, \nhas to choose where to invest these resources, so that they are able to earn the highest possible return for their investors. The investment decision, therefore, relates to how the firm’s funds are invested in different assets.\nInvestment decision can be long-\nterm or short-term. A long-term investment decision is also called a Capital Budgeting decision. It involves committing the finance on a long-\nCh_9.indd   218 10-08-2022   09:09:51\n2024-25"

For example, making \ninvestment in a new machine to replace an existing one or acquiring a new fixed asset or opening a new branch, etc. These decisions are very crucial for any business since they affect its earning capacity in the long run. The size of assets, profitability and competitiveness are all affected by capital budgeting decisions. Moreover, these decisions normally involve huge amounts of investment and are irreversible except at a huge cost. Therefore, once made, it is often almost impossible for a business to wriggle out of such decisions. Therefore, they need to be taken with utmost care. These decisions) are concerned with the \ndecisions about the levels of cash, inventory and receivables. These decisions affect the day-to-day working of a business. These affect the liquidity as well as profitability of a business. Efficient cash management, inventory management and receivables management are essential ingredients of sound working capital management.\nFactors affecting Capital \nBudgeting Decision\nA number of projects are often available \nto a business to invest in. But each project has to be evaluated carefully and, depending upon the returns, a particular project is either selected or rejected. If there is only one project, its viability in terms of the rate of return, viz., investment and its comparability with the industry’s average is seen. There are certain factors which affect capital budgeting decisions.(a)\n Cash flo\nws of the project: When \na company takes an investment decision involving huge amount it expects to generate some cash flows over a period. These cash flows are in the form of a series of cash receipts and payments over the life of an investment. The amount of these cash flows should be carefully analysed before considering a capital budgeting decision.\n(b)\n The rate of return: The most\n \nimportant criterion is the rate of return of the project. These calculations are based on the Wealth Maximisation Concept\ndecisions must be taken by those who \nunderstand them comprehensively. A bad capital budgeting decision normally has the capacity to severely damage the financial fortune of a business.

Suppose, there are two projects, A and B (with the same risk involved), with a rate of return of 10 per cent and 12 per cent, respectively, then under normal circumstance, project B should be selected.\n(c)\n The investment criteria involved:  \nThe decisi\non to invest in a particular \nproject involves a number of calculations regarding the amount of investment, interest rate, cash flows and rate of return. There are different techniques to evaluate investment proposals which are known as capital budgeting techniques. These techniques are applied to each proposal before selecting a particular project.\nFinancing Decision\nThis decision is about the quantum \nof finance to be raised from various  \nlong-term sources. Short-term sources are studied under the ‘working capital \nmanagement’.\nIt involves identification of various \navailable sources. The main sources \nof funds for a firm are shareholders’ funds and borrowed funds. The shareholders’ funds refer to the equity capital and the retained earnings. Borrowed funds refer to the finance raised through debentures or other forms of debt. A firm has to decide the proportion of funds to be raised from either sources, based on their basic characteristics. Interest on borrowed funds have to be paid regardless of whether or not a firm has earned a \nprofit. Likewise, the borrowed funds have to be repaid at a fixed time. The risk of default on payment is known as financial risk which has to be considered by a firm likely to have insufficient shareholders to make these fixed payments. Shareholders’ funds, on the other hand, involve no commitment regarding the payment of returns or the repayment of capital. A firm, therefore, needs to have a judicious mix of both debt and equity in making financing decisions, which may be debt, equity, preference share capital, and retained earnings.\nThe cost of each type of finance has \nto be estimated. Some sources may be cheaper than others. For example, debt is considered to be the cheapest of all the sources, tax deductibility of interest makes it still cheaper. Associated risk is also different for each source, e.g., it is necessary to pay interest on debt and redeem the principal amount on maturity. There is no such compulsion to pay any dividend on equity shares. Thus, there is some amount of financial risk in debt financing. The overall financial risk depends upon the proportion of debt in the total capital. The fund raising exercise also costs something. This cost is called floatation cost. It also must be considered while evaluating different sources. Financing decision is, thus, concerned with the decisions about how much to be raised \nfrom which source. This decision determines the overall cost of capital and the financial risk of the enterprise.\nCh_9.indd   220 10-08-2022   09:09:51\n2024-25"

Important among them are as follows:(a)\n Cos\nt: The cost of raising funds \nthrough different sources are different. A prudent financial \nmanager would normally opt for a source which is the cheapest.\n(b)\n Risk: The risk associated with each \nof the sources is different.\n(c) Floatation Costs: Higher the floatation  \ncost, less attractive the source.\nFinancial Decisions\nCh_9.indd   221 10-08-2022   09:09:52\n2024-25"

Hence, lower debt financing is better. Similarly, if fixed operating cost is less, more of debt financing may be preferred.\n(f)\n Control Considerations: issues of \nmore equity may \nlead to dilution \nof management’s control over the business. Debt financing has no such implication. Companies afraid of a takeover bid would prefer debt to equity.\n(g)\n State of Capital Market: Health of \nthe capital market \nmay also affect \nthe choice of source of fund. During the period when stock market is rising, more people invest in equity. However, depressed capital market may make issue of equity shares difficult for any company.\nDividend Decision\nThe third important decision that \nevery financial manager has to take relates to the distribution of dividend. Dividend is that portion of profit which is distributed to shareholders. The decision involved here is how much of the profit earned by company (after paying tax) is to be distributed to the shareholders and how much of it should be retained in the business. While the dividend constitutes the current income re-investment as retained earning increases the firm’s future earning capacity. The extent of retained earnings also influences the financing decision of the firm. Since the firm does not require funds to the extent of re-invested retained earnings, the decision regarding dividend should be taken keeping in view the overall objective of maximising shareholder’s wealth.\nFactors Affecting Dividend \nDecision\nHow much of the profits earned by a \ncompany will be distributed as profit and how much will be retained in the business is affected by many factors. Some of the important factors are discussed as follows:(a)\n Amount of Earnings: Dividends are paid \nout of current and past \nearning. Therefore, earnings is a major determinant of the decision about dividend. \n(b)\n Stability Earnings: Other things remai\nning the same, a company \nhaving stable earning is in a better position to declare higher dividends. As against this, a company having unstable earnings is likely to pay smaller dividend.\n(c)\n Stability of Dividends: Companies generally follow a policy \nof \nstabilising dividend per share. The increase in dividends is generally made when there is confidence that \nCh_9.indd   222 1/23/2024   03:51:22 PM\n2024-25"

In other words, dividend per share is not altered if the change in earnings is small or seen to be temporary in nature.\n(d)\n Growth Opportunities: Companies having good growth \nopportunities \nretain more money out of their earnings so as to finance the required investment. The dividend in growth companies is, therefore, smaller, than that in the non–growth companies.\n(e)\n Cash Flow Position: The payment of dividend involves \nan outflow of \ncash. A company may be earning profit but may be short on cash. Availability of enough cash in the company is necessary for declaration of dividend.\n(f)\n Shareholders’ Preference: \nWhile \ndeclaring dividends, managements must keep in mind the preferences of the shareholders in this regard. If the shareholders in general desire that at least a certain amount is paid as dividend, the companies are likely to declare the same. There are always some shareholders who depend upon a regular income from their investments.\n(g)\n Taxation Policy: The choice between\n \nthe payment of dividend and retaining the earnings is, to some extent, affected by the difference in the tax treatment of dividends and capital gains. If tax on dividend is higher, it is better to pay less by way of dividends. As compared \nto this, higher dividends may be declared if tax rates are relatively lower. Though the dividends are free of tax in the hands of shareholders, a dividend distribution tax is levied on companies. Thus, under the present tax policy, shareholders are likely to prefer higher dividends.\n(h)\n Stock Market Reaction: Investors, in general, view \nan increase in \ndividend as a good news and stock prices react positively to it. Similarly, a decrease in dividend may have a negative impact on the share prices in the stock market. Thus, the possible impact of dividend policy on the equity share price is one of the important factors considered by the management while taking a decision about it.\n(i)\n Access to Capital Market: Large and reputed companies \ngenerally have \neasy access to the capital market and, therefore, may depend less on retained earning to finance their growth. These companies tend to pay higher dividends than the smaller companies which have relatively low access to the market.\n(j)\n Legal Constraints: Certain provisions of \nthe Companies Act \nplace restrictions on payouts as dividend. Such provisions must be adhered to while declaring the dividend.\n(k)\n Contractual Constraints: While granting loans to \na company, \nsometimes the lender may impose \nCh_9.indd   223 1/23/2024   03:51:22 PM\n2024-25"

The companies are required to ensure that the dividend does not violate the terms of the loan agreement in this regard.\nFinancial  Planning\nFinancial planning is essentially the  preparation of a financial blueprint of an organisation’s future operations. The objective of financial planning is to ensure that enough funds are available at right time. If adequate funds are not available the firm will not be able to honour its commitments and carry out its plans. On the other hand, if excess funds are available, it will unnecessarily add to the cost and may encourage wasteful expenditure. It must be kept in mind that financial planning is not equivalent to, or a substitute for, financial management. Financial management aims at choosing the best investment and financing alternatives by focusing on their costs and benefits. Its objective is to increase the shareholders’ wealth.Financial planning on the other hand aims at smooth operations by focusing on fund requirements and their availability in the light of financial decisions. For example, if a capital budgeting decisions is taken, the operations are likely to be at a higher scale. The amount of expenses and revenues are likely to increase. Financial planning process tries to forecast all the items which are likely \nto undergo changes. It enables the management to foresee the fund requirements both the quantum as well as the timing. Likely shortage and surpluses are forecast so that necessary activities are taken in advance to meet those situations. Thus, financial planning strives to achieve the following twin objectives.(a)\n To ensure availability of funds whenever requir\ned: This include \na proper estimation of the funds required for different purposes such as for the purchase of long-term assets or to meet day-to-day expenses of business etc. Apart from this, there is a need to estimate the time at which these funds are to be made available. Financial planning also tries to specify possible sources of these funds. \n(b)\n To see tha\nt the firm does not \nraise resources unnecessarily:  \nExcess funding is almost as bad as inadequate funding. Even if there is some surplus money, good financial planning would put it to the best possible use so that the financial resources are not left idle and don’t unnecessarily add to  \nthe cost.\nThus, a proper matching of funds \nrequirements and their availability \nis sought to be achieved by financial planning. This process of estimating the fund requirement of a business and specifying the sources of funds \nCh_9.indd   224 1/23/2024   03:51:22 PM\n2024-25"

Financial \nplanning takes into consideration the growth, performance, investments and requirement of funds for a given period. Financial planning includes both short-term as well as long-term planning. Long-term planning relates to long term growth and investment. It focuses on capital expenditure programmes. Short-term planning covers short-term financial plan called budget.\nTypically, financial planning is \ndone for three to five years. For longer periods it becomes more difficult and less useful. Plans made for periods of one year or less are termed as budgets. Budgets are example of financial planning exercise in greater details. They include detailed plan of action for a period of one year or less. \nFinancial planning usually begins \nwith the preparation of a sales  forecast. Let us suppose a company is making a financial plan for the next five years. It will start with an estimate of the sales which are likely to happen in the next five years. Based on these, the financial statements are prepared keeping in mind the requirement of funds for investment in the fixed capital and working capital. Then the expected profits during the period are estimated so that an idea can be made of how much of the fund requirements can be met internally i.e., through retained earnings (after dividend payouts). This results in an estimation of the requirement for external funds. Further, the sources from which the \nexternal funds requirement can be met are identified and cash budgets are made, incorporating these factors.\nimPortance\nFinancial planning is an important part of overall planning of any business enterprise. It aims at enabling the company to tackle the uncertainty in respect of the availability and timing of the funds and helps in smooth functioning of an organisation. The importance of financial planning can be explained as follows:\n (i) It helps in forecasting what \nmay \nhappen in future under different business situations. By doing so, it helps the firms to face the eventual situation in a better way. In other words, it makes the firm better prepared to face the future. For example, a growth of 20% in sales is predicted. However, it may happen that the growth rate eventually turns out to be 10% or 30%. Many items of expenses shall be different in these three situations. By preparing a blueprint of these three situations the management may decide what must be done in each of these situations. This preparation of alternative financial plans to meet different situations is clearly of immense help in running the business smoothly.\n (ii) It helps \nin avoiding business \nshocks and surprises and helps \nCh_9.indd   225 1/23/2024   03:51:22 PM\n2024-25"

(vi) It provides a link between invest\nment and financing decisions \non a continuous basis.\n (vii) By spelli\nng out detailed objectives \nfor various business segments, it makes the evaluation of actual performance easier.\ncaPital  Structure\nOne of the important decisions under financial management relates to the financing pattern or the proportion of Cutting Back on Debt\nEven successful businesses have debt, but how much is too much? Learning how \nto manage debt is what can put you ahead.\nTaking on the right amount of debt can mean the difference between a business \nstruggling to survive and one that can respond nimbly to changing economic or market conditions. A number of circumstances may justify acquiring debt. As a general rule, borrowing makes the most sense when you need to bolster cash flow or finance growth or expansion. But while debt can provide the leverage you need to grow, too much debt can strangle your business. So the question is: How much debt is too much?\nThe answer, experts say, lies in a careful analysis of your cash flow as well as \nyour industry. A business that doesn’t grow dies. You’ve got to grow, but you’ve got to grow within the financial constraints of your business. What is the ideal capital structure a business needs in its industry to remain viable? The higher the volatility (in your industry), the less debt you should have. The smaller the volatility, the more debt you can afford.\nAlthough banks and other financial institutions look for a satisfactory debt-to-\nequity ratio before agreeing to make a loan, don’t assume a creditor’s willingness to extend funds is evidence that your business is in a strong debt position. Some financial institutions are overzealous lenders, particularly when trying to lure or hold on to promising business customers. “The bank may be looking more at collateral than whether the (business’s) earnings are going to come in to justify the debt service.\nTo avoid these and other credit pitfalls, it’s up to you to get the financial facts \non your business and make sound borrowing decisions. Unfortunately, many entrepreneurs fail to recognise how important financial analysis is to running a successful business. Even business owners who receive detailed financial statements from their accountants often do not take advantage of the valuable information contained in the documents.\nCh_9.indd   226 1/23/2024   03:51:22 PM\n2024-25"

On the basis of ownership, the sources of business finance can be broadly classified into two categories viz., ‘owners’ funds’ and ‘borrowed funds’. Owners’ funds consist of equity share capital, preference share capital and reserves and surpluses or retained earnings. Borrowed funds can be in the form of loans, debentures, public deposits etc. These may be borrowed from banks, other financial institutions, debentureholders and public.\n Capital structure refers to the \nmix \nbetween owners and borrowed funds. These shall be referred as equity and debt in the subsequent text. It can be calculated as debt-equity ratio  \ni.e.,\nDebt\nEquity\n\n or as the proportion \nof debt out of the total capital i.e., \nDebt\nDebt +Equity\n\n. \nDebt and equity differ significantly \nin their cost and riskiness for the \nfirm. The cost of debt is lower than the cost of equity for a firm because the lender’s risk is lower than the equity shareholder’s risk, since the lender earns an assured return and repayment of capital and, therefore, they should require a lower rate of return. Additionally, interest paid on debt is a deductible expense for computation of tax liability whereas dividends are paid out of after-tax profit. Increased use of debt, therefore, is likely to lower the over-all cost of \ncapital of the firm provided that the cost of equity remains unaffected. Impact of a change in the debt-equity ratio upon the earning per share is dealt with in detail later in this chapter.\nDebt is cheaper but is more risky \nfor a business because the payment of interest and the return of principal is obligatory for the business. Any default in meeting these commitments may force the business to go into liquidation. There is no such compulsion in case of equity, which is therefore, considered riskless for the business. Higher use of debt increases the fixed financial charges of a business. As a result, increased use of debt increases the financial risk of a company.\nFinancial risk is the chance that \na firm would fail to meet its payment obligations.\nCapital structure of a company, \nthus, affects both the profitability and the financial risk. A capital structure will be said to be optimal when the proportion of debt and equity is such that it results in an increase in the value of the equity share. In other words, all decisions relating to capital structure should emphasise on increasing the shareholders’ wealth. \nThe proportion of debt in the overall \ncapital is also called financial leverage. \nFinancial leverage is computed as\nD\nE \norD\nD+E when D is the Debt and E is \nthe Equity.

The impact of financial leverage on the profitability of a business can be seen through EBIT-EPS (Earning before Interest and Taxes-Earning per Share) analysis as in the following example.\n Three situations are considered.\n \nThere is no debt in situation-I i.e. (unlevered business). Debt of Rs. 10 lakh and 20 lakh are assumed in situations-II and III, respectively. All debt is at 10% p.a.\n The company earns Rs. 0.93 \nper \nshare if it is unlevered. With debt of Rs. 10 lakh its EPS is Rs. 1.05. With a still higher debt of Rs. 20 lakh, its, EPS rises to Rs. 1.40. Why is the EPS rising with higher debt? It is because the cost of debt is lower than the return that company is earning on funds employed. The company is earning a Return on Investment (RoI).Example I\nCompany X Ltd.\n Total Funds used  Rs. 30 Lakh\n Interest rate  10% p.a.\n Tax rate  30%\n EBIT  Rs. 4 Lakh\n Debt\n s ituation i nil\n Situation II  Rs. 10 Lakh\n Situation III  Rs. 20 Lakh\nEBIT-EPS Analysis\n  Situation I  Situation II  Situation III \n EBIT   4,00,000   4,00,000  4,00,000\n Interest  NIL 1,00,000  2,00,000\n EBT  4,00,000  3,00,000  2,00,000\n (Earnings before taxes)\n Tax 1,20,000  90,000  60,000\n EAT 2,80,000  2,10,000  1,40,000\n (Earnings after taxes)\n No. of shares of Rs.10  3,00,000  2,00,000  1,00,000\n EPS 0.93 1.05 1.40\n (Earnings per share)\nCh_9.indd   228 2/6/2024   11:23:29 AM\n2024-25"

This is higher than \nthe 10% interest it is paying on debt \nfunds. With higher use of debt, this difference between RoI and cost of debt increases the EPS. This is a situation of favourable financial leverage. In such cases, companies often employ more of cheaper debt to enhance the \nEPS. Such practice is called Trading on Equity.\n Trading on Equity refers to the \nincrease in profit earned by the equity \nshareholders due to the presence of fixed financial charges like interest. \n Now consider the following case \nof \nCompany Y.

It is because the Company’s rate of return on investment (RoI) is less than the cost of debt. The RoI \nfor company Y is \n2Lakh\n30Lakh100× , i.e., \n6.67%, whereas the interest rate on \ndebt is 10%. In such cases, the use of debt reduces the EPS. This is a situation of unfavourable financial leverage. Trading on Equity is clearly unadvisable in such a situation.\nEven in case of Company X, \nreckless use of Trading on Equity is not recommended. An increase in debt \nmay enhance the EPS but as pointed out earlier, it also raises the financial risk. Ideally, a company must choose that risk-return combination which maximises shareholders’ wealth. The debt-equity mix that achieves it, is the optimum capital structure.\nFactors affecting the Choice of \nCapital Structure\nDeciding about the capital structure \nof a firm involves determining the relative proportion of various types of funds.

Interest payment and repayment of principal are obligatory on a business. In addition a company planning to raise debt must have sufficient cash to meet the increased outflows because of higher debt. Similarly, important factors which determine the choice of capital structure are as follows:1. Cash Flow Position: Size of projected \ncash flows must be considered before borrowing. Cash flows must not only cover fixed cash payment obligations but there must be sufficient buffer also. It must be kept in mind that a company has cash payment obligations for (i) normal business operations; (ii) for investment in fixed assets; and (iii) for meeting the debt service commitments i.e., payment of interest and repayment  \nof principal.\n2. Interest Coverage Ratio (ICR): \nThe interest coverage ratio refers to the number of times earnings before interest and taxes of a company covers the interest obligation. This may be calculated as follows:  \n ICR = EBIT\nInterest\nThe higher the ratio, lower shall \nbe the risk of company failing to meet its interest payment obligations. However, this ratio is not an adequate measure. A firm may have a high EBIT but low cash balance. Apart from interest, repayment obligations are also relevant.3. Debt Service Coverage Ratio \n(DSCR): Debt Service Coverage Ratio \ntakes care of the deficiencies referred to in the Interest Coverage Ratio (ICR). The cash profits generated by the operations are compared with the total cash required for the service of the debt and the preference share capital. It is calculated as follows:\nProfit after tax + Depreciation + Interest + Non Cash exp.\nPref. Div + Interest + Repayment obligation\na higher DSCR indicates better \nability to \nmeet cash commitments \nand consequently, the company’s potential to increase debt component in its capital structure.\n4. Return on Investment (RoI): \nif \nthe RoI of the company \nis higher, it \ncan choose to use trading on equity \nto increase its EPS, i.e., its ability to use debt is greater. We have already observed in Example I that a firm can use more debt to increase its EPS. However, in Example II, use of higher debt is reducing the EPS. It is because the firm is earning an RoI of only 6.67% which lower than its cost of debt. In example I the RoI is 13.33%, and trading on equity is profitable. It shows that, RoI is an important determinant of the company’s ability to use Trading on equity and thus the capital structure.\n5. Cost of debt: A firm’s ability to \nborrow at a lower rate increases its capacity to employ higher debt. Thus, more debt can be used if debt can be raised at a lower rate.\nCh_9.indd   230 1/23/2024   03:51:23 PM\n2024-25"

The firms in our examples are borrowing @ 10%. Since the tax rate is 30%, the after tax cost of debt is only 7%. A higher tax rate, thus, makes debt relatively cheaper and increases its attraction vis-à-vis equity.\n7. Cost of Equity: Stock owners \nexpect a rate of return from the equity \nwhich is commensurate with the risk they are assuming. When a company increases debt, the financial risk faced by the equity holders, increases. Consequently, their desired rate of return may increase. It is for this reason that a company can not use debt beyond a point. If debt is used beyond that point, cost of equity may go up sharply and share price may decrease inspite of increased EPS. Consequently, for maximisation of shareholders’ wealth, debt can be used only upto a level.\n8. Floatation Costs: Process of \nraising resources also involves some cost. Public issue of shares and debentures requires considerable expenditure. Getting a loan from a financial institution may not cost so much. These considerations may also affect the choice between debt and equity and hence the  \ncapital structure.\n9. Risk Consideration: As discussed \nearlier, use of debt increases the financial risk of a business. Financial risk refers to a position when a company is unable to meet its fixed \nfinancial charges namely interest payment, preference dividend and repayment obligations. Apart from the financial risk, every business has some operating risk (also called business risk). Business risk depends upon fixed operating costs. Higher fixed operating costs result in higher business risk and vice-versa. The total risk depends upon both the business risk and the financial risk. If a firm’s business risk is lower, its capacity to use debt is higher and vice-versa.\n10. Flexibility: If a firm uses its \ndebt potential to the full, it loses flexibility to issue further debt. To maintain flexibility, it must maintain some borrowing power to take care of unforeseen circumstances.\n11. Control: Debt normally does \nnot cause a dilution of control. A public issue of equity may reduce the managements’ holding in the company and make it vulnerable to takeover. This factor also influences the choice between debt and equity especially in companies in which the current holding of management is on a lower side.\n12. Regulatory Framework:  Every \ncompany operates within a regulatory \nframework provided by the law e.g., public issue of shares and debentures have to be made under SEBI guidelines. Raising funds from banks and other financial institutions require fulfillment of other norms. The relative ease with which these norms can, be \nCh_9.indd   231 1/23/2024   03:51:23 PM\n2024-25"

Stock Market Conditions: \nif the \nstock markets are \nbullish, equity \nshares are more easily sold even at \na higher price. Use of equity is often preferred by companies in such a situation. However, during a bearish phase, a company, may find raising of equity capital more difficult and it may opt for debt. Thus, stock market conditions often affect the choice between the two.\n14. Capital Structure of other \nCompanies: A useful guideline in the capital structure planning is the debt-equity ratios of other companies in the same industry. There are usually some industry norms which may help. Care however must be taken that the company does not follow the industry norms blindly. For example, if the business risk of a firm is higher, it can not afford the same financial risk. It should go in for low debt. Thus, the management must know what the industry norms are, whether they are following them or deviating from them and adequate justification must be there in both cases.\nFixed and Working  caPital\nMeaning\nEvery company needs funds to finance \nits assets and activities. Investment is required to be made in fixed assets and current assets. Fixed assets are those which remains in the business for more than one year, usually \nfor much longer, e.g., plant and machinery, furniture and fixture, land and building, vehicles, etc.\nDecision to invest in fixed assets \nmust be taken very carefully as the investment is usually quite large. Such decisions once taken are irrevocable except at a huge loss. Such decisions are called capital budgeting decisions.\ncurrent assets are those assets\n \nwhich, in the normal routine of the business, get converted into cash or cash equivalents within one year, e.g., inventories, debtors, bills receivables, etc.\nManagement of Fixed Capital\nFixed capital refers to investment \nin long-term assets. Management of fixed capital involves allocation of firm’s capital to different projects or assets with long-term implications for the business. These decisions are called investment decisions or capital budgeting decisions and affect the growth, profitability and risk of the business in the long run. These long-term assets last for more than  \none year.\n It must be f\ninanced through  \nlong-term sources of capital such as equity or preference shares, debentures, long-term loans and retained earnings of the business. Fixed Assets should never be financed through short-term sources.\n Investment in these assets \nwould \nalso include expenditure on \nCh_9.indd   232 1/23/2024   03:51:23 PM\n2024-25"

These decisions include purchase of land, building, plant and machinery, launching a new product line or investing in advanced techniques of production. Major expenditures such as those on advertising campaign or research and development programme having long term implications for the firm are also examples of capital budgeting decisions. The management of fixed capital or investment or capital budgeting decisions are important for the following reasons:\n(i)\n Long-term growth: These \ndecisions \nhave bearing on the long-term \ngrowth. The funds invested in long-term assets are likely to yield returns in the future. These will affect the future prospects of the business.\n(ii)\n Large amount of funds involved:  \nThese de\ncisions result in a \nsubstantial portion of capital funds being blocked in long-term projects. Therefore, these investments are planned after a detailed analysis is undertaken. This may involve decisions like where to procure funds from and at what rate of interest.\n(iii) Risk involved: Fixed capital involves investment \nof huge amounts. It \naffects the returns of the firm as a whole in the long-term. Therefore, investment decisions involving fixed capital influence the overall business risk complexion of the firm.(iv) Irreversible decisions:  these \ndecisions \nonce taken, are not \nreversible without incurring heavy \nlosses. Abandoning a project after heavy investment is made is quite costly in terms of waste of funds. Therefore, these decisions should be taken only after carefully evaluating each detail or else the adverse financial consequences may be very heavy.\nFactors affecting the Requirement \nof Fixed Capital\n1.\n Nature of Business: \nThe type \nof business has a bearing upon \nthe fixed capital requirements. For example, a trading concern needs lower investment in fixed assets compared with a manufacturing organisation; since it does not require to purchase plant and machinery, etc.\n2.\n Scale of Operations: A lar\nger \norganisation operating at a higher \nscale needs bigger plant, more space etc. and therefore, requires higher investment in fixed assets when compared with the small organisation.\n3.\n Choice of \nTechnique: Some \norganisations are capital intensive \nwhereas others are labour intensive. A capital-intensive organisation requires higher investment in plant and machinery as it relies less on manual labour. The requirement of fixed capital for such organisations would be higher. Labour intensive organisations on the other hand \nCh_9.indd   233 1/23/2024   03:51:23 PM\n2024-25"

                "text": "Financial ManageMents\n235\nBUsiness  st UDies\n234\nrequire less investment in fixed assets. \nHence, their fixed capital requirement is lower.\n4. Technology Upgradation: In certain \nindustries, assets become obsolete sooner. Consequently, their replace-ments become due faster. Higher investment in fixed assets may, therefore, be required in such cases. For example, computers become obsolete faster and are replaced much sooner than say, furniture. Thus, such organisations which use assets which are prone to obsolescence require higher fixed capital to purchase such assets.\n5. Growth Prospects: Higher growth \nof an organisation generally requires higher investment in fixed assets. Even when such growth is expected, a company may choose to create higher capacity in order to meet the anticipated higher demand quicker. This entails larger investment in fixed assets and consequently larger fixed capital.\n6. Diversification:  A firm may choose \nto diversify its operations for various \nreasons, With diversification, fixed capital requirements increase e.g., a textile company is diversifying and starting a cement manufacturing plant. Obviously, its investment in fixed capital will increase.\n7. Financing Alternatives: A developed \nfinancial market may provide leasing facilities as an alternative to outright purchase. When an asset is taken on lease, the firm pays lease rentals and \nuses it. By doing so, it avoids huge sums required to purchase it. Availability of leasing facilities, thus, may reduce the funds required to be invested in fixed assets, thereby reducing the fixed capital requirements. Such a strategy is specially suitable in high risk lines of business.\n8. Level of Collaboration: At times, \ncertain business organisations share each other’s facilities. For example, a bank may use another’s ATM or some of them may jointly establish a particular facility. This is feasible if the scale of operations of each one of them is not sufficient to make full use of the facility. Such collaboration reduces the level of investment in fixed assets  \nfor each one of the participating organisations.\nWorking  caPital\nApart from the investment in fixed assets every business organisation needs to invest in current assets. This investment facilitates smooth day-to-day operations of the business. Current assets are usually more liquid but contribute less to the profits than fixed assets. Examples of current assets, in order of their liquidity, are as under.\n1.\n Cash in hand/Cash at Bank\n2. Marketable securities\n3. Bills receivable\n4. Debtors\n5. Finished goods inventory\nCh_9.indd   234 1/23/2024   03:51:23 PM\n2024-25"

Prepaid expenses\nThese assets, as noted earlier, \nare \nexpected to get converted into cash \nor cash equivalents within a period of one year. These provide liquidity to the business. An asset is more liquid if it can be converted into cash quicker and without reduction in value. Insufficient investment in current assets may make it more difficult for an organisation to meet its payment obligations. However, these assets provide little or low return. Hence, a balance needs to be struck between liquidity and profitability.\nCurrent liabilities are those \npayment obligations which are due for payment within one year; such as bills payable, creditors, outstanding expenses and advances received from customers, etc.\nSome part of current assets is \nusually financed through short-term sources, i.e., current liabilities. The rest is financed through long-term sources and is called net working capital. Thus, NWC = CA – CL (i.e. Current Assets - Current Liabilities.) Thus, net working capital may be defined as the excess of current assets over current liabilities.\nFactorS  aFFecting  the Working  \ncaPital  requirementS\n1. Nature of Business: The basic nature of a business influences the amount of working capital required. \nA trading organisation usually needs a smaller amount of working capital compared to a manufacturing organisation. This is because there is usually no processing. Therefore, there is no distinction between raw materials and finished goods. Sales can be effected immediately upon the receipt of materials, sometimes even before that. In a manufacturing business, however, raw material needs to be converted into finished goods before any sales become possible. Other factors remaining the same, a trading business requires less working capital. Similarly, service industries which usually do not have to maintain inventory require less working capital.\n2. Scale of Operations: For \norganisations which operate on a higher scale of operation, the quantum of inventory and debtors required is generally high. Such organisations, therefore, require large amount of working capital as compared to the organisations which operate on a lower scale.\n3. Business Cycle: Different phases of \nbusiness cycles affect the requirement of working capital by a firm. In case of a boom, the sales as well as production are likely to be larger and, therefore, larger amount of working capital is required. As against this, the requirement for working capital will be lower during  the period of depression as the sales as well as production\n will be small.\nCh_9.indd   235 1/23/2024   03:51:23 PM\n2024-25"

For example, \na firm managing its raw materials efficiently may be able to manage with a smaller balance. This is reflected in a higher inventory turnover ratio. Similarly, a better debtors turnover ratio may be achieved reducing the amount tied up in receivables. Better sales effort may reduce the average time for which finished goods inventory is held. Such efficiencies may reduce the level of raw materials, finished goods and debtors resulting in lower requirement of working capital.\n9. Availability of Raw Material:  \nif \nthe raw materials and other \nrequired \nmaterials are available freely and \ncontinuously, lower stock levels may suffice. If, however, raw materials do not have a record of un-interrupted availability, higher stock levels may be required. In addition, the time lag between the placement of order and the actual receipt of the materials (also called lead time) is also relevant. Larger the lead time, larger the quantity of material to be stored and larger shall be the amount of working capital required.\n10. Growth Prospects: If the growth \npotential of a concern is perceived to be higher, it will require larger amount of working capital so that it is able to meet higher production and sales target whenever required.\n11. Level of Competition: Higher level \nof competitiveness may necessitate \nlarger stocks of finished goods to 4. Seasonal Factors: Most business \nhave some seasonality in their operations. In peak season, because of higher level of activity, larger amount of working capital is required. As against this, the level of activity as well as the requirement for working capital will be lower during the  \nlean season.\n5. Production Cycle: Production \ncycle is the time span between the receipt of raw material and their conversion into finished goods. Some businesses have a longer production cycle while some have a shorter one. Duration and the length of production cycle, affects the amount of funds required for raw materials and expenses. Consequently, working capital requirement is higher in firms with longer processing cycle and lower in firms with shorter processing cycle.\n6. Credit Allowed: Different firms \nallow different credit terms to their customers. These depend upon the level of competition that a firm faces as well as the credit worthiness of their clientele. A liberal credit policy results in higher amount of debtors, increasing the requirement of working capital.\n7. Credit Availed: Just as a firm \nallows credit to its customers it also may get credit from its suppliers. To the extent it avails the credit on purchases, the working capital requirement is reduced.\n8. Operating Efficiency: Firms \nmanage their operations with varied \nCh_9.indd   236 1/23/2024   03:51:23 PM\n2024-25"

Competition may also force the firm to extend liberal credit terms discussed earlier.\n12. Inflation: With rising prices, \nlarger amounts are required even \nto maintain a constant volume of production and sales. The working capital requirement of a business thus, become higher with higher rate of inflation. It must, however, be noted that an inflation rate of 5%, does not mean that every component of working capital will change by the same percentage.

Almost all business activities require some finance. \nFinance is needed to establish a business, to run it, to modernise it, to expand, and diversify it. \nFinancial Management: Financial Management is concerned with optimal \nprocurement as well as usage of finance. For optimal procurement, different \navailable sources of finance are identified and compared in terms of their costs and associated risks.\nObjectives and Financial Decisions The primary aim of financial management \nis to maximise shareholders’ wealth which is referred to as the wealth \nmaximisation concept. The market price of a company’s shares are linked to the three basic financial decisions\nFinancial decision-making is concerned with three broad decisions which are \nInvestment Decision, Financing Decision, Dividend Decision\nFinancial Planning and Importance  Financial planning is essentially \npreparation of a financial blueprint of an organisation’s future operations.

It aims at enabling the company to tackle the uncertainty in respect of the availability and timing of the funds and helps in smooth functioning of an organisation. \nCapital Structure and Factors One of the important decisions under financial \nmanagement relates to the financing pattern or the proportion of the use of different sources in raising funds. On the basis of ownership, the sources of business finance can be broadly classified into two categories viz., ‘owners funds’ and ‘borrowed funds’. Capital structure refers to the mix between owners and borrowed funds.\n Deciding about the capital structure \nof a firm involves determining the \nrelative proportion of various types of funds. This depends on various factors which are: Cash Flow Position, Interest Coverage Ratio (ICR), Debt Service Coverage Ratio (DSCR), Return on Investment (RoI), Cost of debt, Tax Rate, Cost of Equity, Floatation Costs, Risk Consideration, Flexibility, Control, Regulatory Framework, Stock Market Conditions, and Capital Structure of other Companies.\nFixed and Working Capital Fixed capital refers to investment in long-term \nassets. Management of fixed capital involves around allocation of firm’s capital to different projects or assets with long-term implications for the business. These decisions are called investment decisions or capital budgeting decisions.

                "text": "MArkeTING\n243\nThe term marketing has been described \nby different people in different ways. Some people believe that marketing is same as ‘shopping’. Whenever they go out for shopping of certain products or services, they describe it as marketing. There are some other people who confuse marketing with ‘selling’ and feel that marketing activity starts after a product or service has been produced. Some people describe it to mean ‘merchandising’ or designing a product. All these descriptions may be partly correct but marketing is a much broader concept, which is discussed as follows:\nTraditionally, marketing has been \ndescribed in terms of its functions or activities. In this respect, marketing has been referred to as performance of business activities that direct the flow of goods and services from producers to consumers.\nAs we know, most of the \nmanufacturing firms do not produce goods for their own consumption but for the consumption or use by others. Therefore, to move the goods and services from the producer to consumers, a number of activities, such as product designing or merchandising, packaging, warehousing, transportation, branding, selling, advertising and pricing are required. All these activities \nare referred to as marketing activities.\nThus, ‘merchandising’, ‘selling’ and \ndistribution are all parts of a large number of activities undertaken by a firm, which are collectively called marketing.\nIt may be noted here that marketing \nis not merely a post- production activity. It includes many activities that are performed even before goods are actually produced, and continue even after the goods have been sold. For example, activities such as identification of customer needs, collection of information for developing the product, designing suitable product package and giving it a brand name are performed before commencement of the actual production. Similarly, many follow up activities are required for maintaining good customer relations for procuring repeat sale.\nIn modern times, emphasis is placed \non describing marketing as a social process. It is a process whereby people exchange goods and services for money or for something of value to them. Taking the social perspective, Phillip \nkolter has \ndefined \nmarketing as, “a social process \nby which individual groups obtain what they need and want through creating offerings and freely exchanging products and services of value with others”.\n“Business is not financial science, it’s about trading, buying and selling. It’s about \ncreating a product or service so good that people will pay for it. ”\n— anta roddick \n“Marketing takes a day to learn. Unfortunately it takes time to master. ”\n     \n    — Philip Kotler\nCh_10.indd   243 10-08-2022   10:04:27\n2024-25"

                "text": "BUSIN eSS  STUDI eS\n244\nUnderstanding Market\nIn the traditional sense, the term ‘market’ refers to the place where buyers and sellers \ngather to enter into transactions involving the exchange of goods and services. It is in this sense that this term is being used in day to day language, even today. The other ways in which this term is being used is in the context of a product market (cotton market, gold or share market), geographic market (national and international market), type of buyers (consumer market and industrial market) and the quantity of goods transacted (retail market and wholesale market).\nBut in modern marketing sense, the term market has a broader meaning. It refers \nto a set of actual and potential buyers of a product or service. For example, when a fashion designer designs a new dress and offers it for exchange, all the people who are willing to buy and offer some value for it can be stated to be the market for that dress. Similarly, market for fans or bicycles or electric bulbs or shampoos refers to all the actual and potential buyers for these products.\nThus, marketing is a social process \nwhere in people interact with others, \nin order to persuade them to act in a particular way, say to purchase a product or a service, rather than forcing them to do so. A careful analysis of the definition shows the following important features of marketing:\n1. \nneeds and \nWants: The process \nof marketing helps individuals and \ngroups in obtaining what they need and want. Thus, the primary reason or motivation for people to engage in the process of marketing is to satisfy some of their needs or wants. In other words, the focus of the marketing process is on satisfaction of the needs and wants of individuals and organisations.\nA need is a state of felt deprivation \nor feeling of being deprived of something. If unsatisfied, it leaves a person unhappy and uncomfortable. For example, on getting hungry, we become uncomfortable and start looking for objects that are capable of satisfying our hunger.Needs are basic to human beings \nand do not pertain to a particular \nproduct. Wants, on the other hand, are culturally defined objects that are potential satisfiers of needs. In other words, human needs shaped by such factors as culture, personality and religion are called wants. A basic need for food, for example, may take various forms such as want for dosa and rice for a South Indian and chapatti and vegetables for a North Indian person.\nA marketer’s job in an organisation \nis to identify needs of the target customers and develop products and services that satisfy such needs.\n2. \ncreat\ning a Market Offering:  On \nthe part of the marketers, the effort \ninvolves creation of a ‘market offering. Market offering refers to a complete offer for a product or service, having given features like size, quality, taste, etc; at a certain price; available at a given outlet or location and so on. Let us say the offer is for a cell phone, available in four different versions, \nCh_10.indd   244 10-08-2022   10:04:27\n2024-25"

A good ‘market offer’ is the one which is developed after analysing the needs and preferences of the potential buyers.\n3. \ncustomer value:  The process \nof\n marketing facilitates exchange of \nproducts and services between the \nbuyers and the sellers. The buyers, however, make buying decisions on their perceptions of the value of the product or service in satisfying their need, in relation to its cost. A product will be purchased only if it is perceived to be giving greatest benefit or value for the money. The job of a marketer, therefore, is to add to the value of the product so that the customers prefer it in relation to the competing products and decide to purchase it.\n4. \nexchange Mechanism: The process \nof\n marketing works through the \nexchange mechanism. The individuals \n(buyers and sellers) obtain what they need and want through the process of exchange. In other words, the process of marketing involves exchange of products and services for money or something considered valuable by  \nthe people.\nexchange refers to the process \nthrough which two or more parties come together to obtain the desired\n \nproduct or service from someone, offering the same by giving something \nin return. For example, a person feeling hungry may get food by offering to give money or some other product or service in return to someone who is willing to accept the same for food.\nIn the modern world, goods are \nproduced at different places and are distributed over a wide geographical area through various middlemen, involving exchanges at different levels of distribution. \nexchange i\ns, therefore, \nreferred to as the essence of marketing. For any exchange to take place, it is important that the following conditions are satisfied:\n(i)\n Involvement of \nat least two parties \nviz., the buyer and the seller.\n(ii) each party should be capable \nof offering something of value to the other. For example, the seller offers a product and the buyer, money.\n(iii)\n each party should have the ability  \n \nto communicate and deliver the product or service. No exchange can take place if the buyers and sellers are not able to communicate with each other or if they can not deliver something of value to  \nthe other.\n(iv)\n each party sh\nould have freedom to \naccept or reject other party’s offer.\n(v) The parties should be willing to enter into transaction with \neach \nother. Thus, the acceptance or rejection of the offer takes place on voluntary basis rather than on the bases of any compulsion.\nCh_10.indd   245 10-08-2022   10:04:27\n2024-25"

Whether the exchange actually takes place or not depends on the suitability of the act of exchange to both the parties, whether it makes the parties better off or at least not worse off.\nAnother important point to be \nnoted is that Marketing is not merely a business phenomena or confined only to business organisations. Marketing activities are equally relevant to non- profit organisations such as hospitals, schools, sports clubs and social and religious organisations. It helps these organisations in achieving their goals such as spreading the message of family planning, improving the literacy standards of people and providing \nmedication to the sick.\nmarkeTing  managemenT\nMarketing management means management of the marketing function. In other words, marketing management refers to planning, organising, directing and control of the activities which facilitate exchange of goods and services between producers and consumers or users of products and services. Thus the focus of marketing management is on achieving desired exchange outcomes with the target markets. Taking a management perspective, the term marketing has been defined as “the process of planning and executing \nWhat can be Marketed?\nPhysical Products  : DVD player, Motor cycle, ipods, Cell phone, Footwear, Television, \nrefrigerator.\nservices  : Insurance, Health\n Care, Business Process Outsourcing, \nSecurity, easy Bill service, Financial Services \n(Investment),Computer education, Online Trading.\nideas : Polio Vaccin\nation, Helpage, Family Planning, Donation of \nBlood ( red cross), Donation of money on Flag Day (National \nFoundation for Communal Harmony).\nPersons  : For election of Candidates for Certain Posts.\nPlace  : ‘Visit Agra – ‘City of Love’, ‘Udaipur – \n‘The City of Lakes’, \n‘Mysore – The City of Gardens’, ‘When Orisa celebrates, \neleven the God Join  In’. \nevents  : Sports events (say Olympics, Cricket series), \ndiwali mela, \nfashion show, music concert, film festival, elephant race (\nkerala Tourism).\ninformation  : Production packagi\nng and distribution of information by \norganisations such as by universities, research organisation, providing information as market information (marketing research agencies), technology information.\nCh_10.indd   246 10-08-2022   10:04:27\n2024-25"

That means, the primary job of a marketing manager is to create superior values so that the customers are attracted to the products and services and communicate these values to the prospective buyers and persuade \nthem to buy these products.\nMarketing management involves \nperformance of various functions such as analysing and planning the marketing activities, implementing marketing plans and setting control mechanism. These functions are to be performed in such a way that organisation’s objectives are achieved at the minimum cost.\nMarketing management generally \nis related to creation of demand. However, in certain situations, the manager has to restrict the demand. For example, if there is a situation of ‘overfull demand’, i.e., the demand being more than what the company can or want to handle, (like what the situation in our country was before the adoption of policies of liberalisation and globalisation, in early 90’s, in most consumer products be it automobiles or electronics goods or other durable products. The job of marketing mangers, in these situations would be to find ways to reduce the demand temporarily by say reducing the expenditure on promotion or increasing the prices. Similarly, if the demand is ‘irregular’, such as in case of seasonal products, (say fans, woollen clothes) the marketer’s job is to change the time pattern of demand through such methods as providing short-term incentives, to the buyers. Thus, the marketing management in not only concerned with creating demand but with managing the demand effectively, as per the situation in the market.\nCh_10.indd   247 10-08-2022   10:04:27\n2024-25"

An understanding of the philosophy or the concept to be adopted is important as it determines the emphasis or the weightage to be put on different factors, in achieving the organisational objectives. For example, whether the marketing efforts of an organisation will focus on the product—say designing its features etc or on selling techniques or on customer’s needs or the social concerns.\nThe concept or philosophy of \nmarketing has evolved over a period of time, and is discussed as follows.\nthe Production concept\nDuring the earlier days of industrial revolution, the demand for \nindustrial goods started picking up but the number of producers were limited. As a result, the demand exceeded the supply. Selling was no problem. Anybody who could produce the goods was able to sell. The focus of business activities was, therefore, on production of goods. It was believed that profits could be maximised by producing at large scale, thereby reducing the average cost of production. It was also assumed that consumers would favour those products which were widely available at an affordable price. Thus, availability and affordability of the product were considered to be the key to the success of a firm. Therefore, greater emphasis was placed on improving the production and distribution efficiency of the firms.\nthe Product concept\nAs a result of emphasis on production capacit\ny during the earlier days, the \nposition of supply increased over period of time. Mere availability and Marketing versus selling\nMany people confuse ‘selling’ for ‘marketing’. They consider these two terms as one and the same. Marketing refers to a large set of activities of which selling is just one part. For example, a marketer of televisions, before making the sale, does a lot of other activities such as planning the type and model of televisions to be produced, the price at which it would be sold and selecting the distribution outlets at which the same would be available, etc. In short, marketing involves whole range of activities relating to planning, pricing, promoting and distributing the products that satisfy customer’s needs.\nThe function of selling, on the other hand, is restricted to promotion of goods and \nservices through salesmanship, advertising, publicity and short-term incentives so that title of the product is transferred from seller to buyer or in other words product is converted into cash.\nCh_10.indd   248 10-08-2022   10:04:27\n2024-25"

                "text": "MArkeTING\n249\nlow price of the product could not \nensure increased sale and as such the survival and growth of the firm. Thus, with the increase in the supply of the products, customers started looking for products which were superior in quality, performance and features. Therefore, the emphasis of the firms shifted from quantity of production to quality of products. The focus of business activity changed to bringing continuous improvement in the quality, incorporating new features, etc. Thus, product improvement became the key to profit maximisation of a firm, under the concept of product orientation.\nthe selling concept\nWith \nthe passage of time, the marketing \nenvironment underwent further change. The increase in the scale of business further improved the position with respect to supply of goods, resulting in increased competition among sellers. The product quality and availability did not ensure the survival and growth of firms because of the large number of sellers selling quality products. This led to greater importance to attracting and persuading customers to buy the product. The business philosophy changed. It was assumed that the customers would not buy, or not buy enough, unless they are adequately convinced and motivated to do so. Therefore, firms must undertake aggressive selling and promotional efforts to make customers buy their products. The use of promotional techniques such as advertising, personal selling and sales \npromotion were considered essential for selling of products. Thus, the focus of business firms shifted to pushing the sale of products through aggressive selling techniques with a view to persuade, lure or coax the buyers to buy the products. Making sale through any means became important. It was assumed that buyers can be manipulated but what was forgotten was that in the long run what matters most is the customer satisfaction, rather than anything else.\nthe Marketing concept\nMarketing orientati\non implies that \nfocus on satisfaction of customer’s needs is the key to the success of any organisation in the market. It assumes that in the long run an organisation can achieve its objective of maximisation of profit by identifying the needs of its present and prospective buyers and satisfying them in an effective way. All the decisions in a firm are taken from the point of view of the customers. In other words, customer’s satisfaction become the focal point of all decision making in the organisation. For example, what product will be produced, with what features and at what price shall it be sold, or where shall it be made available for sale will depend on what do the customers want. If the customers want features like double door in a refrigerator or a separate provision for water cooler in it, the organisation would produce a refrigerator with these features, would \nCh_10.indd   249 10-08-2022   10:04:27\n2024-25"

If all marketing decisions are taken with this prospective, selling will not be any problem. It will automatically follow. The basic role of a firm then is to ‘identify a need and fill it’. The concept implies that products ad-services are bought not merely because of their quality, packing or brand name, but because they satisfy a specific need of a customer. A pre-requisite for the success of any organisation, therefore, is to understand and respond to customer needs.\nTo sum up, the marketing concept \nis based on the following pillars:(i)\n Identification of market or  \ncustomer who are chosen as the \ntarget of marketing effort.\n(ii) Understanding needs and wants of customers in the target market.\n(iii)\n Development of products or services for satisfying needs of\n \nthe target market.\n(iv) Satisfying needs of target market better than the competitors.\n(v)\n Doing all this at a profit.\nThus, the focus of the marketing \nconcept is on customer needs and the customer satisfaction becomes the means to \nachieving the firms’ objective \nof maximising profit.

It should also consider large issues of long-term social welfare, as illustrated above.\nThe societal marketing concept \nholds that the task of any organisation is to identify the needs and wants of the target market and deliver the desired satisfaction in an effective and efficient manner so that the long- term well-being of the consumers and the society is taken care of. Thus, the societal marketing concept is the extension of the marketing concept as supplemented by the concern for the long-term welfare of the society. Apart from the customer satisfaction, it pays attention to the social, ethical and ecological aspects of marketing. There are large number of such issues that need to be attended.\nFunCTions  oF markeTing\nMarketing is concerned with exchange of goods and services from producers to consumers or users in such a way \nthat maximises the satisfaction of customers’ needs. From the view point of management function, number of activities are involved, which have been described as below:\n1. \ngathering and analysing Market \ninformation: One of the important \nfunctions \nof a marketer is to gather \nand analyse market information. This \nis necessary to identify the needs of the customers and take various decisions for the successful marketing of the products and services. This is important for making an analysis of the available opportunities and threats as well as strengths and weaknesses of the organisation and help in deciding what opportunities can best be pursued by it. For example, rapid growth is predicted in several areas in the Indian economy, say in the use of the Internet, market for cell phones and several other areas. Which of these areas a particular organisation should enter, or in which area should it expand, requires a careful scanning of the strengths and weaknesses of the organisation, which is done with the help of careful market analysis.\nWith the growth of computers, \na new trend has emerged in the \ncollection of market information. More and more companies are using interactive sites on the internet, to gather customer views and opinions, before taking important business decisions. One of the popular TV News Channel (in Hindi) seeks viewers choice (through SMS) on which of the given four or five main news stories \nCh_10.indd   251 10-08-2022   10:04:27\n2024-25"

Marketing Planning: Another \nimportant activity or area of work of a marketer is to develop appropriate marketing plans so that the marketing objectives of the organisation can be achieved. For example a marketer of colour TV, having 10 per cent of the current market share in the country, aims at enhancing his market share to 20 per cent, in the next three years. He will have to develop a complete marketing plan covering various important aspects including the plan for increasing the level of production, promotion of the products, etc., and specify the action programmes to achieve these objectives.\n3.Product Designing and  \nDevelopment : Another important \nmarketing activity or decision area relates to product designing and development. The design of the product contributes to making \nthe product attractive to the target customers. A good design can improve performance of a product and also give it a competitive advantage in the market. For example, when we plan to buy any product say a motorbike, we not only see its features like cost, mileage, but also the design aspects \nlike its shape, style, etc.\n4. \nstandardisation and grading: \nStandardisation \nrefers to producing \ngoods of predetermined specifications, \nwhich helps in achieving uniformity and consistency in the output. \nStandardisation ensures the buyers that goods conform to the predetermined standards of quality, price and packaging and reduces the need for inspection, testing and evaluation of the products.\nGrading is the process of \nclassification of products into different groups, on the basis of some of its important characteristics such as quality, size, etc. Grading is particularly necessary for products which are not produced according to predetermined specifications, such as in the case of agricultural products, say wheat, oranges, etc. Grading ensures that goods belong to a particular quality and helps in realising higher prices for high quality output.\n5. Packaging and Labelling: Packaging \nrefers to designing and developing the \npackage for the products. Labelling refers to designing and developing the label to be put on the package. The label may vary from a simple tag to \ncomplex graphics.\nPackaging and labelling have \nbecome so important in modern day marketing that these are considered as the pillars of marketing. Packaging is important not only for protection of the products but also serves as a promotional tool. Sometimes, the quality of the product is assessed by the buyers form packaging. We have seen that in the success of many of the consumer brands in recent times such as Lays or Uncle Chips potato wafers Clinic Plus shampoos, and Colgate \nCh_10.indd   252 10-08-2022   10:04:27\n2024-25"

Pricing of Product:  Price of \nproduct refers to the amount of money \ncustomers have to pay to obtain a product. Price is an important factor affecting the success or failure of a product in the market. The demand for a product or service is related to its price. Generally lower the price, higher would be the demand for the product and vice-versa. The marketers have to properly analyse the factors determining the price of a product and take several crucial decisions in this respect, including setting the pricing objectives, determining the pricing strategies, determining the price and changing the prices.\n9.  Promotion: Promotion of products \nand services involves informing the customers about the firm’s product, its features, etc., and persuading them to purchase these products. The four important methods of promotion include advertising, Personal Selling, Publicity and Sales Promotion. A marketer has to take several crucial, decisions in respect of promotion of the products and services such as deciding the promotion budget, the promotion mix, i.e., the combination of the promotional tools that will be use, the promotion budget, etc.\n10.  Physical Distribution: Managing \nphysical distribution is another very important function in the Toothpaste, etc., packaging has played \nan important role.\n6. \nbranding:\n A very important decision \narea for marketing of most consumer \nproducts is whether to sell the product in its generic name (name of the category of the product, say Fan, Pen, etc.) or to sell them in a brand name (such as Pollar Fan or \nrottomac Pen). \nBrand name helps in creating product differenti\nation, i.e., providing basis for \ndistinguishing the product of a firm with that of the competitor, which in turn, helps in building customer’s loyality and in promoting its sale. The important decision areas in respect of branding include deciding the branding strategy, say whether each product will be given a separate brand name or the same brand name will be extended to all products of the company, say Phillips bulbs, tubes and television or Videocon washing machine, television, and refrigerator. Selection of the brand name plays an important role in the success of a product.\n7. \ncustomer support services: \nA very important function of the \nmarketing \nmanagement relates \nto developing customer support services such as after sales services, handling customer complaints and adjustments, procuring credit services, maintenance services, technical services and consumer information. All these services aim at providing maximum satisfaction to the customers, which is the key to marketing success in modern days. \nCh_10.indd   253 10-08-2022   10:04:27\n2024-25"

The important decision areas under physical distribution include managing inventory (levels of stock of goods), storage and warehousing and transportation of goods from one place to the other.\n11. \ntransportation: Transportation\n \ninvolves physical movement of goods \nfrom one place to the other. As generally the users of products, particularly consumer products are wide spread and geographically separated from the place these are produced, it is necessary to move them to the place where it is needed for consumption or use, For example, tea produced in Assam has to be transported not only within the state but to other far off places like Tamil Nadu, Punjab, Jammu and \nkashmir \nand Haryana, rajasthan, where it is \nconsumed.\nA marketing \nfirm has to analyse \nits transportation needs after taking \ninto consideration various factors such as nature of the product, cost and location of target market and take decisions in respect of mode of transportation to be chosen and other related aspects.12. \nstorage or Warehou sing: \nUsually there is a time gap between \nthe production or procurement of goods and their sale or use. It may be because of irregular demand for the products such as in the case of woollen garments or raincoats, or there may be irregular supply because of seasonal production such as in the case of agricultural products (sugarcane, rice, wheat, cotton, etc.). In order to maintain smooth flow of products in the market, there is a need for proper storage of the products. Further, there is a need for storage of adequate stock of goods to protect against unavoidable delays in delivery or to meet out contingencies in the demand. In the process of marketing, the function of storage is performed by different agencies such as manufacturers, wholesalers and retailers.\nmarkeTing  mix\nThe marketing mix consists of various \nelements, which have broadly been classified into four categories, popularly known as four Ps of marketing. These are: (i) Product, (ii) Price, (iii) Place, and (iv) Promotion. These are briefly discussed as follows:\n1. Product: Product means goods \nor services or ‘anything of value’, which is offered to the market for sale. For example, Hindustan lever offers number of consumer products like toiletries (Close-Up toothpaste, Lifebuoy soap, etc.), detergent powder (Surf, Wheel), food products (Refined \nCh_10.indd   254 10-08-2022   10:04:27\n2024-25"

The concept of product also include the extended product or what is offered to the customers by way of after sales services, handling complaints, availability of spare parts etc. These aspects are very important, \nparticularly in the marketing of consumer durable products (like Automobiles, refrigerators, etc.). The important product decisions include deciding about the features, quality, packaging, labelling and branding of the products.\n2. Price: Price is the amount of money \ncustomers have to pay to obtain the product. In case of most of the products, level of price affects the level of their demand. The marketers have not only to decide about the objectives of price setting but to analyse the factors determining the price and fix a price for the firm’s products. Decisions have also to be taken in respect of discounts to customers, traders and credit terms, etc., so that customers \nMarketing Mix: elements\nProduct  Price\nProduct Mix  Price Level\nProduct Quality  Margins\nNew Product  Pricing Policy\nDesign and Development  Pricing Strategies\nPackaging  Price Change\nLabelling\nBranding\nPlace  Promotion\nChannel Strategy  Promotion Mix\nChannel Selection  Advertising\nChannel Conflict  Personal Selling\nChannel Cooperation  Sales Promotion\nPhysical Distribution  Publicity\n Public relations\nCh_10.indd   255 10-08-2022   10:04:27\n2024-25"

Place: Place or Physical Distribution \ninclude activities that make firm’s products available to the target customers. Important decision areas in this respect include selection of dealers or intermediaries to reach the customers, providing support to the intermediaries (by way of discounts, promotional campaigns, etc.). The intermediaries in turn keep inventory of the firm’s products, demonstrate them to potential buyers, negotiate price with buyers, close sales and also service the products after the sale. The other decision areas relate to managing inventory, storage and warehousing and transportation of goods from the place it is produced to the place it is required by the buyers.\n4. Promotion: Promotion of products \nand services include activities that communicate availability, features, merits, etc., of the products to the target customers and persuade them to buy it. Most marketing organisations, undertake various promotional activities and spend substantial amount of money on the promotion of their goods through using number of tools such as advertising, personal selling and sales promotion techniques (like price discounts, free samples, etc.). A large number of decisions are to be taken in each of the area specified above. For example, in the respect of advertising it is important to decide about the message, the media to be used (example, print-media–newspaper, magazines, the objections \nof customers, etc.).\nThe success of a market offer will \ndepend on how well these ingredients are mixed to create superior value for the customers and simultaneously achieve their sale and profit objectives. Let us say a firm would like to achieve necessary volume of sale at a cost that will permit a desired level of profit. But so many alternative mixes can be adopted by a firm to achieve this objectives. The issue before a firm then is to decide what would be the most effective combination of elements to achieve the given objectives.\nproDuCTs\nFrom the customer’s point of view, a product is a bundle of utilities, which is purchased because of its capability to provide satisfaction of certain need. \nA buyer buys a product or service \nfor what it does for her or the benefit it provides to her. There can be three types of benefits a customer may seek to satisfy from the purchase of a product, viz., \n(i)\n  functional benefits, \n(ii)  psychological benefits, and \n(iii)  social benefits. \nFor example, the purchase of a motorcycle provides functional utility of transportation, but at the same time \nsatisfies the need for prestige and \nesteem and provides social benefit by the way of acceptance from a group, by riding a motorbike. Thus, all these aspects should be considered while planning for a product.\nCh_10.indd   256 10-08-2022   10:04:27\n2024-25"

The consumer products may further be classified into different groups, as detailed below:\nConsumer  proDuCTs\nProducts, which are purchased by the ultimate consumers or users for satisfying their personal needs and desires are referred to as consumer products. For example, soap, edible oil, eatables, textiles, toothpaste, fans, etc. which we use for our personal and non-business use are consumer goods. We can classify the consumer product into the following three categories as here under:1. \nconvenience Products: Those \nc\nonsumer products, which are purchased \nfrequently, immediately and with least time \nand efforts are referred to as convenience goods. \nexamples \nof such products \nare cigarettes, ice creams, medicines, newspaper, stationery items toothpaste etc. These products have low unit-value and are bought in small qualities.\n2. \nshopping Products: Shopping \nproducts are those consumer goods \nwhere buyers devote considerable \ntime, to compare the quality, price, style, suitability, etc., at several stores, before making final purchase.

These products are such, which have reached a brand loyalty of the highest order, with a significant number of buyers. The buyers are willing to spend a lot of time and efforts on the purchase of such products. For example, if there is a rare collection of artwork or of antiques, some people may be willing to spend a lot of shopping effort and travel long distance to buy such products. In our day-to-day life, we see people going to a particular hair-cutting saloon or restaurant, or a tailor. The demand for these goods is relatively inelastic, i.e., even if the price is increased, the demand does not come down.DuraBiliTy  oF proDuCTs\nOn the basis of their durability, \nthe consumer products have been classified into three categories— Durable, Non-durable and Services.\n1. \nnon-durable Products: The\n \nconsumer products which are \nnormally consumed in one or few uses are called non-durable products.

He has to decide whether the firm’s products will be marketed under a brand name or a generic name. Generic name refers to the name of the whole class of the product. For example, a book, a wristwatch, tyre, camera, toilet soap, etc. We know that a camera is a lens surrounded by plastic or steel from all sides and having certain other features such as a flash gun and so on. Similarly book is a bunch of papers, which are in a bound form, on which some useful information about a subject is printed. Thus, all products having these characteristics would be called by the generic name such as camera or book.If products were sold by generic \nnames, it would be very difficult for the \nmarketers to distinguish their products from that of their competitors. Thus, most marketers give a name to their product, which helps in identifying and distinguishing their products from the competitors’ products. This process of giving a name or a sign or a symbol etc., to a product is called branding. The various terms relating to branding are as follows:\n1. \nbrand: A brand is \na name, term, sign, \nsymbol, design or some combination of \nthem, used to identify the products—goods or services of one seller or group of sellers and to differentiate them from those of the competitors. For example, some of the common brands are Bata, Lifebuoy, Dunlop, and Parker.

In other words, brand name is the verbal component of a brand.\n3. Brand Mark: That part of a brand \nwhich can be recognised but which is not utterable is called brand mark. It appears in the form of a symbol, design, distinct colour scheme or lettering.\n4. Trade Mark: A brand or part of a \nbrand that is given legal protection is called trademark. The protection is given against its use by other firms. Thus the firm, which got its brand registered, gets the exclusive right for its use. In that case, no other firm can use such name or mark in the country.\nThough branding adds to the cost \ne.g., to the cost of packaging, labelling, legal protection, and promotion, it provides several advantages to the sellers as well as the consumers.\nCharacteristics of Good Brand Name\nChoosing the right brand name is \nnot an easy decision. What makes this decision important is the fact that once a brand name is chosen and the product is launched in the market, changing the brand name is very difficult. So, getting it right the first time is very essential.  \nFollowing are some of the considerations, \nwhich should be kept in mind while choosing a brand name.\n(i)\n The brand name should be short, easy to pronounce, spell, recognise and remember e.g., Ponds, VIP, Rin, Vim, etc.(ii)\n A brand should suggest t\nhe \nproduct’s benefits and qualities. \nIt should be appropriate to the product’s function.\n(iii)\n A brand name should be distinctive.\n(iv) The brand name should be\n \nadaptable to packing or labelling requirements, to different advertising media and to different languages.\n(v)\n The brand name should  be suffici\nently  versatile to \naccommodate new products, which are added to the product line.\n(vi)\n It should be capable of being registered and protected legally.\n(vii)\n Chosen name should have staying power i.e., it should not get out of date.\nPackaging\nOne of the most important developments affecting the business world in recent years has been in the area of packaging. Many products, which we thought could never lend themselves to packing because of their nature, have been successfully packed e.g., Pulses, Ghee, Milk, Salt, Cold Drinks, etc. Packaging refers to the act of designing and producing the container or wrapper of a product. Packaging plays a very important role in the marketing success or failure of many products, particularly the consumer non-durable products. In fact if one makes an analysis of the reasons for the success of some of the successful \nCh_10.indd   262 2/6/2024   10:04:04 AM\n2024-25"

For example, it was one of the important factors in the success of products like Maggie’s Noodles, Uncle Chips or Crax wafers.\nLevels of Packaging\nThere can be three different levels of \npackaging. These are as below:\n1. Primary Package: It refers to the \nproduct’s immediate container. In some cases, the primary package is kept till the consumer is ready to use the product (e.g., plastic packet for socks); whereas in other cases, it is kept throughout the entire life of the product (e.g., a toothpaste tube, a match box, etc.).\n2. Secondary Packaging : It refers to \nadditional layers of protection that are \nkept till the product is ready for use, e.g., a tube of shaving cream usually comes in a card board box. When consumers start using the shaving cream, they will dispose off the box but retain the primary tube.\n3. Transportation Packaging: It refers \nto further packaging components necessary for storage, identification or transportation. For example, a toothpaste manufacturer may send the goods to retailers in corrugated boxes containing 10, 20, or 100 units.\nLevels of Packaging\nCh_10.indd   263 1/23/2024   05:45:40 PM\n2024-25"

Because of this, \nsome of the traditional role \nassigned to personal selling in respect of promotion has gone to packaging.\n(iii)\n Innovational Opportunity: Some of the r\necent developments in the \narea of packaging have completely changed the marketing scene in the country. For example, milk can now be stored for 4-5 days without refrigeration in the recently developed packing materials. Similarly, in the area of pharmaceuticals, soft drinks, etc., lots of new innovations have come in respect of packaging. As a result, the scope for the marketing of such products has increased.\n(iv)\n Product\n Differentiation: Packaging \nis one of the very important means \nof creating product differentiation. The colour, size, material, etc., of package makes real difference in the perception of customers about the \nquality of the product. For example, by looking at the package of a product say Paint or Hair Oil, one can make some guess about quality \nof the product contained in it.\nFunctions of Packaging\nAs stated above, packaging performs a \nnumber of functions in the marketing of goods. Some of the important functions are as follows:\n(i)\n Product Identification: Packaging greatly helps in identification of the products. For example, Colgate in red colour, or Ponds\n \ncream jar can be easily identified by its package.\n(ii)\n Product Protection: Packaging protects the contents of a product from spoilage, breakage, leakage, pilferage, damage, climatic \neffect, \netc. This kind of protection is required during storing, distribution and transportation of the product.\n(iii)\n Facilitating Use of the Product: The size and shape \nof the package \nshould be such that it should be convenient to open, handle and use for the consumers. Cosmetics, medicines and tubes of toothpastes are good examples of this.\n(iv)\n Product Promotion: Packaging is also used \nfor promotion purposes. \nA startling colour scheme, photograph or typeface may be used to attract attention of the people at the point of purchase. Sometimes it may work even better \nCh_10.indd   264 1/23/2024   05:45:40 PM\n2024-25"

In self-service \nstores, this role of packaging becomes all the more important.\nLabelling\nA simple looking but important task \nin the marketing of goods relates to designing the label to be put on the package. The label may vary from a simple tag attached to the product (such as in case of local unbranded products like sugar, wheat, pulses, etc.) indicating some information about the quality or price, to complex graphics that are part of the package, like the ones on branded products. Lables are useful in providing detailed information about the product, its contents, method of use, etc. The various functions performed by a label are as follows:\n1. Describe the Product and specify \nits contents: Let us look at some of the labels of the products used by us in our day to day life. The label on the package of a local tea company describes the company as ‘Mohini Tea Company, an ISO 9001:200C Certified Company’; a popular brand of Prickly Heat Powder, describes how the product provides relief from prickly heat and controls bacterial growth and infection, giving caution forbidding its application on cuts and wounds. Package of fast food products like ready to eat Dosa, Idli or Noodles, describe the procedure of cooking these products; the Package of a toothpaste brand lists the ‘Ten Teeth and Gum Problems’, which the product claims to fight with its ‘Complete Germicheck Formula’; the Package of a brand of Coconut Oil describes the product as pure coconut oil with Heena, Amla, Lemon and specifies how these are good for Hair. Thus, one of the most important functions of labels is to describe the product, its usage, cautions in use, etc. and specify its contents.\n2. Identification of the Product \nor brand: The other important function performed by labels is to help in identifying the product or brand. For example, the brand name of any product, say Biscuits or Potato Chips imprinted on its package helps us to identify, from number of packages, which one is our favourite brand. Other common identification information provided by the labels include name and address of the manufacturer, net weight when packed, manufacturing date, maximum retail price and Batch number.\n3. Grading of Products: Another \nimportant function performed by labels is to help grading the products into different categories. Sometimes marketers assign different grades to indicate different features or quality of the product. For example, a popular brand of Hair Conditioners comes in different categories for different hair, say for ‘normal hair’ and for other categories. Different type of tea is sold by some brands under Yellow, red and Green Label categories.\n4.

We see many product labels providing promotional messages for example, the pack of a popular Amla Hair Oil states, ‘Baalon mein Dum, Life mein Fun’. The label on the package of a brand of Detergent Powder says, ‘keep cloth look good and your machine in top condition’. Labels play important role in sales promotional schemes launched by companies. For example the label on the package of a Shaving Cream mentions, ‘40% Extra Free’ or package of a toothpaste mentioning, ‘Free Toothbrush Inside’, or ‘Save `\n 15’.\n5. Providing Information Required by Law : \nAnother important function \nof labeling is to provide information required by law. For example, packaged food articles must have list of ingredients declaration regarding vegetarian or non-vegetarian food additives and date of manufacturing or packing on the label. Such information is required on processed foods, drugs and tobacco products. In case of hazardous or poisonous material, appropriate safety-warning need to be put on the label.\nThus, labels perform number \nof important functions relating to communicating with the potential buyers and promoting the sale of the products.\nPricing\nWhen a product is bought, some \nmoney is paid for it. This money represent the sum of values that \nconsumers exchange for the benefit of having or using the product and is referred to as the price of the product. Similarly, money paid for the services such as fare for the transport service, premium for an insurance policy, and fee to a doctor for his medical advise represent the price of these services. Price may therefore be defined as the amount of money paid by a buyer (or received by a seller) in consideration of the purchase of a product or  \na services. \nPricing occupies an important \nplace in the marketing of goods and services by a firm. No product can be launched without a price tag or at least some guidelines for pricing. Pricing is often used as a regulator of the demand of a product. Generally, if the price of a product is increased, its demand comes down, and  \nvice-versa.\nPricing is considered to be an \neffective competitive weapon. In the conditions of perfect competition, most of the firms compete with each other on the basis of this factor. It is also the single most important factor affecting the revenue and profits of a firm. Thus, most marketing firms give high importance to the fixation of price for their products and services.\nFactors affecting Price \nDetermination\nThere are number of factors which affect the fixation of the price of a product. Some of the important factors in this regard are discussed as below:\nCh_10.indd   266 1/23/2024   05:45:40 PM\n2024-25"

                "text": "MARkETING\n267\n1. Product cost : One of the most \nimportant factor affecting price \nof a product or service is its cost. This includes the cost of producing, distributing and selling the product. The cost sets the minimum level or the floor price at which the product may be sold. Generally all marketing firms strive to cover all their costs, at least in the long run. In addition, they aim at earning a margin of profit over and above the costs. In certain circumstance, for example, at the time of introducing a new product or while entering a new market, the products may be sold at a price, which does not cover all the costs. But in the long run, a firm cannot survive unless at least all its costs are covered.\nThere are broadly three types of \ncosts: viz., Fixed Costs, Variable Costs and Semi Variable Costs. Fixed costs are those costs, which do not vary with the level of activity of a firm say with the volume of production or sale. For example, rent of a building or salary of a sales manager remains the same whether 1000 units or 10 units are produced in a week.\nThose costs which vary in direct \nproportion with the level of activity are called variable costs. For example, the costs of raw material, labour and power are directly related with the quantity of goods produced. Let us say, if the cost \nof wood for manufacturing one chair comes to `\n 100 the cost of wood for 10 \nchairs would be ` 1000. Obviously, \nthere will be no cost of wood if no chair is produced.S\n emi variable costs are those costs \nwhich vary with the level of activity \nbut not in direct proportion with it. For example, compensation of a sales person may include a fixed salary of say `\n 10,000 plus a commission of 5 \nper cent on sales. With an increase in the v\nolume of sales, the total \ncompensation will increase but not in direct proportion with the change in the volume of sale.\nTotal Costs are the sum total of the \nfixed, variable and semi-variable costs for the specific level of activity, say volume of sales or quantity produced.\n2. The Utility and Demand: While \nthe product costs set the lower limits of the price, the utility provided by the product and the intensity of demand of the buyer sets the upper limit of price, which a buyer would be prepared to pay. In fact the price must reflect the interest of both the parties to the transaction—the buyer and the seller. The buyer may be ready to pay up to the point where the utility from the product is at least equal to the sacrifice made in terms of the price paid. The seller would, however, try to at least cover the costs. According to the law of demand, consumers usually purchase more units at a low price than at a high price.\n3. Extent of Competition in the \nMarket: Between the lower limit and the upper limit where would the price settle down? This is affected by the nature and the degree of competition. The price will tend to reach the upper limit in case there is lesser degree of \nCh_10.indd   267 1/23/2024   05:45:40 PM\n2024-25"

Not only the price but the quality and the features of the competitive products must be examined carefully, before fixing the price.\n4. Government and Legal Regulations: \nIn order to protect the interest of public against unfair practices in the field of price fixing, Government can intervene and regulate the price of commodities. Government can declare a product as essential product and regulate its price. For example, the cost of a drug manufactured by a company having monopoly in the production of the same come to `\n 20 per strip \nof ten \nand the buyer is prepared to pay any amount for it, say `\n 200. In the absence \nof any competitor, the seller may be tempted \nto extort the maximum \namount of ` 200 for the drug \nand \nintervene to regulate the price. Usually in such a case, the Government does not allow the firms to charge such a high price and intervene to regulate the price of the drug. This can be done by the Government by declaring the drug as essential commodity and regulating its price.\n5. Pricing Objectives: Pricing \nobjectives are another important factor affecting the fixation of the price of a product or a service. Generally the objective is stated to be maximise the profits. But there is a difference in maximising profit in the short run and in the long run. If the firm decides to maximise profits in the short run, it would tend to charge maximum price for its products. But if it is to maximise its total profit in the long run, it would opt for a lower per unit price so that it can capture larger share of the market and earn greater profits through increased sales.\nApart from profit maximisation, \nthe pricing objectives of a firm may include:(a) Obtaining Market Share Leadership: \nIf a firms objective is to obtain larger share of the market; it will keep the price of its products at lower levels so that greater number of people are attracted to purchase the products;\n(b)\n Surviving in a Competitive Market: If \na firm is facing difficulties in \nsurviving in the market because of intense competition or introduction of a more efficient substitute by a competitor, it may resort to discounting its products or running a promotion campaign to liquidate its stock; and\n(c)\n Attaining Product Quali\nty \nLeadership: In this case, normally \nhigher prices are charged to cover high quality and high cost of research and Development.\nThus, the price of a firm’s products \nand services is affected by the pricing \nobjective of the firm.\n6. Marketing Methods Used : Price \nfixation process is also affected by \nother elements of marketing such \nCh_10.indd   268 1/23/2024   05:45:40 PM\n2024-25"

For example, if a company provides free home delivery, it has some of flexibility in fixing prices. Similarly, uniqueness of any of the elements mentioned above gives the company a competitive freedom in fixing prices of its products.\nPhysical  Distribution\nThe fourth important element \nof marketing mix is the physical distribution of products and services. Through this component of marketing mix, the goods and services are made available at right place, at right time to right people without change.\nOnce goods are manufactured, \npackaged, branded, priced, and promoted, these must be made \navailable to customers at the ri ght \nplace, in right quantity and at the right time. For example, a person convinced about the quality, etc. of a product, say, a detergent bar, wants to purchase the same. He/She goes to a retail outlet and asks for the product. If that product is not available in that shop, he/she may purchase some of the alternative brand available. This way a sure sale is lost because goods were not available at the place where the customer wanted to purchase. Thus, it is an important responsibility of the marketers to make the product physically available at a place where the customers would like them to buy. The physical handling and movement of goods from place of production to the place of distribution is referred to as physical distribution, which is a very important element of marketing mix.\nCh_10.indd   269 1/23/2024   05:45:41 PM\n2024-25"

Important activities involved in the physical distribution include transportation, warehousing, material handling, and inventory control. These activities constitute major components of physical distribution.\nComponents of Physical \nDistribution\nThe main components of physical \ndistribution are explained as follows:\n1. Order Processing: In a typical \nbuyer-seller relationship, order placement is the first step. Products flow from manufacturers to customers via channel members while orders flow in the reverse direction, from customers to the manufacturers. A \ngood physical distribution system should provide for an accurate and speedy processing of orders, in the absence of which, goods would reach the customers late or in wrong quantity or specifications. This would result in customer dissatisfaction, with the danger of loss of business and goodwill.\n2. Transportation: Transportation is \nthe means of carrying goods and raw materials from the point of production to the point of sale. It is one of the major elements in the physical distribution of goods. It is important because unless the goods are physically made available, the sale cannot  \nbe completed.\n3. Warehousing : Warehousing refers \nto the act of storing and assorting \nNothing Beats Word of Mouth in India\nNothing sways an Indian buyer’s choice more than a word of reassurance from \nthe people he knows. Even for the purchases like cars, mobile phones and home loans, majority of the consumers in India rely on the references from their friends and relatives while making their decisions.\nThe story is different in developed economies. Take the case of automobiles. \nIn markets like the US, Canada and Japan, more people are influenced by conventional advertising by automobile companies, in developing markets like India, Malaysia and Thailand it’s the neighbour or the colleague who tips the scales one way or the other. “In case of luxury goods, the psyche of Indians has always been different. Buying a car is a family decision, so it is only natural that all the members of the family will talk to all the other users of a similar products, who they know”, General Motors India director P Balendran said.\nWhen the whole world is going crazy with Internet and mobile marketing, it is \ninteresting that for Indians it’s still conventional advertising and word of mouth campaigns that sways their choices. Unlike in the West, Indians come from a very closely-knit society where people get influenced by their peers, relatives and local celebrities. People are more than willing to accept a brand if it’s endorsed by their favourite superstar or is recommended by their close associates.\nCh_10.indd   270 1/23/2024   05:45:41 PM\n2024-25"

The basic purpose of warehousing activities is to arrange placement of goods and provide facilities to store them. The need for warehousing arises because there may be difference between the time a product is produced and the time it is required for consumption. Generally the efficiency of a firm in serving its customers will depend on where these warehouses are located and where are these to be delivered.\nGenerally larger the number \nof warehouses a firm has, lesser would be the time taken in serving customers at different locations but greater would be the cost of warehousing and vice-versa. Thus the firm has to strike a balance between the cost of warehousing and the level of customer service.\nFor products requiring long- \nterm storage (such as agricultural products) the warehouses are located near production sites. This helps in minimising the charges on transportation of the goods. On the other hand, the products which are bulky and hard to ship (machinery, automobiles) as well as perishable products (bakery, meat, vegetables) are kept at different locations near the market.4. Inventory Control: Linked to warehousing decisions are the inventory decisions which hold key to success for many manufacturers, especially those where the per unit cost is high. A very important decision in respect of inventory is deciding about the level of inventory. Higher the level of inventory, higher will be the \nlevel of service to customers but the cost of carrying the inventory will also be high because lot of capital would be tied up in the stock. Thus, a balance is to be maintained in respect of the cost and customer satisfaction. \nPromotion\nA company may produce a good quality product, price it appropriately and make it available at the selling points, which are convenient to customers. But in spite of all this, the product may not sell well in the market. There is a need for developing proper communication with the market. In the absence of communication, the customers would not be able to know about the product and how it can satisfy their needs and wants or may not be convinced about its utility and benefits.\nPromotion refers to the use of \ncommunication with the twin objective of informing potential customers about a product and persuading them to buy it. In other words, promotion is an important element of marketing mix by which marketers makes use of various tools of communication to encourage exchange of goods and services in the market.\nPromotion  mix\nPromotion mix refers to combination of promotional tools used by an organisation to achieve its  communication objectives. Various tools of communication are used \nCh_10.indd   271 1/23/2024   05:45:41 PM\n2024-25"

These include: (i) Advertising, (ii) Personal Selling, (iii) Sales Promotion, and (iv) Publicity. These tools are also called elements of promotion mix and can be used in different combinations, to achieve the goals of promotion. For example, consumer goods firms may use more of advertising through mass media while the industrial goods firms may be using more of personal selling. What combination of these elements is used by a firm will depend upon various factors such as nature of market, nature product, the promotions budget, objectives of promotion, etc. Let us first know about these elements in some details.\naDvertising\nWe generally come across hundreds of advertising messages everyday, which tell us about various products such as toilet soaps, detergent powder, soft drinks and services such as hotels, insurance policies, etc.Advertising is perhaps the most \ncommonly used tool of promotion. It is \nan impersonal form of communication, which is paid for by the marketers (sponsors) to promote some goods or service. The most common modes of advertising are  ‘newspapers’, ‘magazines’, ‘television’, and ‘radio’. The important distinguishing features of advertising are as follows:\n(i) Paid Form: Advertising is a paid \nform of communication. That is, the sponsor has to bear the cost of communicating with the prospects.\n(ii) Impersonality: There is no direct \nface-to-face contact between the prospect and the advertiser. It is therefore, referred to as impersonal method of promotion. Advertising creates a monologue and not a dialogue.\n(iii) Identified Sponsor: Advertising \nis undertaken by some identified individual or company, who makes the advertising efforts and also bears the cost of it.

For example, an advertisement message placed in a national daily reaches lakhs of its subscribers.\n(ii) Enhancing Customer Satisfaction \nand Confidence: \nadvertising \ncreates confidence \namongst \nprospective buyers as they feel \nmore comfortable and assured about the product quality and hence feel more satisfied.\n(iii)\n Expressiveness: With the  \ndevelopments \nin art, computer \ndesigns, and graphics, advertising \nhas developed into one of the most forceful medium of communication. With the special effects that can be created, even simple products and messages can look very attractive.\n(iv) Economy: \nadvertising is a very \neconomical mode of communication \nif \nlarge number of people are to be \nreached. Because of its wide reach, the overall cost of advertising gets spread over numerous communication links established. \nas a result the per-unit cost of \nreach comes low. \nObjectiOns  tO Advertising\nthough advertising is one of the most \nfrequently used medium of promotion of goods \nand services, it attracts \nlot of criticism. the opponents of \nadvertising say \nthat the expenditure \non advertising is a social waste as it \nadds to the cost, multiplies the needs of people and undermines social values. \nthe proponents, however, \nargue that advertising is very useful as it increases the reach, brings the pay unit cost \nof production down and \nadds to the growth of the economy. it \nis therefore, important to examine the major criticisms against advertising and see the extent \nto which these are \ntrue. this is taken up as follows:\n1. Adds to Cost: the opponents of \nadvertising argue that advertising\n \nunnecessarily adds to the cost of product, which is ultimately passed on to the buyers in the form of high prices. \nan advertisement \non tV, for\n \na few seconds, for example, costs the marketers several lakhs of rupees. Similarly an advertisement in print media say in a newspaper or a magazine costs the marketers a large amount of money. \nthe money spent adds to the \ncost, which in an important \nfactor in \nfixation of the price of a product.\ntrue, advertisement of a \nproduct \ncosts lot of money but it helps to \nincrease the demand for the product as large number of potential buyers come to know about the availability of the products, its features, etc. and are persuaded to buy it. \nthe increased \ndemand leads to higher production, which brings with it the economies of scale. \nas a result, the per unit cost \nof production comes down as the total cost is divided by larger number \nCh_10.indd   273 2/6/2024   10:12:03 AM\n2024-25"

Thus, the expenditure on \nadvertisement adds to the total cost but the per unit cost comes down, which in fact lessens the burden of consumers rather than adding  \nto it.\n2. Undermines Social Values : Another \nimportant criticism of advertising \nis that it undermines social values and promotes materialism. It breeds discontent among people as they come to know about new products and feel dissatisfied with their present state of affairs. Some advertisements show new life styles, which don’t find social approval.\nThis criticism is not entirely true. \nAdvertisement in fact helps buyers \nby informing them about the new products, which may be improvement over the existing products. If the buyers are not informed about these products, they may be using inefficient products. Further, the job of an advertisement is to inform. The final choice to buy or not to buy anyway rests with the buyers. They will buy if the advertised product satisfies some of their needs. They may be motivated to work harder to be able to purchase these products.\n3. Confuses the Buyers:  Another \ncriticism against advertisement is that \nso many products are being advertised which makes similar claims that the buyer gets confused as to which one is true and which one should be relied upon. For example, we may note similar claims of whiteness or stain removing abilities in competing brands of detergent powder or claims of whiteness of tooth or ‘feelings of freshness’ in competing brands of toothpaste that it is sometimes confusing to us as to which one to buy.\nThe supporters of advertisement, \nhowever, argue that we are all rational \nhuman beings who make our decisions for purchase of products on factors such as price, style, size, etc. Thus the buyers can clear their confusion by analysing the information provided on the advertisements and other sources before taking a decision to purchase a product. However, this criticism cannot be completely overruled.\n4. Encourages Sale of Inferior \nProducts : Advertising does not \ndistinguish between superior and \ninferior products and persuade people to purchase even the inferior products.\nIn fact superiority and inferiority \ndepends on the quality, which is a relative concept. The desired level of quality will depend on the economic status and preferences of the target customers. Advertisements sell products of a given quality and the buyers will buy if it suits their requirements. No advertisement should however, make false claim about the quality of a product. If a firm makes a false claims it can be prosecuted for the same.\nPersonal  selling\nPersonal selling involves oral \npresentation of message in the form of conversation with one or more prospective customers for the purpose \nCh_10.indd   274 1/23/2024   05:45:41 PM\n2024-25"

The public relations department then has to do something drastic so that damage to company’s images is controlled and minimised. They also advise top management to adopt certain programmes which will add to their public image and ensure that negative publicity does not take place at all.\nRole of Public Relations\nThe role of public relations can \nbe discussed with respect to the functions which the department performs. Public relations itself is an important tool in the hands of the marketing department, which can be used to the advantage of the business. The public relations department performs five functions:\n1.\n Publicity:  Publicity is similar \nto advertising, in the sense \nthat \nit is a non-personal form \nof communication. However, as against advertising it is a non-paid form of communication. Publicity generally takes place when favourable news is presented in the mass media about a product or service. For example, if a manufacturer achieves a breakthrough by developing a car engine, which runs on water instead of petrol, and this news is covered by television or radio or newspapers in the form of a news item. It would be termed as publicity because the engine manufacturer would benefit from or opinion is equally important. \nThis public may be interested in the company and its product and have an impact on the business ability to achieve its objectives. Thus, it becomes imperative to manage public opinion and the company’s relation with the public on a regular basis. Therefore, public relations involve a variety of programmes designed to promote or protect a company’s image and its individual products in the eyes of the public.\nThe business relates with a \nnumber of groups including suppliers, shareholders, intermediaries, activist groups, and the government. For example, active support of middlemen is needed if the firm wants to survive in a competitive selling environment. Similarly, consumer activist groups need to be satisfied because they can impose restriction on the sales of the firm’s products directly by urging customers to refrain from buying them or through the imposition of laws. Most organisations, business or otherwise nowadays, have a separate department to manage public relations. They may \nalso utilize the services of any outside public relations agency.\nTheir main task is to disseminate \ninformation and build goodwill about the business. Concrete steps are to be taken to monitor the attitude of the general public and generate positive publicity. They are especially useful when there is negative publicity about the company or its products. At that time, the situation has to be tackled \nCh_10.indd   280 1/23/2024   05:45:41 PM\n2024-25"

Thus, the two important features of publicity are that:\n(i)\n Publicity is an unpaid form of \ncommunication. It does not involve any direct exp\nenditure by the \nmarketing firm; and\n(ii) There is no identified sponsor \nfor \nthe communication as the message goes as a news item.\nIn publicity, as the information \nis disseminated by an independent \nsource, e.g., the press in the form of news stories and features, the message has more credibility than if that comes as a sponsored message in advertising.\n2.\n Press release: Information about \nthe or\nganisation needs to be \npresented in a positive manner in the press. Generating news requires skill in developing and researching a story and getting the media to accept press releases is a difficult task. The public relations department is in contact with the media to present true facts and a correct picture about the company. Otherwise news can get distorted if taken from other sources.\n3.\n Corporate communication: The image of the organisation needs to be promoted th\nrough \ncommunicating with the public and the employees within the organisation. This is usually done with the help of newsletter, annual reports, brochures, articles and audio-visual materials. Companies rely on these materials to reach and influence their target markets. Speeches by the company’s executives at a meeting of trade associations or trade fairs can really boost the company’s image. even interviews with TV channels and responding to queries from the media go a long way in promoting \npublic relations.\n4.\n Lobbying: The organisation has \nto deal\n with government officials \nand different ministers in charge of corporate affairs, industry, finance with respect to policies relating to business and the economy. The government also seeks to maintain a healthy relationship with associations of commerce and industry and solicits the opinion of major stakeholders while formulating industrial, telecom, taxation policies, etc. The public relations department then has to be really proactive in promoting or decoding regulations that affect them.\n5 .\n Counselling: The public  rel\nations department advises the \nmanagement on general issues which affect the public and the position the company would like to the take on a particular issue. The company can build goodwill by contributing money and time to certain causes like environment, wildlife, children’s rights, education, etc. Such cause-related activities help in promoting public relations and building goodwill.\nCh_10.indd   281 1/23/2024   05:45:41 PM\n2024-25"

It includes many activities \nthat are performed even before goods are actually produced and continue even after the goods have been sold.\nFunctions of Marketing: The important functions of marketing include \nGathering and Analysing Market Information, Marketing Planning, Product Designing and Development, Standardisation and Grading, Packaging and Labelling, Branding, Customer Support Services, Pricing of Products, Promotion, Physical distribution, Transportation, Storage or Warehousing.\nRole of Marketing: By adopting marketing orientation, an organisation whether \nprofit making or non-profit making, can achieve its goals in the most effective \nmanner. Also marketing acts as a catalyst in the economic development of a country and helps in raising the standards of living of people.\nMarketing Mix: is a set of marketing tools that the firm uses to pursue its \nmarketing objectives in a target market. The variables or elements of marketing \nmix have been classified in to four categories, popularly known as four Ps of marketing viz., Product, Price, Place and Promotion. These elements are combined to create an offer.\nProduct In common parlance, the word ‘product’, is used to refer only to the \nphysical or tangible attributes of a product. In marketing, product is a mixture of tangible and intangible attributes, which are capable of being exchanged for a value, with ability to satisfy customer needs. It is anything that can be offered to a market to satisfy a want or need. Products may broadly be classified into two categories—industrial products and consumers’ products. Products, which are purchased, by the ultimate consumers or users for satisfying their personal needs and desires are referred to as consumer products. On the basis of shopping efforts involved, the products are classified as Convenience Product, Shopping Products and Speciality Products. On the basis of their durability, consumer products have been classified into categories—Durable, Non-durable, and Services.Those activities, benefits or satisfactions, which are offered for sale, e.g., dry cleaning, watch repairs, hair cutting, are called services.Industrial products are those products, which are used as inputs in producing other products. These are broadly classified in to (i) Materials and Parts,  \n(ii) Capital Items, and (iii) Supplies and Business Services.\nPackaging: The act of designing and producing the container or wrapper \nof a product is referred as packaging. There can be three different levels of packaging viz., Primary package, Secondary packaged, Transport package. \nCh_10.indd   284 2/6/2024   11:28:52 AM\n2024-25"

Some \nof the important functions, include Product identification; Product protection; Facilitating the use of the product and Promotion of goods and services.\nLabelling: A simple looking but important task in the marketing of goods \nrelates to designing the label to be put on the package. The label may vary from a simple tag attached to the product to complex graphics that are part of the package. The most important functions of labels include i) describing the product ii) help in identifying the product or brand; iii) help in grading the products into different categories; and aids in promotion of the products.\nPricing: Price may be defined as the amount of money paid by a buyer or \nreceived by a seller in consideration of the purchase of a product or service. \nGenerally, if the price of a product is increased, its demand comes down, and vice-versa. Pricing is considered to be an effective competitive weapon. It is also the single most important factor affecting the revenue and profits of a firm.The factors affecting price determination are (i) Product Cost (ii) The Utility and Demand (iii) Competition (iv) Government and Legal regulations and (v) Marketing Methods Used.\nPhysical Distribution: There are two important decisions relating to this aspect- \none regarding physical movement of goods and two, regarding the channels. Physical Distribution covers all the activities required to physically move goods from manufacturers to the customers. The main component of physical distribution are (i) Order Processing; (ii) Transportation; (iii) Warehousing; and (iv). Inventory Control: Just-in-Time-Inventory.\nPromotion: Promotion refers to the use of communication with the twin \nobjective of informing potential customers about a product and persuading \nthem to buy it. There are four major tools, or elements of promotion mix, which are — (i) Advertising, (ii) Personal Selling, (iii) Sales Promotion, and (iv) Publicity. These tools are used in different combinations to achieve the goals of promotion.\nAdvertising is the most commonly used tool of promotion. It is an impersonal \nform of communication, which is paid for by the marketers (Sponsors) to \npromote some goods or service. The merits of advertising, as a medium of communication, include (i) Mass reach; (ii) Enhancing customer satisfaction and confidence; (iii) Expressiveness; and (iv) Economy.\nThe limitations of advertising are that it is (i) less forceful (ii) lacks Feedback (iii) \ninflexibility (iv) low effectiveness.

Advertising is therefore considered an essential function of marketing.\nPersonal selling involves oral presentation of message in the form of \nconversation with one or more prospective customers for the purpose of making sales. Personal Selling plays important role for the business persons as well as for the society.\nSales Promotion refers to short-term incentives, which are designed to \nencourage the buyers to make immediate purchase of a product service. These include promotional efforts other than advertising, personal selling and publicity, used by a company to boost its sales. Commonly used Sales Promotion Activities include rebate, Discount, refunds, Product Combinations, Quantity Gift, Instant Draws and Assigned Gift, Lucky Draw, Usable Benefit, Full Finance @ 0%, sampling, and contests.\nPublicity is similar to advertising, in the sense that it is a non-personal form \nof communication. However, as against advertising it is a non-paid form of communication. In publicity, as the information is disseminated by an independent source. However, an important limitation of publicity is that as a medium of promotion, it is not within the control of a marketing firm.\nPublic Relations: It is about managing organisations image in the eyes of all \nstake holders.

It is important for us to be an aware and informed consumer of goods and services available to us in the market.The above case is just one of the examples of the many problems that consumers face in the purchase, use and consumption of goods and services. But, very few consumers are aware of their rights given to them by the Consumer Protection Act 2019. The Consumer Protection Act 20192019 has replaced the Act 1986 and seeks to widen its scope in addressing consumer concerns.\nHave you ever thought what \nwould be the plight of consumers if adequate protection is not provided to them? With growing competition and in an attempt to increase their sales and market share, manufacturers, sellers and service-providers may be tempted to engage in unscrupulous, exploitative and unfair trade practices like defective and unsafe products, adulteration, false and misleading advertising, hoarding, black-marketing, etc. This means that a consumer might be exposed to risks due to unsafe products, might suffer from bad health due to adulterated food products, might be cheated because of misleading advertisements or sale of spurious products, might have to pay a higher price when sellers engage in overpricing, hoarding or black-marketing, etc. As a result, consumer becomes unsafe, feels cheated and is exposed to many risks \nand health problems. \nCan business afford to ignore the \ninterests of consumers? The market forces have changed from a seller market i.e., the earlier approach of caveat emptor which means Let the buyer beware, to a consumer market i.e., caveat venditor which implies \nLet the seller beware. A consumer is said to be a KING in the free market economy. Hence, consumer protection has significance for both consumers and business alike. Under the Consumer Protection Act 2019, the Government of India has conferred a legal protection to safeguard interests of a consumer. \nImportance  of consumer  protectIon\nThe concept of consumer protection is to safeguard the interests of the consumers. It adopts measures to protect consumers from unethical malpractices by businesses and provide a swift redressal of their grievances with regard to:\n1.\n Sale of adulterated goods such as adding inferior substances to the product being sold.\n2.\n Sale of counterfeit goods such as selling a product of lesser value than the real product.\n3.\n Sale of sub-standard goods such as the sale of products that do not meet the prescribed quality standards.\n4.\n Sale of duplicate goods.\nCh_11.indd   290 10-08-2022   10:03:34\n2024-25"

It not only includes educating consumers about their rights and responsibilities, but also helps in getting their grievances redressed. It not only requires a judicial machinery for protecting the interests of consumers but also requires the consumers to be united and form themselves into consumer associations for protection and promotion of their interests. \nFrom \nconsumers’ point of view\nThe im\nportance of consumer protection \nfrom the consumers’ point of view can \nbe understood from the following points:\n (i) Consumer Ignorance:  In the \nlight of widespread ignorance of consumers about their \nrights \nand reliefs available to them, it becomes necessary to educate them about the same so as to achieve consumer awareness.\n (ii\n) Unorganised Consumers:   \nConsumers need to be organised in t\nhe form of consumer \norganisations which would take care of their interests. Though, in India, we do have consumer organisations which are working in this direction, adequate protection is required to be given to consumers till these organisations become powerful enough to protect and promote the interests of consumers.\nCh_11.indd   291 10-08-2022   10:03:34\n2024-25"

Business organisations make money by selling goods and providing services to consumers. Thus, consumers form an important group among the many stake-holders of business and like other stakeholders, their interest has to be well taken care of.\n (iv) Moral Justificatio\nn: It is the \nmoral \nduty of any business to \ntake care of consumer’s interest and avoid any form of their exploitation. Thus, a business must avoid unscrupulous, exploitative and unfair trade practices like defective and unsafe products, adulteration, false and misleading advertising, hoarding, black marketing, etc.\n (v) Government Intervention:  A \nbusiness engaging in any form of exploitative trade practices would \ninvite government \nintervention or action.

In case the parties agree for settlement by mediation and give written consent, the district commission refers the matter for mediation and the provisions relating to mediation shall apply. However, in the event of failure of settlement by mediation proceeds with the complaint. If the complaint alleges defect in goods which cannot be determined without proper analysis or test of goods, the commission obtains the sample of goods, seal it and refer to the appropriate authority for analysis. \nIn case of services, the dispute is settled based on the basis of evidence brought to its notice \nby the complainant and can ask for any required information document or records from the service provider for settlement. \nIf any of the parties are \nnot satisfied by the order of District Commission can appeal against such order to the State Commission on the grounds of facts or law within a period of forty five days from the date of order. \n 2. State Commission:  It is \nestablished by the respective state government \nand ordinarily \nfunction at the state capital. State Commission has a jurisdiction to entertain complaints where value of goods and services paid as consideration exceeds one crore but does not exceed ten crore rupees.
