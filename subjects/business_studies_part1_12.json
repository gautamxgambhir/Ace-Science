His strong sense of values and spirit of innovation and entrepreneurship are a legacy that continues to guide Tata companies till date. He had four goals in life: setting up an iron and steel company, a world-class learning institution, a unique hotel and a hydro-electric plant. Only the hotel became a reality during his lifetime, with the inauguration of the Taj Mahal Hotel at Colaba waterfront in Mumbai on 3 December 1903 at the cost of 11 million (worth 11 billion in 2015 prices). At that time it was the only hotel in India to have electricity. \nHe believed that satisfied workers create satisfied workers and \nin lieu to this principle he paid all his workers gratuity, provident fund well before it was made mandatory. His management skills were clearly evident when minute details were chalked in planning and building the entire city of Jamshedpur. The values and principles that have governed the business for a century are enshrined in the Tata Code of Conduct (TCOC).\nFrom an early foray into steel and automobiles, to staying \nabreast of the latest technologies, the Tata Group today has 29 publicly-listed Tata enterprises, which include Tata Steel, Tata Motors, Tata Consultancy Services, Tata Power, Tata Chemicals, Tata Global Beverages, Tata T eleservices, Titan, Tata Communications and Indian Hotels. The group has a combined market capitalisation of around $103.51bn (2016-17).\nTata has a strong sense of social responsibility. They balance \neconomic prosperity, environmental responsibility and social benefits for the community. In India, they are a partner in progress with Odisha, and believe in taking its stakeholders forward in its journey of growth. Tata Steel Thailand is one of the first 30 companies that joined UNICEF in Child Friendly Business in “The Children Sustainability Forum” to make a commitment in protecting children’s rights.

It has risen to the top because of its quality of management. Management is required in all kinds of organisations\n — those \nmanufacturing handlooms, trading in consumer goods or providing hairstyling services and even in  \nnon-business organisations. Let us take another example. \nSmita Rai is a 38-year old\n \nentrepreneur who grew up in a rural district called Namchi, South Sikkim. She was very good in art and craft particularly, Wax moulds. She loved to make candles, often she make into toys and small pieces of art with wax and used it as a gift for her friends and relatuves. She was loved and appreciated for these. Smita was never happy with the conditions of the women in her district as most were poor and jobless, so she \nplanned to do something to solve their problems because she knew that imparting skills for livelihood is needed but she had no idea of how to implement her idea. \nIn August 2012, she met Abishek \nLama, the Branch Manager of NEDFI, Namchi Branch, a financial corporation which support local people with skills development programs and also channelize them into revenue generating activities. Smita got interested. “I love making candles, then, why not convert my hobby into a venture and involve these rural women also”, she thought. This led to the establishment of Namchi Designer Candles with the help of NEDFI, some financial institutions and support from different stakeholders in various dimensions. \nSince then, the women have never \nlooked back, despite challenges.

During Diwali, they produce customized candles meant for the occasion. These Diwali themed candle has been a success in Sikkim as its demand increases on a yearly basis. \nNamchi Designer Candles has been \nreceiving numerous awards such as North East Women Entrepreneur of the year 2015-2016 for Sikkim and Sreemanta Shankar Mission of Guwahati on 26th April 2018 at  \nNew Delhi.\nA typical day in Smita’s life \nconsists of a series of interrelated and continuous functions. She has to plan a special festive collection for Diwali. This means organising more funds and recruiting more workers. She also has to regularly communicate with her suppliers to ensure that deadlines regarding delivery of goods are met. In the course of the day, she meets customers for a general feedback and any suggestions that they  \nmay have. \nSmita is managing Namchi Designer \nCandles.

Schools, hospitals, shops and large corporations are all organisations with diverse goals that are aimed at achieving something. No matter what the organisation is or what its goals might be, they all have something in common\n-management \nand managers.\nYou have observed \nthat Smita’s \nwork as a manager consists of a series of different activities or functions aimed at achieving the goals of the organisation. These interconnected and interdependent functions are part of management. Successful organisations do not achieve their goals by chance but  \nby following a deliberate process called ‘management’.\n“Management is the process of designing and maintaining an environment in which \nindividuals, working together in groups, efficiently accomplish selected aims.”\n Harold Koontz and Heinz Weihrich\n“Management is defined as t he process of planning, organising, actuating and controlling \nan organisation’s operations in order to achieve coordination of the human and material resources essential in the effective and efficient attainment of objectives.” \nRobert L. T rewelly and M. Gene Newport\n“Management is the process of working with and through others to effectively achieve \norganisational objectives by efficiently using limited resources in the changing environment.”\nKreitnerDefinitions of Management\nCh_01.indd   3 24-09-2019   12:15:10 PM\nReprint 2024-25"

                "text": "4\nBusiness Studies\nManagement is essential for all \norganisations big or small, profit or \nnon-profit, services or manufacturing. Management is necessary so that individuals make their best contri-bution towards group objectives. \nManagement consists of a series \nof interrelated functions that are performed by all managers. Later in this chapter you will understand that although both of them are managers, they function at different levels in the organisation. The time spent by managers in different functions however is different. Managers at the top level spend more time in planning and organising than managers at lower levels of the organisation. \nconcept\nManagement is a very popular term and has been used extensively for all types of activities and mainly for taking charge of different activities in any enterprise. As you have seen from the above example and case study that management is an activity which is necessary wherever there is a group of people working in an organisation. People in organisations are performing diverse tasks but they are all working towards the same goal. Management aims at guiding their efforts towards achieving a common objective — a goal. Thus, management has to see that tasks are completed and goals are achieved (i.e., effectiveness) with the least amount of resources at a minimum cost (i.e., efficiency).Management, has therefore, been \ndefined as a process of getting things \ndone with the aim of achieving goals effectively and efficiently. We need to analyse this definition. There are certain terms which require elaboration. These are (a) process, (b) effectively, and (c) efficiently.\nProcess in the definition means the \nprimary functions or activities that management performs to get things done. These functions are planning, organising, staffing, directing and controlling which we will discuss later  \nin the chapter and the book.\nBeing effective or doing work \neffectively basically means finishing the given task. Effectiveness in management is concerned with doing the right task, completing activities and achieving goals. In other words, it is concerned with the end result.\nBut it is not enough to just \ncomplete the tasks. There is another aspect also, i.e., being efficient or as we say doing work efficiently.\nEfficiency means doing the task \ncorrectly and with minimum cost. There is a kind of cost-benefit  \nanalysis involved and the relationship between inputs and outputs. If by using less resources (i.e., the inputs) more benefits are derived (i.e., the outputs) then efficiency has increased. Efficiency is also increased when for the same benefit or outputs, fewer resources are used and less costs are incurred. Input resources are money, materials, equipment and \nCh_01.indd   4 24-09-2019   12:15:10 PM\nReprint 2024-25"

Obviously, management is concerned with the efficient use of these resources, because they  \nreduce costs and ultimately lead to higher profits.\nEffectiveness versus \nEfficiency\nThese two terms are different but they \nare interrelated. For management, it is important to be both effective and efficient. Effectiveness and efficiency are two sides of the same coin. But these two aspects need to be balanced and management at times, has to compromise with efficiency. For example, it is easier to be effective and ignore efficiency  \ni.e., complete the given task but at a high cost. Suppose, a company’s target production is 5000 units in a year. To achieve this target the manager has to operate on double shifts due to power failure most of the time. The manager is able to produce 5000 units but at a higher production cost. In this case, the manager was effective but not so efficient, since for the same output, more inputs (labour cost, electricity costs) were used.\nAt times, a business may con-\ncentrate more on producing goods with fewer resources i.e., cutting down cost but not achieving the target production. Consequently, the goods do not reach the market and hence the demand for them declines and competitors enter the market. This is a case of being efficient but \nnot effective since the goods did not reach the market.\nTherefore, it is important for \nmanagement to achieve goals (effectiveness) with minimum resources i.e., as efficiently as possible while maintaining a balance between effectiveness and efficiency. Usually high efficiency is associated with  \nhigh effectiveness which is the aim of  \nall managers. But undue emphasis  \non high efficiency without being effective is also not desirable. Poor  \nmanagement is due to both ineffi-ciency and ineffectiveness. \ncharacterIstIcs  of \nManageMent\nAfter going through some of the definitions we find some elements that may be called the basic characteristics of management:\n (i) Management is a goal-oriented process: An organisation has a  \nset of basic goals which are the basic \nreason for its existence. \nThese should be simple and  \nclearly stated. Different organ -\nisations have different goals. For example, the goal of a retail stor\ne \nmay be to increase sales, but the goal of The Spastics Society of India is to impart education to  \nchildren with special needs. Management unites the efforts of different individuals in the organisation towards achieving these goals.\nCh_01.indd   5 24-09-2019   12:15:10 PM\nReprint 2024-25"

In 2000 when he stepped down the firm’s turnover had increased multifold to $500 billion. What was the secret of Welch’s success? He has laid down the following pointers for managers to be successful: \nn Create a vision and then ignite your organisation to make this vision a reality.  \nGet people so passionate about what they are doing that they cannot wait to execute this plan. Have great energy, competitive spirit and the ability to spark excitement and achieve results. Search for leaders who have the same qualities.\nn Focus on strategic issues. Your job is to understand the vital issues within each of your businesses. Recognise the talent needed to win in those markets. \nn Focus on the main issue . Your job is to see the big picture. Don’t manage every detail. Don’t get \ncaught up in the minute details, but instead inspire others to execute some \nof your vision. Surround yourself with great people and trust them to do their job and contribute their best to the organisation.\nn Involve everyone and welcome great ideas from everywhere.  Anyone can be a \nleader, just so long as they contribute, and the most meaningful way for anyone to contribute is to come up with a good idea. Business is all about getting the best ideas from everyone. New ideas are the lifeblood of the organisation, the fuel that makes it run. “The hero is the person with a new idea.” There is simply nothing more important to an organisation than expressing ideas and creating a vision.\nn Lead by example. T o spark others to perform, you must lead by example. Jack Welch’s mastery of the four E’s of leadership \n– Energy, Energise, Edge, and Execution – was \nalways in evidence. “He had great energy, sparked others, had incredible competitive spirit, and had a record of execution that was second to none. This is a key of the Welch phenomenon. Had he been lacking in any of the traits he espoused, he would \nnot have commanded such acclaim.”\n (ii) Management is all pervasive: The activities involved in managing an enterprise \nare common to all \norganisations whether economic, social or political. A petrol pump needs to be managed as much as a hospital or a school. What managers do in India, the USA, Germany or Japan is the same. How they do it may be quite different. This difference is due to the differences in culture, tradition and history. (iii) Management is multidimen-sional: Management is a complex activity \nthat has three \nmain dimensions. These are:\n(a) Management of work: All organisations exist for the\n \nperformance of some work. In a factory, a product is manufactured, in a garment store a customer’s need is satisfied and in a hospital a patient is treated. Management translates this work in terms The Management Mantra from GE\nSource: www.ge.co.in\nCh_01.indd   6 24-09-2019   12:15:10 PM\nReprint 2024-25"

This is done in terms of problems to be solved, decisions to be made, plans to be established, budgets to be prepared, responsibilities to be assigned and authority to be delegated.\n(b)\n Management of people : Human \nresources or people are an organisation’s greatest asset. Despite all developments in  \ntechnology “getting work done  \nthrough people” is still a major  \ntask for the manager. Managing people has two dimensions (i) it implies dealing with employees as individuals with  \ndiverse needs and behavior; (ii) it also means dealing with individuals as a group of people. The task of management is to make people work towards achieving the organisation’s goals, by making their strengths effective and their weaknesses irrelevant.\n(c)\n Management of operations: No matter what the or\nganisation, \nit has some basic product or service to provide in order to  \nsurvive.

Every member of the group has a different purpose for joining the organisation but as members of the organisation they work towards fulfilling the common organisational goal.

An organisation interacts with its external envi-ronment which consists of various social, economic and political factors. In order to be successful, an organisation must  \nchange itself and its goals according to the needs of the environment.

They must be derived from the basic purpose of the business. In any organisation there are different \nobjectives and management has to achieve all objectives in an effective and efficient manner. Objectives can be classified into organisational objectives, social objectives and personal or individual objectives.\n (i) Organisational Objectives:  \nManagement is responsible for setting and achieving objectives for the or\nganisation. It has to \nachieve a variety of objectives in all areas considering the interest of all stakeholders including, shareholders, employees, cust\n-\nomers and the government. The m\nain objective of any organisation \nshould be to utilise human and material resources to the maximum possible advantage, i.e., to fulfill the economic objectives of a business. These are survival, profit and growth. \n  Survival: The basic objectives of any business is survival. Management must strive to\n \nensure the survival of the organisation. In order to survive, an organisation must earn enough revenues to cover costs.\n  Pro\nfit: Mere survival is not enough \nfor business. Management has to ensure that the organisation makes a profit. Profit provides a vital incentive for the continued successful operation of the enterprise. Profit is essential for covering costs and risks of the business.\nCh_01.indd   9 24-09-2019   12:15:16 PM\nReprint 2024-25"

To remain in the industry, management must exploit fully the growth potential of the organisation. Growth of a business can be measured in terms of sales volume increase in the number of employees, \nA quiet digital revolution is reshaping the lives of farmers in remote Indian villages.In these villages, farmers grow soyabeans, wheat and coffee in small plots of land, as they have done for thousands of years. A typical village has no reliable electricity and has antiquated telephone lines. The farmers are largely illiterate and have never seen a computer. But farmers in these villages are conducting e-business through an initiative called E-Choupal, created by ITC, one of India’s largest consumer product and agribusiness companies.\nITC’s E-Chaupal initiative is a fine example of a business organisation fulfilling \ncorporate social responsibility. The basic aim of the programme is to provide farmers in rural India with the opportunity to make use of a direct marketing channel eliminating multiple intermediation and wasteful handling and unnecessary transaction costs. It is the single-largest information technology-based intervention by a corporate entity in rural India, transforming the Indian farmer into a progressive knowledge-seeking citizen, enriching him with knowledge and elevating him to a new order of empowerment.\nE-Choupal delivers real-time information and customised knowledge to improve \nthe farmer’s decision-making ability, thereby better aligning farm output to market demands; securing better quality, productivity and improved price discovery. Given the low levels of literacy in the rural sector, the role of the Choupal Sanchalak, the lead farmer of the village, in facilitating physical interface between the computer terminal and the farmers is central to the project. E-Choupal Smart Cards enable farmer identification to provide customised information on the E-Choupal website. Online transactions are captured to reward farmers for volume and value of usage.\nThe E-Chaupal initiative has found its way into the Harvard Business School as a \nleading case study illustarating the use of modern technology by a leading business house for the benefit of the rural poor.\nSource: Mohanbir Sawhney, McCormick Tribune Professor of T echnology, Kellogg School of Management, USA.the number of products or the increase in capital investment, etc. There can be other indicators of growth. \n (ii) Social objectives: It involves the creation \nof benefit for \nsociety.

This includes using environmental friendly methods of production, giving employment opportunities to the underpreviledged sections of society and providing basic amenities like schools and healthcare, etc., for community. The box given below illustrates how a company can fulfill its social responsibility.\n (iii) Personnel objectives: Organi-sations are \nmade up of people \nwho have different personalities, backgrounds, experiences and objectives. They all become part of the organisation to satisfy their diverse needs. These vary from financial needs such as competitive salaries and perks, social needs such as peer recognition and higher level needs such as personal growth and development. Management has to reconcile personal goals with organisational objectives for harmony in the organisation.\nImportance  of management\nHaving understood that management is a universal activity that is integral to any organisation we now examine some of the reasons that have made management so important:\n (i) Management helps in achieving group goals: Management is requir\ned not for itself but for achieving the goals of the organisation. The task of a manager is to give a common direction to the individual effort in achieving the overall goal of the organisation.\n (ii) Management increases effici­ency: The aim of a manager is to reduce costs and increase productivity \nthrough better \nplanning, organising, directing, staffing and controlling the activities of the organisation.\n (iii) Management creates a dynamic organisation: All organisations have to function in an envir\nonment \nwhich is constantly changing. It is generally seen that individuals in an organisation resist change as it often means moving from a familiar, secure environment into a newer and more challenging one. Management helps people adapt to these changes so that the organisation is able to maintain its competitive edge. \n (iv) Management helps in achieving personal objectives: A manager motivates and leads his team \nin \nsuch a manner that individual members are able to achieve personal goals while contributing to the overall organisational objective. Through motivation and leadership the management helps individuals to develop team spirit, cooperation and commitment to group success. \n (v) Management helps in the development of society: An orga-\nCh_01.indd   11 19-11-2019   5:06:37 PM\nReprint 2024-25"

Although modern organisations are  \nof recent origin, organised activity has existed since the time of the ancient civilisations. In fact, organisations may be considered the distinguishing feature that separated civilised society from uncivilised ones. The earliest management practices were a set of rules and regulations that grew out of the experiences of governmental and commercial activities. The development of trade and commerce gradually led to the development of  \nmanagement principles and practices. \nThe term ‘management’ today has \nseveral different connotations that highlight the different aspects of its nature. The study of management has evolved over a period of time along with the modern organisations; based both on the experience and practice of managers and a set of theoretical relationships. Over a period of time, \nit has grown into a dynamic subject with its own special characteristics. However, one question that needs to be addressed pertaining to the nature of management is whether it is a science or an art or both?  \nIn order to answer this let us  \nexamine the features of both science and art to see how far management fulfills them.\nManageMent  as an art\nWhat is art? Art is the skillful and personal application of existing knowledge to achieve desired results. It can be acquired through study, observation and experience. Since art is concerned with personal application of knowledge some kind of ingenuity and creativity is required to practice the basic principles learnt. The basic features of an art are  \nas follows:\n (i) Existence of theoretical knowledge: Art \npresupposes the \nexistence of certain theoretical knowledge. Experts in their respective areas have derived certain basic principles which are applicable to a particular form of art. For example, literature on dancing, public speaking, acting or music is widely recognised. \n (ii) Personalised application: The use of this basic knowledge v\naries \nfrom individual to individual. Art, therefore, is a very person\n-\nCh_01.indd   12 24-09-2019   12:15:16 PM\nReprint 2024-25"

For example, two \ndancers, two speakers, two actors,  \nor two writers will always differ in demonstrating their art.\n (iii) Based on practice and creativity: All art is practical. Art involves the creative practice of existing theor\netical knowledge. \nWe know that all music is based on seven basic notes. However, what makes the composition of a musician unique or different is his use of these notes in a creative manner that is entirely his own interpretation.\nManagement can be said to be \nan art since it satisfies the following criteria:\n (i) A successful manager practices\n \nthe art of management in the day-to-day job of managing an enterprise based on study, observation and experience. There is a lot of literature available in various areas of management like marketing, finance and human resources which the manager has to specialise in. There is existence of theoretical knowledge.\n (ii) There are various theories of management, as pr\nopounded \nby many management thinkers, which prescribe certain universal principles. A manager applies these scientific methods and body of knowledge to a given situation, an issue or a problem, in his own unique manner. A good manager works through a combination of practice, creativity, imagination, initiative and innovation. A manager achieves perfection after long practice. Students of management also apply these principles differently depending on how creative they are.\n (iii) A manager applies this acquired\n \nknowledge in a personalised  \nand skillful manner in the light  \nof the realities of a given situation. He is involved in the activities of the organisation, studies critical situations and formulates his own theories for use in a given situation. This gives rise to different styles of management\nThe best managers are committed \nand dedicated individuals; highly trained and educated, with personal qualities such as ambition, self- motivation, creativity and imagination, a desire for development of the self and the organisation they belong to. All management practices are based on the same set of principles; what distinguishes a successful manager from a less successful one is the ability to put these principles into practice. \nManageMent  as a scIence\nScience is a systematised body of knowledge that explains certain general truths or the operation of general laws.

Anthropologists’ work on cultures and environments, for instance, has helped managers to better understand differences in fundamental values, attitudes, and behavior between people in different countries and within different organisations.Economics  – Economics is concerned with the allocation and distribution of \nscarce resources. It provides us with an understanding of the changing economy as well as the role of competition and free markets in a global context. An understanding of free trade and protectionist policies is absolutely essential to any manager operating in the global marketplace, and these topics are addressed by economists.Philosophy – Philosophy courses inquire into the nature of things, particularly values and ethics. Ethics are standards that govern human conduct. These ethics have shaped today’s organisations by providing a basis for legitimate authority, linking rewards to performance, and justifying the existence of business and the corporate form.Political Science – Political science is the study of the behavior of individuals and groups within a political environment. Management is affected by a nation’s form of government – by whether it allows its citizens to hold property, by its citizens’ ability to engage in and enforce contracts, and by the appeal mechanisms available to redress grievances. A nation’s stand on property, contracts, and justice, in turn, shapes the type, form, and policies of its organisations.Psychology – Psychology is the science that seeks to measure, explain, and sometimes change the behaviour of humans and other animals. T oday’s managers confront both a diverse customer base and a diverse set of employees. Psychologists’ efforts to understand gender and cultural diversity provide managers with a better perception of the needs of their changing customer and employee populations. Psychology courses are also relevant to managers in terms of gaining a better understanding of motivation, leadership, trust, employee selection, performance appraisals, and training techniques.Sociology – Sociology is the study of people in relation to their fellow human beings. What are some of the sociological issues that have relevance to managers? Here are a few. How are societal changes such as globalisation, increasing cultural diversity, changing gender roles, and varying forms of family life affecting organisational practices? What are the implications of schooling practices and education trends on future employees’ skills and abilities? Answers to questions such as these have a major effect on how managers operate their businesses.\nSource: Fundamentals of ManagementStephen P . RobbinsDavid A.

Its principles are \nbased on a cause and effect relationship. For example, the phenomenon of an apple falling from a tree towards the ground is explained by the law of gravity.\n (ii) Principles based on experimen-tation:\n Scientific principles are  \nfirst developed through observation and then tested through repeated experimentation under controlled conditions. \n (iii) Universal validity: Scientific principles have universal validity and application. \nBased on the \nabove features, we \ncan say that management has some characteristics of science. \n (i) Management has a systematised body of knowledge. It has its own theory and principles that have developed over a period  \nof time, but it also \ndraws on  \nother disciplines such as Economics, Sociology, Psychology and Mathematics. Like all other organised activity, management has its own vocabulary of terms and concepts. For example, all of us discuss sports like cricket and soccer using a common vocabulary. The players also use these terms to communicate with each other. Similarly managers need to communicate with one another with the help of a common vocabulary for a better understanding of their work situation.\n (ii) The principles of management have evolved over a period of time based on repeated\n \nexperimentation and observation in different types of organisations. However, since management deals with human beings and human behaviour, the outcomes of these experiments are not capable of being accurately predicted or replicated. Therefore, management can be called an inexact science. Despite these limitations, management scholars have been able to identify general principles of management. For example, scientific management principles by F.W. Taylor and Functional Management principles by Henri Fayol which you will study in the next chapter.\n (iii\n) Since the principles of mana-gement are not as exact as the principles of science, their application and use is not universal.\n \nThey have to be modified according to a given situation.

These principles constitute the science of management. Management as an art and a science are therefore not mutually exclusive, but complement each other. \nManage Ment as a profess Ion\nYou have understood so far that all forms of organised activity need to be managed. You would also have observed that organisations look for individuals with specific qualifications and experience to manage them. It has also been observed that there has been an increase in the corporate form of business on the one hand and increasing emphasis on managed business concerns. Does this imply that management is a profession? To answer this question let us examine the salient features of a profession and see whether management satisfies them. \nA profession has the following \ncharacteristics:\n (i) Well-defined body of know-ledge: All professions are based\n \non a well-defined body of knowledge that can be acquired through instruction.\n (ii) Restricted entry: The entry to a profession is \nrestricted through \nan examination or through acquiring an educational degree. For example, to become a chartered accountant in India a candidate has to clear a specified examination conducted by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India.\n (iii) Professional association: All \nprofessions ar\ne affiliated to a \nprofessional association which regulates entry, grants certificate of practice and formulates and enforces a code of conduct. To be able to practice in India lawyers have to become members of the Bar Council which regulates and controls their activities.\n (iv) Ethical code of conduct:\n All \nprofessions are bound by a code of conduct which guides the behaviour of its members. All doctors, for example, take the oath of ethical practice at the time they enter the profession. \n (v) Service motive: The basic motive of a profession is to serve their client’s inter\nests \nby rendering dedicated and committed service. The task of a lawyer is to ensure that his client gets justice.\nManagement does not meet \nthe exact criteria of a profession. However, it does have some of the features of a profession:\n (i) All over the world \nthere is \nmarked growth in management as a discipline. It is based on a systematic body of knowledge \ncomprising well-defined \nCh_01.indd   16 24-09-2019   12:15:17 PM\nReprint 2024-25"

This knowledge can be acquired  \nat different colleges and professional institutes and through a number of books and journals. The subject of management is taught at different institutions. Some of these have been set up with the specific purpose of providing management education such as the Indian Institutes of Management (IIMs) in India.  Entry to different institutes is usually through an examination.\n (ii) There is no restriction on anyone being designated or appointed\n \nas manager in any business enterprise. Anyone can be called a manager irrespective of the educational qualifications possessed. \n  Unlike professions such as \nmedicine or law which require a practicing doctor or lawyer to possess valid degr\nees, nowhere \nin the world is it mandatory  \nfor a manager to possess any  \nsuch specific degree. But professional knowledge and training is considered to be a desirable qualification, since  \nthere is greater demand for those who possess degrees or diplomas from reputed institutions. Therefore, as such the second criterion has not been strictly met.\n (iii) There are several associations of \npractising managers in India, like the AIMA (All India Management Association) that \nhas laid down a code \nof conduct to regulate the activities \nof their members. There is, however,  \nno compulsion for managers to be members of such an association nor does it have any statutory backing. \n (iv) The basic purpose of manage-\nment is to help the organisation achieve its stated goal. This may be profit maximisation for a business enterprise and service for a hospital. However, pr\nofit \nmaximisation as the objective of management does not hold true and is fast changing. Therefore, if an organisation has a good management team that is efficient and effective it automatically serves society by providing good quality products at reasonable prices.\nLeveLs of ManageMent\nManagement is a universal term \nused for certain functions performed by individuals in an enterprise who are bound together in a hierarchy of relationships. Every individual in the hierarchy is responsible for successful completion of a particular task. To be able to fulfill that responsibility he is assigned a certain amount of authority or the right to take a decision. This authority-responsibility relationship binds individuals as superiors and subordinates and gives rise to different levels in an organisation. Generally speaking there are three levels in the hierarchy of an organisation.\nCh_01.indd   17 24-09-2019   12:15:17 PM\nReprint 2024-25"

Planning cannot prevent problems, but it can predict them and prepare contingency plans to deal with them if and when they occur.\nOrganising is the management \nfunction of assigning duties, grouping tasks, establishing authority and allocating resources required to carry out a specific plan. Once a specific plan has been established for the accomplishment of an organisational goal, the organising function examines the \nactivities and resources required to implement the plan. It determines what activities and resources are required. It decides who will do a particular task, where it will be done, and when it will be done. Organising involves the grouping of the required tasks into manageable departments or work units and the establishment of authority and reporting relationships within the organisational hierarchy. Proper organisational techniques help in the accomplishment of work and promote both the efficiency of operations and the effectiveness of results. Different kinds of business require different structures according to the nature of work. You will read more about this in a  \nlater chapter.Staffing simply stated, is finding the right people for the right job. A very important aspect of management is \nto make sure that the right people with the right qualifications are available at the right places and times to accomplish the goals of the organisation.

Here management must determine what activities and outputs are critical to success, how and where they can be measured and who should have the authority to take corrective action.\nThe various functions of a \nmanager are usually discussed in the order given above, suggesting that a manager first plans, then organises, puts staff in position, then directs, and finally controls. In reality, managers are rarely able to carry out these functions in isolation. The activities of a manager are interrelated and it is often difficult to pinpoint where one ended and the other began.\ncoordInatIon  — t he \nessence  of ManageMent\nYou have understood by now that \na manager has to perform five interrelated functions in the process of managing an organisation which is a system made up of different interlinked and interdependent subsystems. A manager has to link these diverse groups towards the achievement of a common goal. The process by which a manager synchronises the activities of different departments is known as coordination.\nCoordination is the force that \nbinds all the other functions of management. It is the common thread that runs through all activities such as purchase, production, sales, and finance to ensure continuity  \nin the working of the organisation.    \nCoordination is sometimes considered a separate function of management. It is however, the essence of management, for achieving harmony among individual efforts towards the accomplishment of group goals. Each managerial function is an exercise contributing individually to coordination. Coordination is implicit and inherent in all functions of an organisation.\nThe process of coordinating the \nactivities of an organisation begins at the planning stage itself. Top management plans for the entire organisation. According to these plans the organisational structure is developed and staffed. In order to ensure that these plans are executed according to plans directing is required. Any discrepancies between actual and realised activities are then taken care of at the stage of controlling. It is through the process of coordination that a manager ensures the orderly arrangement of individual and group efforts to ensure unity of action in the realisation of common objectives. Coordination therefore involves synchronisation of the different actions or efforts of the various units of an organisation. This provides the requisite amount, quality, timing and sequence of efforts which ensures that planned objectives are achieved with a minimum of conflict.\nCh_01.indd   21 24-09-2019   12:15:19 PM\nReprint 2024-25"

It gives a common focus to group effort to ensure that performance is as it was planned and scheduled.\n (ii) Coordination ensures unity of action: The purpose of coordination is to secur\ne unity \nof action in the realisation of a common purpose. It acts as the binding force between departments and ensures that all action is aimed at achieving the goals of the organisation.  \nAt Namchi Designer Candles,  \nthe production and sales department have to coordinate their work, so that production takes place according to the demand in the market.\n (iii) Coordination is a continuous process: Coordination is not a one-time function but a continuous process. It begins at the planning stage and continues till contr\nolling. Smita plans her \ndewali collection in the month of June itself. She has to then ensure that there is adequate workforce and continuously monitor whether production is proceeding according to plans. Her marketing department also has to be briefed in time to prepare their promotional and advertising campaigns.\n (iv) Coordination is an all pervasive function: Coordination \nis required \nat all levels of management due to the interdependent nature of activities of various departments. It integrates the efforts of different departments and different levels. The purchase, production and sales departmental efforts have to be coordinated by Smita for achieving organisational objectives harmoniously. The purchase department is responsible for procuring fabric. This then becomes the basis of the activities of the production department \nIn the absence of coordination what results is chaos\nCh_01.indd   22 24-09-2019   12:15:21 PM\nReprint 2024-25"

If \nfabric purchased is of an inferior quality or is not according to the specifications of the production department, further sales will also decline. In the absence of coordination there is overlapping and chaos instead of harmony and integration of activities.\n (v) Coordination is the responsibi-lity  of  all managers: Coordi-na\ntion is the function of every \nmanager in the organisation. Top level managers need to coordinate with their subordinates to ensure that the overall policies for the organisation are duly carried out. Middle level management coordinates with both the top level and first line managers. Operational level management coordinates the activities of its workers to ensure that work proceeds according to plans.\n (vi) Coordination is a deliberate function: A manager has to coordinate the efforts of different people in a conscious and deliberate manner. Even where members of a department willingly cooperate and work, coordination gives a direction to that willing spirit. Cooperation in the absence of coordination may lead to wasted effort and \ncoordination \nwithout cooperation may lead to dissatisfaction among employees.\nCoordination, therefore, is not a \nseparate function of management, but its very essence. For an organisation to effectively and efficiently achieve its objectives coordination is required. Like a thread in a garland, coordination is a part of all management functions. \nIMportance  of coord InatIon\nCoordination is important as it integrates the efforts of individuals, departments and specialists. The primary reason for coordination is that departments and individuals in the organisation are interdependent, \nCoordination is balancing and keeping together the team by ensuring suitable allocation of \ntasks to the various members and seeing that the tasks are performed with harmony among the members themselves. \n E.F .L.

Thus, managers need to reconcile differences in approach, timing, effort or interest. At the same time, there is a need to harmonise individual goals and organisational goals.\n(i) Growth in size: As organisations \ngrow in size, the number of people employed by the organisation also increases. At times, it may become difficult to integrate their efforts and activities. All individuals differ in their habits of work, background, approaches to situations and relationships with others. It becomes necessary to ensure that all individuals work towards the common goals of the organisation. But employees may have their own individual goals also. Therefore, for organisational efficiency, it is important to harmonise individual goals and organisational goals through coordination.\n(ii) Functional differentiation: \nFunctions of an organisation are divided into departments, divisions \nThe Dabbawallas of Mumbai is the story of a SIX SIGMA business enterprise. The success of the business lies in the complex yet well coordinated exercise that is carried out on the streets of Mumbai day after day.

After they step out of their \ndoor, someone begins the time-consuming process of preparing the worker a fresh, home-cooked lunch. What happens next for demonstrates the coordination of the dabbawallas system. The first dabbawalla picks up the tiffin from home and takes it to the nearest railway station.The second dabbawalla sorts out the dabbas at the railway station according to destination and puts them in the luggage carriage. The third one travels with the dabbas to the railway stations nearest to the destinations. The fourth one picks up dabbas from the railway station and drops them off at the offices.\nBy mid-morning, thousands of dabbawallas are bicycling through the streets of Mumbai, \nensuring a hot home cooked lunch for their customers. The whole tiffin distribution requires negligible technology. The dabbawallas rely on low capital and use cycles, wooden carriages and local trains to achieve their target.There are several groups that work independently and network with each other to achieve their goal.\nEach area is divided into several small distribution sectors and each sector is handled by \na particular person. This person understands the address in that locality very well. Also, this perfection comes with practice. Many new employees work for months under the guidance of their seniors. \nPunctuality and time management are on top of the agenda for dabbawallas. Whatever be \nthe circumstances, the dabbawallas never get delayed even by a few minutes.‘DABBAWALLAS’ – Excellence through Coordination\nCh_01.indd   24 24-09-2019   12:15:21 PM\nReprint 2024-25"

All these departments may have their own objectives, policies and their own style of working. For example, the marketing department’s objective may be to increase sales by 10 per cent by offering discounts. But, the finance department may not approve of such discounts as it means loss of revenue. These kinds of conflict arise in organisations because each unit/department is performing activities in isolation from others and barriers between departments are becoming more rigid.However, all departments and \nindividuals are interdependent and they have to depend on each other for information to perform their activities. The activity of each department needs to be focused on attainment of common organisational goals. The process of linking the activities of various departments is accomplished  \nby coordination.\n(iii) Specialisation: Modern \norganisations are characterised by a high degree of specialisation. Specialisation arises out of the complexities of modern technology and the diversity of tasks to be performed.

As boundaries between cultures and nations get blurred and new communication technology makes it possible to think of the world as a ‘global village’, the scope of international and intercultural relationships is rapidly expanding. The modern organisation is a global organisation that has to be managed in a global perspective. What does this imply?\nA global manager today is one who possesses what can be termed as ‘hard’ types of skills \nas well as ‘softer’ types of skills. Managers who understand analysis, strategy, engineering, \nand technology are still going to be needed, but extremely critical to global success are  people who understand how teams work, how organisations work, how people are motivated.\nA manager who really understands different cultures should be able to work in a West \nEuropean, non-English speaking country, then move to a developing country like Malaysia or Kenya, and then be transferred to an office based in New York, USA, and be almost immediately productive in all three places. \nIt can thus be understood that the role of a global manager has evolved in much the same \nway that the global industry and economy have evolved. It has changed from being a single dimensional role in a defined business context, to being a multi-faceted role that calls for a diverse combination of technical skills, soft management and people skills, and the ability to imbibe and learn different cultural experiences.Management in the T wenty-first Century\nCh_01.indd   25 24-09-2019   12:15:21 PM\nReprint 2024-25"

In fact, there is a long history of management thought. Management principles have evolved and are in the continuous process of evolution. (see box.)\nYou can see that the evolution of \nmanagement thought has been very fascinating. In this chapter we will study the contributions of Fredrick Winslow Taylor and Henri Fayol who as you have read are associated with the classical management theory. Both of them contributed immensely towards the study of management as a discipline. Whereas F.W. Taylor was an American mechanical engineer, Henri Fayol was a French mining engineer. Taylor gave the concept \nIn tracing the history of management, one comes across various schools of thought that have outlined principles to guide management practices. These schools of thought may be divided into 6 distinctive phases: 1 . Early Perspectives; 2. Classical Management Theory; 3. Neo Classical Theory — Human Relations Approach;  4. Behavioural Science Approach — Organisational Humanism; 5. Management Science/Operational Research; 6. Modern Management.\nEARLY PERSPECTIVES\n The first known management ideas \nwere recorded in 3000-4000 B.C. One \nPyramid built by Egyptian ruler Cheops required work to be done by 100,000 men for over twenty years in 2900 B.C. It covered 13 acres of land and measured 481 meters in height. The stone slabs had to be moved thousands of kilometres of distance. As folklore goes, even the sound of a hammer was not heard in the villages in the vicinity of the site of these pyramids. Such monumental work could not be completed without adherence to principles of sound management.\nCLASSICAL MANAGEMENT THEORY\n Rational economic view, scientific management, administrative principles, and bureaucratic organisation characterise \nthis phase. While the rational economic \nview assumed that people are motivated by economic gains primarily; scientific management of F .W. Taylor and others emphasised one best way of production etc; administrative theorists personified by Henri Fayol etc looked at the best way to combine jobs and people into an efficient organisation; bureaucratic organisation theorists led by Max Weber looked at ways to eliminate managerial inconsistencies due to abuse of power which contributed to ineffectiveness. This was the era of the industrial revolution and factory system of production. Large scale production would not have been possible without adherence to the principles governing organising production based on division of labour and specialisation, relationship between man and the machine, managing people and so on.Evolution of Management Principles\nCh_02.indd   31 24-09-2019   12:05:00 PM\nReprint 2024-25"

For example while deciding about promotion of an employee one manager may consider seniority, whereas the other may follow the principle of merit.\nOne may distinguish principles \nof management from those of pure science. Management principles are not as rigid as principles of pure science. They deal with human behaviour and, thus, are to be applied creatively given the demands of the situation. Human behaviour is never static and so also technology, which affects business. Hence all the principles have to keep pace with these changes. For example, in the absence of Information and NEO CLASSICAL THEORY — HUMAN RELATIONS APPROACH\n This school of thought developed between \n1920s to 1950s felt that employees \nsimply do not respond rationally to rules, chains of authority and economic incentives alone but are also guided by social needs, drives and attitudes. Hawthorne Studies at GEC etc., were conducted then. It was quite natural that in the early phases of the industrial revolution, the emphasis was on development of techniques and technology. The attention to the human factor was the salient aspect of this school of thought. This attention was to serve as a precursor to the development of behavioural sciences. \nBEHAVIOURAL SCIENCE APPROACH — ORGANISATIONAL HUMANISM \n Organisational behaviourists like Chris Argyris; Douglas McGregor, Abraham Maslow and Fredrick Herzberg used the knowledge of \npsychology, sociology \nand anthropology to develop this approach. The underlying philosophy of organisational humanism is that individuals need to use all of their capacities and creative skills at work as well as at home. \nMANAGEMENT SCIENCE/OPERATIONAL RESEARCH\n It emphasises research on operations and use of quantitativ\ne techniques to aid \nmanagers to take decisions.\nMODERN MANAGEMENT \n It sees modern organisations as complex systems and underlies contingency approach and use of modern techniques to solve organisational and human problems.\nSource: Adapted from Internet modern history source book on www.fordham.edu\nCh_02.indd   32 24-09-2019   12:05:00 PM\nReprint 2024-25"

The advent of ICT has expanded the capability of the managers to preside over large business empires spread across the globe. Infosys headquarters in Bangalore boast of the Asia’s largest flat screen in their conference room from where their managers can interact with their employees and customers in all parts of the world. \nIn developing an understanding \nof the meaning of principles of management, it is also useful to know what these are not. The principles of management should be distinguished from techniques of management. Techniques are procedures or methods, which involve a series of steps to be taken to accomplish desired goals. Principles are guidelines to take decisions or actions while practicing techniques. Likewise, principles should also be understood as being distinct from values. Values are something, which are acceptable or desirable. They have moral connotations. Principles are basic truths or guidelines for behaviour. Values are general rules for behaviour of individuals in society formed through common practice whereas principles of management are formed after research in work situations, which are technical in nature. However, while practicing principles of management values cannot be neglected, as businesses have to fulfil social and ethical responsibilities towards society.\nnature of PrinciPles  of \nManageMent\nBy nature is meant qualities and \ncharacteristics of anything. Principles are general propositions, which are applicable when certain conditions are present. These have been developed on the basis of observation and experimentation as well as personal experiences of the managers. Depending upon how they are derived and how effective they are in explaining and predicting managerial behaviour, they contribute towards the development of management both as a science and as an art. Derivation of these principles may be said to be a matter of science and their creative application may be regarded as an art. These principles lend credibility of a learnable and teachable discipline to the practice of management. As such, ascent to managerial position may not be a matter of birth, but a matter of requisite qualifications. \nClearly, management principles have gained importance with increasing professionalisation of management. \nThese principles are guidelines \nto action. They denote a cause and effect relationship.

                "text": "34\nBusiness Studies\ntaken while practising management, \nPrinciples help managers to take decisions while performing these functions. The following points summarise the nature of principles of management. \n (i) Universal applicability: The principles of \nmanagement are \nintended to apply to all types of organisations, business as well as non-business, small as well large, public sector as well as private sector, manufacturing as well as the services sectors. However, the extent of their applicability would vary with the nature of the organisation, business activity, scale of operations and the like. For example, for greater productivity, work should be divided into small tasks and each employee should be trained to perform his/her specialised job. This principle is applicable to a government office where there is a diary/despatch clerk whose job is to receive and send mail or documents, a data entry operator whose task is to input data on the computer, a peon and an officer etc. This principle is also applicable to a limited company where there are separate departments like Production, Finance, Marketing and Research and Development etc. Extent of division of work, however, may vary from case to case. \n (ii) General guidelines: The prin -\nciples are guidelines to \naction but do not provide readymade, straitjacket solutions to all managerial problems. This is so because real business situations are very complex and dynamic and are a result of many factors. However, the importance of principles cannot be underestimated because even a small guideline helps to solve a given problem. For example,  \nin dealing with a situation  \nof conflict between two departments, a manager may emphasise the primacy of the overall goals of the organisation. \n (iii) Formed by practice and experi­mentation: The principles of management are formed by experience and collective wisdom of managers as well as experimentation. For example, it is a matter of common experience that discipline is indispensable for accomplishing any purpose. This principle finds mention in management theory. On the other hand, in or\nder to remedy \nthe problem of fatigue of workers in the factory, an experiment may be conducted to see the effect of improvement of physical conditions to reduce stress.\n (iv) Flexibile: The principles of management are not r\nigid \nprescriptions, which have to be followed absolutely. They are flexible and can be modified by the manager when the situation \nCh_02.indd   34 24-09-2019   12:05:00 PM\nReprint 2024-25"

For example, the degree of concentration of authority (centralisation) or its dispersal (decentralisation) will depend upon the situations and circumstances of each enterprise. Moreover individual principles are like different tools serving different purposes, the manager has to decide which tool to use under what circumstances. \n (v) Mainly behavioural: Manage -\nment principles aim at influencing behaviour of human beings. Therefore, principles\n \nof management are mainly behavioural in nature. It is  \nnot that these principles do  \nnot pertain to things and phenomenon at all, it is just a matter of emphasis. Moreover, principles enable a better understanding of the relationship between human and material resources in accomplishing organisational purposes. For example, while planning the layout of a factory, orderliness would require that workflows are matched by flow of materials and movement of men.\n (vi)  Cause and effect relationships: The principles of management  \nare intended to establish relationship between cause and ef\nfect so that they can be used \nin similar situations in a large number of cases. As such, they tell us if a particular principle was applied in a particular situation, what would be its likely effect. The principles of management are less than perfect since they mainly apply to human behaviour. In real life, situations are not identical. So, accurate cause and effect relationships may be difficult  \nto establish. However,principles of management assist managers in establishing  \nthese relationships to some extent and are therefore useful. In situations of emergencies,  \nit is desirable that someone  \ntakes charge and others just follow. But in situations requiring cross-functional expertise, such as setting up of a new factory, more participative  \napproach to decision-making would be advisable. \n (vii) Contingent: The application of principles of management is contingent or dependent upon the prevailing situation \nat a \nparticular point of time. The application of principles has to be changed as per requirements. For example, employees deserve fair and just remuneration. But what is just and fair is determined by multiple factors. They include contribution of the employee, paying capacity of the employer and also prevailing \nCh_02.indd   35 24-09-2019   12:05:00 PM\nReprint 2024-25"

But before that you can read the following case study of ‘Kiran Mazumdar Shaw’ a highly successful Indian businesswoman and CEO of ‘Biocon’ in the accompanying box. You should be able to see how she was able to transform a little known sector of biotechnology into a very profitable company and earn titles which any one would dream of. \nFrom the foregoing story it is \nclear that success of Biocon due to the efforts of Dr. Kiran Mazumdar Shaw was not a mere chance.

For example, a manager can leave routine decision-making \nto his subordinates and deal with exceptional situations which require her/his expertise by following the principles of delegation. \n (ii) Optimum utilisation of resources \nand effective administration:  \nResources both human and  material \navailable with the \ncompany are limited. They have to be put to optimum use. By optimum use we mean that the resources should be put to use in such a manner that they should give maximum benefit with minimum cost. Principles equip the managers to foresee the cause and effect relationships  \nof their decisions and actions. As such the wastages associated with a trial-and-error approach can be overcome. Effective administration necessitates  \nimpersonalisation of managerial conduct so that managerial power is used with due discretion. Principles of management limit the boundary of managerial discretion so that their decisions may be free from personal prejudices and biases. For example, in deciding the annual budgets for different departments, rather than personal preferences, a part of management principles directly or indirectly. Now you can see the significance of these principles.\nsignificance  of PrinciPles  \nof ManageMent\nThe principles of management derive their significance from their utility. They provide useful insights to managerial behaviour and influence managerial practices. Managers may apply these principles to fulfil their tasks and responsibilities. Principles guide managers in taking and implementing decisions. It may be appreciated that everything worthwhile is governed by an underlying principle. The quest of the management theorists has been and should be to unearth the underlying principles with a view to using these under repetitive circums\n-\ntanc\nes as a matter of management \nhabit. The significance of principles of management can be discussed in terms of the following points:\n (i) Prov\niding managers with useful \ninsights into reality: The principles \nof management provide the \nmanagers with useful insights into real world situations. Adherence to these principles will add to their knowledge, ability and understanding of managerial situations and circumstances. It will also enable managers  \nto learn from past mistakes  \nand conserve time by solving recurring problems quickly. As \nCh_02.indd   37 24-09-2019   12:05:01 PM\nReprint 2024-25"

They must be timely, realistic and subject to measurement and evaluation. Management principles help in thoughtful decision-making. They emphasise logic rather than blind faith. Management decisions taken on the basis of principles are free from bias and prejudice. They are based on the objective assessment of the situation. \n (iv) Meeting changing environment requirements: Although the principles are in the natur\ne \nof general guidelines but they are modified and as such help managers to meet changing requirements of the environment. You have already studied that management principles are flexible to adapt to dynamic business environment. For example, management principles emphasise division of work and specialisation. In modern times this principle has been extended to the entire business whereby companies are specialising in  \ntheir core competency and divesting non-core businesses. In this context, one may cite the decision of Hindustan Lever Limited in divesting non-core businesses of chemicals and seeds. Some companies are outsourcing their non-core activities like share-transfer management and advertising to outside agencies. So much so, that even core processes such as R&D, manufacturing and marketing are being outsourced today. Haven’t you heard of proliferation of ‘Business Process Outsourcing’ (BPO) and ‘Knowledge Process Outsourcing’ (KPO)?\n (v) Fulfilling social responsibility: The increased awareness of the public, \nforces businesses \nespecially limited companies to fulfill their social responsibilities. Management theory and management principles have also evolved in response to these demands. Moreover, the interpretation of the principles also assumes newer and contemporary meanings with the change in time. So, if one were to talk of ‘equity’ today, it does not apply to wages alone. Value to the customer, care for the environment, dealings with business associates would all come under the purview of this principle. As an application of this principle, we find that Public Sector Undertakings have developed entire townships as, for example, BHEL has developed Ranipur in Hardwar \nCh_02.indd   38 24-09-2019   12:05:01 PM\nReprint 2024-25"

As such these are used as a basis for management training, education and research. You must be aware that entrance to management institutes is preceded by management aptitude tests. Do you think that these tests could have been developed without an understanding of management principles and how they may be applied in different situations? These principles provide basic groundwork for the development of management as a discipline. Professional courses such as MBA (Master of Business Administration), BBA (Bachelor of Business Administration) also teach these principles as part  \nof their curriculum at the beginner’s level.   These principles enable \nrefinement of management p\nractices as well by facilitating the \ndevelopment of new management techniques. Thus, we see that techniques like Operations Research (OR), cost accounting, ‘Just in Time’, ‘Kanban’ and ‘Kaizen’ have developed due to further research on these principles. \nIn conclusion it can be said that \nunderstanding the meaning, nature and significance of principles of management will help us to appreciate their applicability in real life situations. \nAs stated at the beginning of the \nchapter, management principles have undergone a long history of evolution.

It shows how an organisation can combine business with social responsibility and make its stakeholders self-reliant. The stakeholders are various women who, numbering over 45,000, are given the task of making lijjat papads, which are famous for their quality throughout the world.    The organisation started with a modest loan of Rs 80 and is now worth around Rs 650 crores. Its exports exceed Rs 60 crores. Their exports are made through Merchant Exporters to countries like UK, USA, Middle East Countries, Thailand, Singapore, Hongkong, Holland, Japan, Australia and other Countries.\nOne of the main reasons for their success can be attributed to their core \nvalues to which they have stuck to since its inception in 1959. It has shown how it is possible to combine Gandhian values with business. Shri Mahila Griha Udyog Lijjat Papad is a synthesis of three different concepts (core values) namely: \n1. The concept of business \n2. The concept of family 3. The concept of devotion \nAll these concepts are uniformly followed in this institution. As a result of \nthis synthesis, a peculiar Lijjat way of thinking has developed therein.\nBesides the concept of business, the institution along with all its member \nsisters has adopted the concept of mutual family affection, concern and trust. All the affairs of the institution are dealt with in a manner similar to that of a family carrying out its own daily household chores. But the most important concept adopted by the institution is the concept of devotion. For the member-sisters, employees and well-wishers, the institution is never merely a place to earn one’s livelihood — it is a place of worship to devote one’s energy not for his or her own benefits but for the benefit of all. Lijjat’ provides scholarships to the children of the papad roller sister members who pass out in 10th and 12th standard every year so as to enable the Lady Members to encourage their children for education. \nSource: Adapted from http/www.lijjat.comShri Mahila Griha Udyog Lijjat Papad- Combining \nbusiness with social responsibility (An organization of \nthe women, by the women and for the women)\nCh_02.indd   40 24-09-2019   12:05:01 PM\nReprint 2024-25"

Taylor’s contribution must be seen in the light of the efforts \nmade to perfect the factory system of production. \nTaylor thought that by scientifically \nanalysing work, it would be possible to find ‘one best way’ to do it.  \nHe is most remembered for his time and motion studies. He would break a job into its component parts and measure each to the second.\nTaylor believed that contemporary \nmanagement was amateurish and should be studied as a discipline. He also wanted that workers should cooperate with the management and thus there would be no need of trade unions. The best results would come from the partnership between a trained and qualified management and a cooperative and innovative workforce. Each side needed the other.\nHe is known for coinage of the \nterm ‘Scientific Management’ in his \narticle ‘The Principles of Scientific \nManagement’ published in 1911. After being fired from Bethlehem Steel Company he wrote a book ‘Shop floor’ which sold well. He was selected to be the president of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) from 1906 to 1907. He was a professor at Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth College founded in 1900. \nIn 1884 he became an executive \nat Midvale Steel Company by demonstrating his leadership abilities. He instructed his fellow workers to work in phases. He joined \nthe Bethlehem Iron Company in 1898, which later became Bethlehem Steel Company. He was originally employed to introduce piece rate wage system. After setting up the wage system, he was given authority and more responsibilities in the company. Using his newfound resources he increased the staff and made Bethlehem a show place for inventive work. Unfortunately, the company was sold to another group and he was discharged.\nIn 1910 his health started to fall. \nHe died in 1915 due to pneumonia. A synoptic view of his contribution can be had from the accompanying box on the next page. \nPrinciPles  of scientific  \nManageMent\nIn the earlier days of the Industrial Revolution, in the absence of an established theory of factory organisation, factory owners or managers relied on personal judgment in attending to the problems they confronted in the course of managing their work. This is what is referred to as ‘rule of thumb’. Managing factories by rule of thumb enabled them to handle the situations as they arose but suffered from the limitation of a trial and error approach. For their experiences to be emulated, it was important to know what works and why does it work. For this, there was \nCh_02.indd   42 24-09-2019   12:05:01 PM\nReprint 2024-25"

This one implement, then is adopted as standard in place of the many different kinds before in use and it remains standard for all workmen to use until superseded by an implement which has been shown, through motion and time study, to be still better.” (Scientific management, page 119)\nThe main elements of the Scientific Management are: (page 129-130  \nsci-mgt) “Time Studies”\nFunctional or specialised supervision Standardisation of tools and implements Standardisation of work methodsSeparate Planning functionManagement by exception principleThe use of ‘slide-rules and similar time-saving devices’ Instruction cards for workmenTask allocation and large bonus for successful performance The use of the ‘differential rate’Mnemonic systems for classifying products and implements A routing systemA modern costing system etc. etc. Taylor called these elements “merely the elements or details of the \nmechanisms of management” He saw them as extensions of the four principles of management.

He proposed scientific management as opposed to rule of thumb. He broke up human activity into small parts and found out how it could be done effectively, in less time and with increased productivity. It implies conducting business activities according to standardised tools, methods and trained personnel in order to increase the output, improve its quality and reduce costs and wastes.\nIn the words of Taylor, “Scientific \nmanagement means knowing exactly what you want men to do and seeing that they do it in the best and cheapest way. The Bethlehem Steel company where Taylor himself worked achieved three-fold increase in productivity by application of scientific management principles. Therefore, it would be in order to discuss these principles. \n (i) Science\n not Rule of Thumb:  \nTaylor pioneered the introduction of the method of scientific inquiry into the domain of management practice. We have  \nalready referred to the limitations of the rule of thumb approach of management. As different managers would follow their indigenous rules of thumb, it is but a statement of the obvious that all would not be equally effective. Taylor believed that there was only one best method to maximise efficiency. This method can be developed through study and analysis. The method so developed should substitute ‘Rule of Thumb’ throughout the organisation. Scientific method involved investigation of traditional methods through work-study, unifying the best practices and developing a standard method, which would be followed throughout the organisation. According to Taylor, even a small production activity like loading pigs of iron into boxcars can be scientifically planned and managed. This can result in tremendous saving of human energy as well as wastage of time and materials. The more sophisticated the processes, greater would be the savings.\n   In the present context, the \nuse of Internet has \nbrought \nabout dramatic improvements in internal efficiencies and customer satisfaction. \n (ii) Harmony, Not Discord: Factory system of production implied that managers served as a link between\n \nthe owners and the workers. Since as managers they had the mandate to ‘get work done’ from the workers, it should not be \nCh_02.indd   44 24-09-2019   12:05:01 PM\nReprint 2024-25"

It means that management and workers should transform their thinking. In such a situation even trade unions will not think of going on strike etc.\n   Management should share the \ngains of the company, if any, with the workers. At the same time workers should work har\nd and difficult for you to appreciate that there always existed the possibility of a kind of class-conflict, the mangers versus workers. Taylor recognised that this conflict helped none, the workers, the managers or the factory owners. He emphasised that there should be complete harmony between the management and workers. Both should realise that each one is important. To achieve this \nSharing of gains between management and workers leading to complete harmony\nCh_02.indd   45 24-09-2019   12:05:02 PM\nReprint 2024-25"

According to Taylor, ‘Scientific management has for its foundation the firm conviction that the true interests of the two are one and the same; that prosperity for the employer cannot exist for a long time unless it is accompanied by prosperity  \nfor the employees and vice versa’.\n   Japanese work culture is a  \nclassic example of such a  \nsituation. In Japanese companies,\n \npaternalistic style of management is in practice. There is complete openness between the manage\n-\nment and workers. If at all workers go to strike they wear a black badge but \nwork more than \nnormal working hours to gain the sympathy of the management.\n (iii) Cooperation, Not Individualism:  \nThere should be complete cooperation between the labour and the management instead\n  \nof individualism. This principle is  \nan extension of principle of ‘Harmony not discord’. Competition should be replaced by cooperation. Both should realise that they need  \neach other.\n   For this, management should  \nnot clos\ne its ears to any \nconstructive suggestions made by the employees.  \nThey should be rewarded for their suggestions which results in substantial reduction in costs. They should be part of management and, if any important decisions are taken, workers should be taken into confidence.\n   At the\n same time workers \nshould desist from going on strike and making unreasonable demands on the management. In fact when there will be open communication system and goodwill there will be no need for even a trade union. Paternalistic style of management, whereby the employer takes care of the needs of employees, would prevail as in the case of Japanese companies.\n   According to Taylor, ther\ne \nshould be an almost equal division of work and responsibility between workers and management. All the day long the management should work almost side by side with the workers helping, encouraging and smoothing the way for them.\n (iv) Development of Each and Every Person to His or Her Greatest Efficiency and Prosperity:  \nIndustrial efficiency depends to a lar\nge extent on personnel \ncompetencies. As such, scientific management also stood for worker development. Worker training was essential also to learn the ‘best method’ developed as a consequence of \nCh_02.indd   46 24-09-2019   12:05:02 PM\nReprint 2024-25"

Each person should be scientifically selected. Then work assigned should suit her/his physical, mental and intellectual capabilities. To increase efficiency, they should be given the required training. Efficient employees would produce more and earn more. This will ensure their greatest efficiency and prosperity for both company and workers.\nFrom the foregoing discussion it \nis clear that Taylor was an ardent \nsupporter of use of scientific method of production in business.\ntechniques  of scientific  \nManageMent\nLet us now discuss techniques as specified by him. These are based on the various experiments he conducted during his career.\nfunctional  foreManshiP\nIn the factory system, the foreman \nrepresents the managerial figure with whom the workers are in face-to-face contact on a daily basis. In the first chapter of the book, you have seen that the foreman is the lowest ranking manager and the highest ranking worker. He is the pivot around whom revolves the entire production planning, implementation and control. Thus, Taylor concentrated on improving the performance of this role in the factory set-up. In fact, he identified a list of qualities of a good foreman/supervisor and found that no single person could fit them all. This prompted him to suggest functional foremanship through eight persons.\nTaylor advocated separation of \nplanning and execution functions. This concept was extended to the lowest level of the shop floor. It was known as functional foremanship. Under the factory manager there was a planning incharge and a production incharge. Under planning incharge four personnel namely instruction card clerk, route clerk, time and cost clerk and a disciplinarian worked. These four personnel would draft instructions for the workers, specify the route of production, prepare  \ntime and cost sheet and ensure discipline respectively.\nUnder Production incharge, \npersonnel who would work were \nspeed boss, gang boss, repair boss, and inspector. These respectively were responsible for timely and accurate completion of job, keeping machines and tools etc., ready for operation by workers, ensure proper working condition of machines and tools and check the quality of work.\nFunctional foremanship is an \nextension of the principle of division of work and specialisation to the shop floor. Each worker will have to \nCh_02.indd   47 24-09-2019   12:05:02 PM\nReprint 2024-25"

Foremen should have intelligence, education, tact, grit, judgment, special knowledge, manual dexterity, and energy, honesty and good health. Since all these qualities could not be found in a single person so Taylor proposed eight specialists. Each specialist is to be assigned work according to her/his qualities. For example, those with technical mastery, intelligence and grit may be given planning work. Those with energy and good health may be assigned execution work.\nstandardisation  and \nsiMPlification  of Work\nTaylor was an ardent supporter of \nstandardisation. According to him \nscientific method should be used to analyse methods of production prevalent under the rule of thumb. The best practices can be kept and further refined to develop a standard which should be followed throughout the organisation. This can be done through work-study techniques which include time study, motion study, fatigue study and method study, and which are discussed further in this chapter. It may be pointed out that even the contemporary techniques of business process including reengineering, kaizen (continuous improvement) and benchmarking are aimed at standardising the work. \nStandardisation refers to the process \nof setting standards for every business activity; it can be standardisation of process, raw material, time, product, machinery, methods or working conditions. These standards are the benchmarks, which must be adhered to during production.

Simplification aims at eliminating unnecessary diversity of products. It results in savings of cost of labour, machines and tools. It implies reduced inventories, fuller utilisation of equipment and increasing turnover. \nMost large companies like Nokia,  \nToyota and Microsoft, etc. have successfully implemented standardi­sation and simplification. This is evident from their large share in their respective markets.\nMethod  Study\nThe objective of method study is to find out one best way of doing the job. There are various methods of doing the job. To determine the best way there are several parameters. Right from procurement of raw materials till the final product is delivered to the customer every activity is part of method study. Taylor devised  \nthe concept of assembly line by  \nusing method study. Ford Motor Company used this concept very successfully. Even now auto companies are using it.\nThe objective of the whole exercise is \nto minimise the cost of production and maximise the quality and satisfaction of the customer. For this purpose many techniques like process charts and operations research etc are used.\nFor designing a car, the assembly \nline production would entail deciding the sequence of operations, place for men, machines and raw materials etc. All this is part of method study.\nMotion Study\nMotion study refers to the study of movements like lifting, putting objects, sitting and changing positions, etc., which are undertaken while doing a typical job. Unnecessary movements are sought to be eliminated so that it takes less time to complete the job efficiently. For example, Taylor and his associate Frank Gailberth were able to reduce motions in brick layering from 18 to just 5. Taylor demonstrated that productivity increased to about four times by this process.\nOn close examination of body \nmotions, for example, it is possible to find out:\n (i) Motions which are productive\n (ii) Motions which are incidental (e.g., going to stores)\n (iii) Motions which are unproductive.\nTaylor used stopwatches and various  \ns\nymbols and colours to identify \ndifferent motions.

The results achieved by him were truly remarkable.\ntiMe study\nIt determines the standard time taken to perform a well-defined job. Time measuring devices are used for each element of task. The standard time is fixed for the whole of the task by taking several readings. The method of time study will depend upon volume and frequency of the task, the cycle time of the operation and time measurement costs. The objective of time study is to determine the number of workers to be employed; frame suitable incentive schemes and determine labour costs.\nFor example, on the basis of \nseveral observations it is determined that standard time taken by the worker to make one cardboard box is 20 minutes. So in one hour she/he will make 3 boxes. Assuming that a worker has to put in 8 hours of work in a shift and deducting one hour for rest and lunch, it is determined that in 7 hours a worker makes 21 boxes @ 3 boxes per hour. Now this is the standard task a worker has to do. Wages can be decided accordingly.\nfatigue  study\nA person is bound to feel tired physically and mentally if she/he does not rest while working. The rest intervals will help one to regain stamina and work again with the same capacity. This will result in increased productivity. Fatigue study seeks to determine the amount and frequency of rest intervals in completing a task. For example, normally in a plant, work takes place in three shifts of eight hours each. Even in a single shift a worker has to be given some rest interval to take her/his lunch etc. If the work involves heavy manual labour then small pauses have to be frequently given to the worker so that she/he can recharge her/his energy level for optimum contribution. \nThere can be many causes for \nfatigue like long working hours,  \ndoing unsuitable work, having uncordial relations with the boss or bad working conditions etc. Such hindrances in good performance should be removed.\ndifferential  Piece Wage \nsysteM\nTaylor was a strong advocate of piece wage system. He wanted to differentiate between efficient and inefficient workers. The standard time and other parameters should be determined on the basis of the work-study discussed above. The workers can then be classified as efficient or inefficient on the basis of these standards. He wanted to reward efficient workers. So he introduced different rate of wage payment for \nCh_02.indd   50 24-09-2019   12:05:02 PM\nReprint 2024-25"

For example, it is determined that standard output per worker per day is 10 units and those who made standard or more than standard will get Rs. 50 per unit and those below will get Rs. 40 per unit. Now an efficient worker making 11 units will get 11�50= Rs. 550 per day whereas a worker who makes 9 units will get 9××�40 = Rs. 360 per day.\nAccording to Taylor, the difference \nof Rs. 190 should be enough for the inefficient worker to be motivated to perform better. From his own experience, Taylor gives the example of a worker named Schmidt who was able to earn 60% more wages from $1.15 to $1.85 on increasing pig iron loading from 12.5 tons per man per day to 47 tons per man per day in box cars at Bethlehem Steel works by following scientific management techniques.\nIt is important to have a relook at the \ntechniques of scientific management as comprising a unified whole of Taylor’s prescription of efficiency. Search for efficiency requires the search for one best method and the chosen method must lead to the determination of a fair day’s work. There must be a compensation system that differentiates those who are able to accomplish/exceed the fair day’s work. This differential system must be based on the premise that efficiency is the result of the joint efforts of the managers and the workers. Thus, rather than quarrelling over the share in the resultant surplus, the workers and managers should work in harmony for maximising the output rather than restricting it. Clearly the sum and substance of Taylor’s ideas lies not in the disjointed description of principles and techniques of scientific management, but in the change of the mindset, which he referred to as mental revolution. Mental revolution involves a change in the attitude of workers and management towards one another from competition to cooperation. Both should realise that they require one another. Both should aim to increase the size of surplus. This would eliminate the need for any agitation. Management should share a part of surplus with workers. Workers should also contribute their might so that the company makes profits. This attitude will be good for both of them and also for the company. In the long run only worker’s well-being will ensure prosperity of the business. \nNow, having studied the elements, \nprinciples and techniques of scientific management we can consider the practical applications of the same at the time of F.W. Taylor and in the present.\nWe can also examine the present \nstatus of scientific management. Today, many new techniques have been developed as a sequel to scientific management. Operations research was developed in the second World War to optimise the deployment of war material. Similarly assembly line was \nCh_02.indd   51 24-09-2019   12:05:02 PM\nReprint 2024-25"

Taylor’s associate Frank Gilbreth \napplied scientific management to the art \nof ‘brick layering’ and through motion study was able to eliminate certain motions which were considered by the brick layers to be necessary (reduced motions from 18 to 5), designed simple apparatus like adjustable scaffold and its packets to hold the bricks and finally also taught brick layers to use both the hands at the same time. This is a classic example of application of Scientific Management to the simple art of brick layering.Applications of Scientific Management \nby T aylor and his Contemporaries\nCh_02.indd   52 24-09-2019   12:05:02 PM\nReprint 2024-25"

Fayol was the first to identify four functions of management – Planning, Organising, Directing and Controlling although his version was a bit different – Plan, Organise, Command, Coordinate and Control. According to Fayol, all activities of an industrial undertaking could be divided into: Technical; Commercial; Financial; Security; Accounting and Managerial. He also suggested that qualities a manager must possess should be — Physical, Moral, Education, Knowledge and experience. He believed that the number of management principles that might help to improve an organisation’s operation is potentially limitless.\nBased largely on his own \nexperience, he developed his concept of administration. The 14 principles of management propounded by him were discussed in detail in his book published in 1917, ‘Administration industrielle et generale’. It was published in English as ‘General and Industrial Management’ in 1949 and is widely considered a foundational work in classical management theory. For his contribution he is also known as the ‘Father of General Management’\nThe 14 principles of management \ngiven by him are:\n (i) Division of Work: Work is divided into small tasks/jobs. A trained specialist who\n \nis competent is required to perform each job. Thus, division of work leads to specialisation. According to Fayol, “The intent of division of work is to produce more and better work for the same effort. Specialisation is the most efficient way to use human effort.” \n   In business work can be \nperformed mor\ne efficiently if it \nis divided into specialised tasks; each performed by a specialist or trained employee. This results in efficient and effective output. Thus, in a company we  \nhave separate departments  \nfor finance, marketing, production and human resource development etc. All of them have specialised persons. Collectively they achieve production and sales targets of the company. Fayol applies this principle of division of work to all kinds of work – technical as well as \nCh_02.indd   54 24-09-2019   12:05:02 PM\nReprint 2024-25"

You can observe this principle at work in any organisation like hospital or even a government office.\n (ii) Authority and Responsibility: According to Fayol, “Authority is \nthe right to give orders \nand obtain obedience, and responsibility is the corollary of authority. The two types of authority are official authority, which is the authority to command, and personal authority which is the authority of the individual manager.”Authority is both formal and \ninformal. Managers require authority commensurate with their responsibility. There should be a balance between authority and responsibility. An organisation should build safeguards against abuse of managerial power. At the same time a manager should have necessary authority to carry out his responsibility. For example, a sales manager has to negotiate a deal with a buyer. She finds that if she can offer credit period of 60 days she is likely to clinch the deal which is supposed to fetch the company net margin of say \nCh_02.indd   55 24-09-2019   12:05:02 PM\nReprint 2024-25"

This shows that there is an imbalance in authority and responsibility. In this case the manager should be granted authority of offering credit period of 60 days in the interest of the company. Similarly, in this example this manager should not be given a power to offer a credit period of say 100 days because it is not required. A manager should have the right to punish a subordinate for wilfully not obeying a legitimate order but only after sufficient opportunity has been given to a subordinate for presenting her/his case.\n (iii) Discipline: Discipline is the obedience to organisational rules and employment agr\neement which \nare necessary for the working of the organisation. According to Fayol, discipline requires good superiors at all levels, clear and fair agreements and judicious application of penalties.\n   Suppose management and \nlabour union have entered into an agr\neement whereby workers \nhave agreed to put in extra hours without any additional payment to revive the company out of loss. In return the management has promised to increase wages of the workers when this mission is accomplished. Here discipline when applied would mean that the workers and management both honour their commitments without any prejudice towards one another.\n (iv) Unity of Command: According to Fayol there should be one and only one boss for every individual employee. If an employee gets or\nders from two superiors at the \nsame time the principle of unity of command is violated. The principle of unity of command states that each participant in a formal organisation should receive orders from and be responsible to only one superior. Fayol gave a lot of importance to this principle. He felt that if this principle is violated “authority is undermined, discipline is in jeopardy, order disturbed and stability threatened”. The principle resembles military organisation. Dual subordination should be avoided. This is to prevent confusion regarding tasks to be done. Suppose a sales person is asked to clinch a deal with a buyer and is allowed to give 10% discount by the marketing manager. But finance department tells her/him not to offer more than 5% discount. Now there is no unity of command. This can be avoided if there is coordination between various departments.\n (v) Unity of Direction: All the units of an organisation should be moving towar\nds the same \nobjectives through coordinated \nCh_02.indd   56 24-09-2019   12:05:03 PM\nReprint 2024-25"

                "text": "Principles of Management57\nand focussed efforts. Each group \nof activities having the same objective must have one head and one plan. This ensures unity of action and coordination. For example, if a company is manufacturing motorcycles as well as cars then it should have two separate divisions for both of them. Each division should have its own incharge, plans and execution resources. On no account should the working of two divisions overlap. Now let us differentiate between the two principles of unity of command and unity of direction.\n (vi) Subordination of Individual \nInterest to General Interest: The interests of an or\nganisation \nshould take priority over the interests of any one individual employee according to Fayol. Every worker has some individual interest for working in a company. The company has got its own objectives. For example, the company would want to get maximum output from its employees at a competitive cost (salary). On the other hand, an employee may want to get maximum salary while working the least. In another situation an individual employee may demand some concession, which is not admissible to any other employee like working for less time. \n   In all the situations the \ninterests of the gr\noup/company \nwill supersede the interest of any one individual. This is so because larger interests of the workers and stakeholders are more important than the  \ninterest of any one person. For example, interests of various stakeholders, i.e., owners, shareholders, creditors, debtors, financers, tax authorities, customers and the society at large cannot be sacrificed for \nDifference betweeen Unity of Command and Unity of Direction\nBasis Unity of Command Unity of Direction\n1.

For example, she/he should not fall into temptation of misusing her/his powers for individual/ family benefit at the cost of larger general interest of the workers/ company. This will raise her/his stature in the eyes of the workers and at the same time ensure same behaviour by them. \n (vii) Remuneration of Employees: The overall pay and compensation should be fair to both employees and the organisation. The employees should be paid fair wages, which should give them at least a r\neasonable standard of \nliving. At the same time it should be within the paying capacity of the company. In other words, remuneration should be just and equitable. This will ensure congenial atmosphere and good relations between workers and management. Consequently, the working of the company would be smooth.\n (viii)Centralisation and Decentr­\nalisation: The concentration of decision-making \nauthority is \ncalled centralisation whereas its dispersal among more than one person is  known as decentralisation. According to Fayol, “There is a need to balance subordinate involvement through decentra\n lisation with managers’ \nretention of final \nauthority \nthrough centralisation.” The degree of centralisation will depend upon the circumstances in which the company is working. In general large organisations have more decentralisation than small organisations. For example, panchayats in our country have been given more powers to decide and spend funds granted to them by the government for the welfare of villages. This is decentralisation at the  \nnational level.\n (ix) Scalar Chain: An organisation\n \nconsists of superiors and subordinates. The formal lines of authority from highest to lowest ranks are known as scalar chain.\n   According to Fayol, “Organisa-\ntions should have a chain of authority and communication\n \nthat runs from top to bottom and should be followed by managers and the subordinates.”\n   Let us consider a situation where \nth\nere is one head ‘A’ who has \ntwo lines of authority under her/him. One line consists of B-C-D-E-F. Another line of authority under ‘A’ is L-M-N-O-P. If ‘E’ has  \nto communicate with ‘O’ who is  \nat the same level of authority  \nthen she/he has to traverse the route E-D-C-B-A-L-M-N-O. This is due to the principle of scalar \nCh_02.indd   58 24-09-2019   12:05:03 PM\nReprint 2024-25"

According to Fayol, this chain should not be violated in the normal course of formal communication. However, if there  \nis an emergency then ‘E’ can directly contact ‘O’ through ‘Gang Plank’ as shown in the diagram. This is a shorter route and  \nhas been provided so that communication is not delayed. In practice you find that a worker cannot directly contact the CEO of the company. If at all she/he has to, then all the formal levels i.e., foreman, superintendent, manager, director etc have to know about the matter. However, in an emergency it can be possible that a worker can contact CEO directly.  (x) Order: According to Fayol, “People and materials must be in suitable places at appropriate time for maximum ef\nficiency.” \nThe principle of order states that ‘A place for everything (everyone) and everything (everyone) in its (her/his) place’. Essentially it means orderliness. If there is a fixed place for everything and it is present there, then there will be no hindrance in the activities of business/ factory. This will lead to increased productivity and efficiency.\n (xi) Equity: Good sense and experience are needed to ensure fair\nness to all employees, who \nshould be treated as fairly as possible,” according to Fayol. This principle emphasises kindliness and justice in the behaviour of managers towards workers. This will ensure loyalty and devotion. Fayol does not rule out use of force sometimes. Rather he says that lazy personnel should be dealt with sternly to send the message that everyone is equal in the eyes of the management. There should be no discrimination against anyone on account of sex, religion, language, caste, belief or nationality etc. In practice we can observe that now a days in multinational corporations people of various nationalities work together in a \nCh_02.indd   59 24-09-2019   12:05:03 PM\nReprint 2024-25"

Personnel should be selected and appointed after due and rigorous procedure. But once selected they should be kept at their post/position for a minimum fixed tenure. They should have stability of tenure. They should be given reasonable time to show results. Any adhocism in this regard will create instability/insecurity among employees. They would tend to leave the organisation. Recruitment, selection and training cost will be high. So stability in tenure of personnel is good for the business.\nEmployee suggestion system: Encourage \ninitiative among trainee managers\nCh_02.indd   60 24-09-2019   12:05:05 PM\nReprint 2024-25"

Then and Now- A Framework For Managing T oday’s Organisations Effectively” published in Journal “Management Decision” 39/10(2001) PP 880-889.\nFayol: Then and Now\nCh_02.indd   61 24-09-2019   12:05:05 PM\nReprint 2024-25"

Initiative means taking the first step with self-motivation. It is thinking out and executing the plan. It is one of the traits of an intelligent person. Initiative should be encouraged. But it does not mean going against the established practices of the company for the sake of being different. A good company should have an employee suggestion system whereby initiative/suggestions which result in substantial cost/time reduction should be rewarded.\n (xiv) Esprit De Corps: Management \nshould promote a team spirit of unity and har\nmony among \nemployees, according to Fayol. Management should promote teamwork especially in large organisations because otherwise objectives would be difficult to realise. It will also result in a loss of coordination. A manager should replace ‘I’ with ‘We’ in all his conversations with workers to foster team spirit. This will give rise to a spirit of mutual trust and belongingness among team members. It will also minimise the need for using penalties. From the foregoing discussion it \nis clear that Fayol’s 14 principles of management are widely applicable to managerial problems and have cast a profound impact on management thinking today. But with the change of environment in which business is done, the interpretation of these principles has changed. For example, authority and responsibility meant empowering of managers but now it means empowerment of employees because of flat organisational structures that are gaining ground. We are now in a position to understand the current connotations of Fayol’s principles discussed in the accompanying box.\nFayol Versus Taylor — \na Comparison\nWe are now in a position to compare the contributions of both Fayol and Taylor. Both of them have contributed immensely to the knowledge of management, which has formed a basis for further practice by managers. It must be pointed out that their contributions are complementary to each other. We can make out the following points of difference between their contributions.\nYou may also like to have some \nknowledge of contributions of Indians to the growth of management knowledge which can be seen in the accompanying box item.\nCh_02.indd   62 05-11-2019   3:36:01 PM\nReprint 2024-25"

The significance can be discussed under the following heads- Increase in efficiency; Optimum utilisation of resources; Scientific decision making; Adaptation to changing environment; Fulfilling social responsibilities; Proper research and development; Training managers; and Effective administration.Scientific ManagementTaylor’s principles of scientific management are — Science, not the rule of thumb; Harmony not discord; Cooperation not individualism; Maximum not restricted output; Development of each person to her/his greatest efficiency and prosperity. The techniques of scientific management as per Taylor were — Functional foremanship; Standardisation and simplification of work; Fatigue Study; Method Study; Time Study; Motion Study; and Differential Wage System. We can also point out differences between the contributions of Taylor and Fayol but essentially they were complementary in nature.Fayol’s Principles of ManagementAccording to Fayol, the functions of management are to plan, to organise, to command, to coordinate and to control. The activities of an industrial undertaking could be divided into; Technical; Commercial; Financial; Security; Accounting and Managerial. He also suggested that managers should have the following qualities- Physical; Moral; Education; Knowledge; and Experience. Fayol listed 14 principles of management — Division of work; Authority and responsibility; Discipline; Unity of command; Unity of direction; Subordination of individual interest to general interest; Remuneration of Personnel; Centralisation and decentralisation; Scalar Chain; Order; Equity; Stability in the tenure of Personnel; Initiative; and Espirit De corps.\nWe can also point out differences between the contributions of Taylor \nand Fayol but essentially they were complementary in nature.\nCh_02.indd   64 24-09-2019   12:05:06 PM\nReprint 2024-25"

Lately the business was expanding due to good quality and reasonable prices. Also with more people working the market for processed food was increasing. New players were also coming to cash in on the new trend. In order to keep its market share in the short run the company directed its existing workforce to work overtime. But this resulted in many problems. Due to increased pressure of work the efficiency of the workers declined. Sometimes the subordinates had to work for more than one superior resulting in declining efficiency. The divisions that were previously working on one product were also made to work on two or more products. \nCh_02.indd   66 28-10-2019   4:46:26 PM\nReprint 2024-25"

This was an event that would change his life forever. Knowing that he wouldn’t be able to go back to his work, he made the decision of returning to his native village in the Yamunanagar district of Haryana to begin life anew. Being a school dropout with no technical training of any kind further restricted his scope in terms of employment.\nThe desire to do something out of the ordinary kept stirring \nin his heart time and again. He was on the lookout for the right inspiration and opportunity. Such an opportunity crossed his path during one of his visits to the outskirts of Jaipur, Ajmer and Pushkar regions of Rajasthan, where he observed a number of women self help groups at work. A common sight was women in the process of making gooseberry laddoos. While this process appeared to be rather simple, the grating of gooseberries on slabs of stone manually with hands was an excruciatingly  painful exercise. There were machines available that could process the gooseberrys but none of them proved to be cost effective. The industry was so small in scale and the owners so modest in means that it was impossible for them to buy machines and put them in use.  Dharamveer Kamboj began to think of ways of making fruit and vegetable processing machines not only affordable, but also free of accidental health hazards. Observing that cutting, grating, juicing and pulverizing involved similar techniques made him come up with the idea of a multipurpose processing machine that could work equally well for all of these tasks. There was however a big hurdle in the way of Dharamveer. His limited education would prove his task to be an uphill battle. He however was not deterred. He knew problems would come his way, but to challenge and overcome them was his motto in life. “Sangharsh hi sabse badi kaamyaabi hai. Agar badhna hai toh \npeeche mud kar nahin dekhna hai.”  How a Rickshaw Puller became an entrepreneur\nCh_03.indd   69 08-08-2022   09:37:32\nReprint 2024-25"

He began work immediately. The first prototype of his machine was ready in March 2005. An unexpected problem of overheating however cropped up. Even after Dharamveer’s constant trials for the elimination of this problem, the issue still persisted in the second prototype.  But the thought of giving up never crossed Dharamveer’s mind. In his third prototype, he had successfully solved the problem of overheating at last. This prototype was bought by GIAN North and sent to Kenya on a pilot basis. Based on the feedback, GIAN asked him to modify it further incorporating provisions that would make it portable, including the incorporation of foldable legs. In the fourth machine he also incorporated a sieve to manage the flow of juice from the machine during the extraction process. The machine that Dharamveer developed is unique in a way  that it has the capacity to process a wide variety of products without damaging the seed of the fruit or vegetable. \nThe above example shows how a machine invented by Dharamveer Kamboj made life easier for women  workers in unorganised sector. This innovation resulted in a positive impact on food processing business \ni.e., social, economic and technological \nin addition to enhancing quality  \nof life.\nMeaning  of Business  \nenvironMent\nThe term ‘business environment’ \nmeans  the sum total of all \nindividuals, institutions and other \nforces that are outside the control\n \nof a business enterprise but that may affect its performance. As one writer has put it– “Just take the universe, subtract from it the subset \nthat represents the organisation, and the remainder is environment”. Thus, the economic, social, political, technological and other forces which operate outside a business enterprise are part of its environment. So also, the individual consumers or competing enterprises as well as the governments, consumer groups, competitors, courts, media and other institutions working outside an enterprise constitute its environment. The important point is that these individuals, institutions and forces are likely to influence the performance of a business enterprise although they happen to exist outside its boundaries. For example, changes in government’s economic Source: The National Innovation Foundation \n(NIF) – India (nif.org.in)\nCh_03.indd   70 08-08-2022   09:37:32\nReprint 2024-25"

Increase in taxes by government can make things expensive to buy. Technological improvements may render existing products obsolete. Political uncertainty may create fear in the minds of investors. Changes in fashions and tastes of consumers may shift demand in the market from existing products to new ones. Increased competition in the market may reduce profit margins  \nof firms.\nOn the basis of the foregoing \ndisc\n ussion, it can be said business \nenvironment, has the following features: \n (i) Totality of external forces: \nBusiness environment is the sum total of all things external to business firms and, as such, is aggregative in natur\ne.\n (ii) Specific and general forces:  \nBusiness environment includes both specific and general forces. Specific for\nces (such as investors, \ncustomers, competitors and supp­liers) affect individual enterprises directly and immediately in their day\n­to­day working. \nGeneral forces (such as social, political, legal and technological conditions) have impact on all\n \nbusiness enterprises and thus may affect an individual firm  \nonly indirectly. (iii) Inter-r elatedness: Different \nelements or parts of business \nenvironment are closely inter ­\nrelated. For example, increased life expectancy of people and increased awar\neness for health  \ncare have increased the demand for many health products and services like soft drinks, fat\n­free \ncooking oil, and health resorts. New health products and\n \nservices have, in turn, changed people’s life styles.\n (iv) Dynami\nc nature: Business \nenvironment is dynamic in that \nit keeps on changing whether in terms of technological imp­rovement, shifts in consumer preferences or entry of new competition in the market.\n (v) Uncertainty: Business envir­\nonment is largely uncertain as it is very difficult to pr\nedict future \nhappenings, especially when environment changes are taking place too frequently as in the case of information tech\n nology \nor fashion industries.\n (v i ) Complexity: Since business \nenv ironment consists of \nnumerous interrelated and dynamic conditions or forces which arise from different sources, it becomes difficult to comprehend at once what exactly constitutes a given environment. In other words, environment is a complex phenomenon that is relatively easier to understand in parts but difficult to grasp in its \nCh_03.indd   71 08-08-2022   09:37:32\nReprint 2024-25"

For example, it may \nbe difficult to know the extent of the relative impact of the social, economic, political, technological or legal factors on change in demand of a product in the market.\n(vii)\n Relativity: Business environment \nis a r\nelative concept since it \ndiffers from country to country and even region to region. Political conditions in the USA, for instance, differ from those in China or Pakistan. Similarly, demand for sarees may be fairly high in India whereas it may be almost non\n­existent in France.\niMportance  of Business  \nenvironMent\nJust like human beings, business \nenterprises do not exist in isolation. Each business firm is not an island unto itself; it exists, survives and grows within the context of the element and forces of its environment. While an individual  \nfirm is able to do little to change or control these forces, it has no alternative to responding or adapting according to them. A good understanding of environment by business managers enables them not only to identify and evaluate, but also to react to the forces external to their firms. The importance of business environment and its understanding by managers can be appreciated if we consider the following facts: (i) It enables the firm to identify \nopportunities and getting the first mover advantage: Opportunities refer to the positive exter\nnal trends or changes that  \nwill help a firm to improve its performance. Environment prov­ides numerous opportunities for business success. Early identi­fication of opportunities helps an enterprise to be the first to exploit them instead of losing them to competitors. For example, Maruti Udyog became the leader in the small car market because it was the first to recognise the need for small cars in an environment of rising petroleum prices and  \na large middle class population in India.\n (ii) It helps the firm to identify threats and early warning signals: Threats refer to the external environment tr\nends and \nchanges that will hinder a firm’s performance. Besides oppor­tunities, environment happens to be the source of many threats. Environmental awareness can help managers to identify various threats  on time and serve as an early warning signal. For example, if an Indian firm finds that a foreign multinational is entering the Indian market with new substitutes, it should act as a warning signal. On the basis of this information, the Indian firms can prepare themselves to meet the threat by adopting such \nCh_03.indd   72 08-08-2022   09:37:32\nReprint 2024-25"

To engage in any type of activity, a business enterprise assembles various resources called inputs like finance, machines, raw materials, power and water, labour, etc., from its environment including financiers, government and suppliers. They decide to provide these resources with their own expectations to get something in return from the enterprise. The business enterprise supplies the environment with its outputs such as goods and services for customers, payment of taxes to government, return on financial investment to investors and so on. Because the enterprise depends on the environment as a source of inputs or resources and as an outlet for outputs, it only makes sense that the enterprise designs policies that allow it to get the resources that it needs so that it can convert those resources into outputs that the environment desires. This can be done better by understanding what the environment has to offer. (iv) It helps in coping with rapid \nchanges: Today’s business envir­\nonment is getting increasingly dynamic where changes ar\ne \ntaking place at a fast pace. It is not the fact of change itself that is so important as the pace of change. Turbulent market conditions, less brand loyalty, divisions and sub\n­divisions (fragmentation) \nof markets, more demanding customers, rapid changes in technology and intense global competition ar\ne just a few of the \nimages used to describe today’s business environment. All sizes and all types of enterprises are facing increasingly dynamic environment. In order to eff­ectively cope with these signifi­cant changes, managers must understand and examine the environment and develop suit­able courses of action.\n (v) It helps in assisting in planning and policy formulation:   Since environment is a source of both opportunities and threats for a business enterprise, its understanding \nand analysis \ncan be the basis for deciding the future course of action (planning) or training guidelines for decision making (policy). For instance, entry of new players in the market, which means more competition may make an enterprise think afresh about how to deal with the situation.\nCh_03.indd   73 08-08-2022   09:37:32\nReprint 2024-25"

The answer is that it does appear to make a difference. Many studies reveal that the future of an enterprise is closely bound up with what is happening in the environment. And, the enter­prises that continuously monitor their environment and adopt suitable business practices are the ones which not only improve their present performance but also continue to succeed in the market for a longer period.\nDiMensions  of Business  \nenvironMent\nDimensions of, or the factors cons­\ntituting the business environment \ninclude economic, social, techno­logical, political and legal conditions which are considered relevant for decision\n­making and improving the \nperformance of an enterprise. In\n \ncontrast to the specific environment, these factors explain the general environment which mostly influences many enterprises at the same time. However, management of every enterprise can benefit from being aware of these dimensions instead of being disinterested in them. For instance, scientific research has discovered a technology that makes it possible to produce an energy efficient light bulb that lasts at least twenty times as long as a standard bulb. Senior managers in the lighting divisions at General Electric and Phillips recognised that this discovery had the potential to significantly affect their unit growth and profitability, So they have carefully followed the progress on this research and profitably used its findings. A brief discussion of the various factors constituting the general environment of business is given below:\n (i) Economic Environment: Int­erest rates, inflation rates,\n \nchanges in disposable income of people, stock market indices and the value of rupee are some of the economic factors that can affect management practices in a business enterprise. Short and long term interest rates significantly affect the demand for product and services. For example, in case of construction companies and automobile manufacturers, low longer\n­term rates are beneficial \nbecause they result in incr\neased \nspending by consumers for buying homes and cars on borrowed money. Similarly, a rise in the disposable income of people due to increase in the gross domestic product of a country creates increasing \ndemand for products. High  \ninflation rates generally result in constraints on business enterprises as they increase  \nCh_03.indd   74 08-08-2022   09:37:32\nReprint 2024-25"

At the same time, the government imposed several restrictions, regulations and controls on the working of private sector enterprises. India’s experience with economic planning has delivered mixed results. In 1991 the economy faced a serious foreign exchange crisis, high government deficit and a rising trend of prices despite bumper crops. \nAs a part of economic reforms, the \nGovernment of India announced a new industrial policy in July 1991. \nThe broad features of this policy \nwere as follows:(a)\n The Government reduced the number of industries under compulsory licensing to six.\n(b)\n Many of the industries reserved for the public sector under the earlier policy, were dereserved. The role of the public sector was limited only to four industries of strategic importance.\n(c)\n Disinvestment was carried out in case of many public sector industrial enterprises.\n(d)\n Policy towards foreign capital \nwas \nliberalised. The share of foreign equity participation was increased and in many activities 100 per cent Foreign Direct Investment \n(FDI) was permitted.\n(e)\n Automatic permission was now granted for technology agree\n ments \nwith foreign companies.\n(f) Foreign Investment Promotion Board (FIPB) was set up to promote and channelise for\neign \ninvestment in India.\nAppropriate measures were taken \nto remove obstacles in the way of growth and expansion of industrial units of large industrial houses. Small\n­scale sector was assured all \nhelp and accorded due recognition.\nIn essence, this policy has \nsought \nto liberate industry from the \nshackles of the licensing system (liberalisation), drastically reduce the role of the public sector (privatisation) and encourage foreign private participation in India’s industrial development (globalisation).\nLiberalisation: The economic reforms \nthat were introduced were aimed at liberalising the Indian business and industry from all unnecessary controls and restrictions. They signalled the end of the licence\n­pemit ­quota raj. \nLiberalisation of the Indian industry has taken place with respect to:\n (i) abolishing licensing requirement in most of the industries except a short list,\n (ii) freedom in deciding the scale of business activities i.e., no restrictions on expansion or\n \ncontraction of business activities,\n (iii) removal of restrictions on the movement of goods and services,\n (iv) freedom in fixing the prices \nof \ngoods services,\nCh_03.indd   82 08-08-2022   09:37:34\nReprint 2024-25"

The term disinvestments used here means transfer in the public sector enterprises to the private sector. It results in dilution of stake of the Government in the public enterprise. If there is dilution of Government ownership beyond 51 percent, it would result in transfer of ownership and management of the enterprise to the private sector.\nGlobalisation: Globalisation means \nthe integration of the various eco­nomies of the world leading towards the emergence of a cohesive global economy. Till 1991, the Government of India had followed a policy of strictly regulating imports in value and volume terms. These regulations were with respect to (a) licensing of \nimports, (b) tariff restrictions and (c) \nquantitative restrictions. The new economic reforms aimed at trade liberalisation were directed towards import liberalisation, export promotion through rationalisation of the tariff structure and reforms with respect to foreign exchange so that the country does not remain isolated from the rest of the world. Globalisation involves an increased level of interaction and interdependence among the various nations of the global economy. Physical geographical gap or political boundaries no longer remain barriers for a business enterprise to serve a customer in a distant geographical market. This has been made possible by the rapid advancement in technology and liberal trade policies by Governments. Through \nthe policy of 1991, the government of India moved the country to this globalisation pattern.\nActivity 3 \nGLOBALISATION\nMake a list of five Indian companies which have global operations today.

The two largest denomination notes, `500 `1,000, were ‘demonetised’ \nwith immediate effect, ceasing to be legal tender except for a few specified purposes such as paying utility bills. This led to eighty six per cent of the \nmoney in circulation invalid. The people of India had to deposit the invalid currency in the banks which came along with the restrictions placed on cash withdrawals. In other words, restrictions were placed on the convertibility of domestic money and bank deposits.\nThe aim of demonetisation was \nto curb corruption, counterfeiting \nthe use of high denomination notes for illegal activities; and especially the accumulation of ‘black money’ generated by income that has not been declared to the tax authorities.\nFeatures\n 1. Demonetisation is viewed as a tax \nadministration measure. Cash \nholdings arising from declar\ned \nincome was readily deposited in banks and exchanged for new notes. But those with black money had to declare their unaccounted wealth and pay taxes at a penalty rate.  2. Demonetisation is also \ninterpreted as a shift on the part of the government indicating that tax evasion will no longer be tolerated or accepted.\n 3. Demonetisation also led to tax administration channelizing savings into the formal financial system. Though, much of the cash that has been deposited in the banking system is bound to be withdrawn but some of the new deposits schemes offered by the banks will continue to pr\novide a base loans, at lower \ninterest rates.\n 4. Another  feature  of  demonetisation  \nis to create a less-cash or  \ncash-lite economy, i.e., channeling  \nmore savings through the formal financial system and improving tax compliance. Though there are arguments against this as digital transactions require use of cell phones for customers and Point\n­of­Sale (PoS) machines \nfor merchants, which will only  \nwork if there is inter\nnet \nconnectivity. On the contrary, these disadvantages are counterbalanced by an understanding that it helps people into the formal economy, thereby increasing financial \nsaving and reducing tax evasion. \nDigitalisation has broadly impact three sections of society: the poor, who are largely \noutside the digital economy; the less largely outside the digital economy; the less affluent, who are becoming part of the digital economy who have been covered under Jan Dhan Accounts and Rupay cards; and the affluent, who are fully conversant with digital transactions.\nCh_03.indd   86 08-08-2022   09:37:34\nReprint 2024-25"

Economic environment includes such factors as interest rates, inflation rates, changes in disposable income of people, stock market indexes and the value of rupee. Social environment includes social forces like traditions, values, social trends, society’s expectations of business, and so on. Technological environment includes forces relating to scientific improvements and innovations which provide new ways of producing goods and services and new methods and techniques of operating a business. Political environment includes political conditions such as general stability and peace in the country and specific attitudes that elected government representatives hold toward business. Legal environment includes various legislations passed by the government, administrative orders issued by government authorities, court judgments as well as decisions rendered by various commissions and agencies at every level of the government— center, state or local.Economic environment in India: The economic environment in India consists of various macro\n­level factors related to the means \nof production and distribution of wealth which have an impact on business and industry. The economic envir\nonment of business in \nIndia has been steadily changing since Independence mainly due to government policies. In order to solve economic problems of our country at the time of Independence, the government took several steps including control by the state of key industries, central planning and reduced importance of the private sector. These steps delivered mixed results until 1991 when Indian economy happened to face serious foreign exchange crisis, high government deficit and a rising trend of prices despite bumper crops.Liberalisation, privatisation and  globalisation: As a part of economic reforms, the Government of India announced a new industrial policy in July 1991 which sought to liberate the industry from the shackles of the licensing system (liberalisation), drastically reduce the role of the public sector (privatisation) and encourage foreign private participation in industrial development (globalisation).Impact of Government policy changes on business and industry: The government policy of liberalisation, privatisation and globalisation has made a definite impact on the working of enterprises in business and industry in terms of \nCh_03.indd   88 08-08-2022   09:37:34\nReprint 2024-25"

With over 34,000 strong work force, a Maharatna Company, Indian Oil has been helping to meet India’s energy demands and reaching petroleum products to every part of India for over five decades. It plans to increase its business operations all around the world. The company plans to invest ` 20,000 \ncrore in 2017-18 acquisitions and plans to expand overseas.

Of course, these are broad statements given by the company and they have to be broken down into steps for implementation. This is an example of a company with a nation‑wide reach striving to be one of the top companies in India. Further more, every organisation whether it is government\n‑owned, a privately \nowned business or a company in the private sector requires planning. \nThe \ngovernment makes five year plans for the country, a small business has it’s own plans, while other companies have big plans, sales plans, production plans. All of them have some plans.\nAll business firms would like to be \nsuccessful, increase their sales and \nearn profits. All managers dream of these and strive to achieve their goals. But to turn these dreams into reality managers need to work hard in thinking about the future, in making business predictions and achieving targets. Dreams can be turned into reality only if business managers think in advance on what to do and how to do it. This is the essence of planning. \nconcept\nPlanning is deciding in advance what \nto do and how to do. It is one of the basic managerial functions. Before doing something, the manager must formulate an idea of how to work on a particular task. Thus, planning is closely connected with creativity and innovation. But the manager would first have to set objectives, only then will a manager know where he has to go. Planning seeks to bridge the gap between where we are and where we want to go. Planning is what managers at all levels do. It requires taking decisions since it involves making a choice from alternative courses of action.\nPlanning, thus, involves setting \nobjectives and developing appropriate \ncourses of action to achieve these obj\n‑\nectives. Objectives provide direction for all managerial decisions and  actions. Planning provides a rational approach \nfor achieving predetermined \nobjectives. All  members, therefore, on a project basis IOC will certainly go into the market — both \nIndia and Overseas, depending on which is cheaper — to borrow money, if needed.\nSource: https://www.business-standard.com/article/companies/ioc-to-invest-around-rs-20-000-in-2017-18-plans-expansion-acquisitions-117051600438_1.html.\nCh_04.indd   92 08-08-2022   09:43:21\nReprint 2024-25"

Therefore, planning means setting objectives and targets and formulating an action plan to achieve them. It is concerned with both ends and means i.e., what is to be done and how it is to be done.\nThe plan that is developed has to \nhave a given time frame but time is a limited resource. It needs to be utilised judiciously. If time factor is not taken into consideration, conditions in the environment may change and all business plans may go waste. Planning will be a futile exercise if it is not acted upon or implemented.\nDo you think from the above we \ncan formulate a comprehensive definition of planning? One of the \nways to do so would be to define planning as setting objectives for a given time period, formulating various courses of action to achieve them, and then selecting the best possible alternative from among the various courses of  \naction available.\nImportance  of  plannIng\nYou must have seen in films and advertisements how executives draw up plans and make powerful presentations in boardrooms. Do those plans actually work? Does it improve efficiency? After all why should we plan? These are numerous questions to which we would like to find solutions. Planning is certainly important as it tells us where to go, it provides direction and reduces the risk of uncertainty by preparing forecasts. The major benefits of planning are given below:\n (i) Planning provides directions:  \nBy stating in advance how work is to be done planning provides direction for action. Planning ens\n ures that the goals \nor objectives are clearly stated so that they act as a guide for deciding what action should be\n \ntaken and in which direction. If goals are well defined, employees are aware of what the organisation has to do and what they must do to achieve those goals.

If there was no planning, empl\n‑\noyees would be working in \ndifferent directions and the or\nganisation would not be able \nto achieve its desired goals.\n (ii) Planning reduces the risks of \nuncertainty: Planning is an activity which enables a manager to look ahead and anticipate changes.\n \nBy deciding in advance the tasks to be performed, planning shows the way to deal with changes and uncertain events. Changes or events cannot be eliminated but they can be anticipated and managerial responses to them can be developed.\n (iii) Planning reduces overlapping and wasteful activities: Planning serves as the \nbasis of coordinating \nthe activities and efforts of different divisions, departments and individuals. It helps in avoiding confusion and misunderstanding. Since planning  ensures clarity in thought and action, work is carried on smoothly without interruptions. Useless and redundant activities are minimised or eliminated. It is easier to detect inefficiencies and take corrective measures to deal with them.\n (iv) Planning promotes innovative ideas: Since planning is the first function of management, new ideas can take the shape of concrete plans. It is the most challenging activity for the management as it guides all future actions leading to growth \nand pr\nosperity of the business. \n (v) Planning facilitates decision making: Planning helps the manager to look into the futur\ne and make a choice from \namongst various alternative courses of action. The manager has to evaluate each alternative and select the most viable proposition. Planning involves setting targets and predicting future conditions, thus helping in taking rational decisions.\n (vi) Planning establishes standards for controlling:  Planning \ninvolves setting of goals. The \nentire managerial pr\nocess is \nconcerned with accomplishing predeter\n mined g\noals through \nplanning, organising, staffing, directing and controlling. Planning provides the goals or standards against which actual performance is measured. By comparing actual performance with some standard, managers can know whether they have actually been able to attain the goals. If there is any deviation it can be corrected. Therefore, we can say that planning is a prerequisite for controlling. If there were no goals and standards, then finding deviations which are a \nCh_04.indd   94 08-08-2022   09:43:23\nReprint 2024-25"

Therefore, planning provides the basis of control.\nfeatures  of plannIng  \nIn the example of Polaris, the company has plans of expansion. Their objective is to increase their capacity so that they can employ 800 more professionals. Their target time is six months. The objective of the current year has also been clearly stated which is to increase capacity by 1500\n‑2000 more professionals. \nSince planning is the primary function of management they have set their objectives first. Thus, all businesses follow a set pattern of planning. You will be able to find some similarities in the featur\nes of \nplanning and what you see in real life. Try and identify them.\nThe planning function of the \nmanagement has certain special features. These features throw light on its nature and scope.\n (i) Planning focuses on achieving \nobjectives: Organisations are set up with a general purpose in view. Specific \ngoals are set \nout in the plans along with the activities to be undertaken to achieve the goals. Thus, planning is purposeful. Planning has no meaning unless it contributes to the achievement \nof predetermined organisational goals.\n (ii) Planning is a primary function of management: Planning lays  \ndown the base for other functions of management. All\n \nother managerial functions are performed within the framework of the plans drawn. Thus, planning precedes other functions. This is also referred to as the primacy of planning. The various functions of management are interrelated and equally important. However, planning provides the basis of all other functions.\n (iii) Planning is pervasive: Planning is required at all levels of \nmanagement as well as in all\n \ndepartments of the organisation. It is not an exclusive function of top management nor of any particular department. But the scope of planning differs at different levels and among different departments. For example, the top management undertakes planning for the organisation as a whole. Middle management does the departmental planning. At the lowest level, day\n‑to‑day \noperational planning is done by supervisors.\n (iv) Planning is continuous: Plans are prepared for a specific period of time, may be for a month, a quarter, or a year\n.

Hence, planning is a continuous process. Continuity of planning is related with the planning cycle. It means that a plan is framed, it is implemented, and is followed by another plan, and so on.\n (v) Planning is futuristic: Planning essentially involves looking ahead and preparing for the\n \nfuture. The purpose of planning is to meet future events effectively to the best advantage of an organisation. It implies peeping into the future, analysing it and predicting it. Planning is, therefore, regarded as a forward looking function based on forecasting. Through forecasting, future events and conditions are anticipated and plans are drawn accordingly. Thus, for example, sales forecasting is the basis on which a business firm prepares its annual plan for production and sales.\n (vi) Planning involves decision making: Planning essentially inv\n olves choice from among \nvari\nous alternatives and \nactivities. If there is only one possible goal or a possible course of action, there is no need for planning because there is no choice. The need for planning arises only when alternatives are available. In actual practice, planning presupposes the existence of alternatives. Planning, thus, involves thorough examination and evaluation of each alternative and choosing the most appropriate one.\n (vii) Planning is a mental exercise:  \nPlanning requires application of the mind involving foresight,\n \nintelligent imagination and sound judgement. It is basically an intellectual activity of thinking rather than doing, because planning determines the action to be taken. However, planning requires logical and systematic thinking rather than guess work or wishful thinking. \nPlanning: the first \nstep to management\nCh_04.indd   96 08-08-2022   09:43:24\nReprint 2024-25"

It is difficult to manage operations  without formal planning. It is important for an organisation to move towards achieving goals. But we have often seen in our daily lives also, that things do not always go according to plan. Unforeseen events and changes, rise in costs and prices, environmental changes, government interventions, legal regulations, all affect our business plans. Plans then need to be modified. If we cannot adhere to our plans, then why do we plan at all? This is what we need to analyse. The major limitations of planning are given below:\n (i) Planning leads to rigidity: In \nan organisation, a well ‑defined \nplan is drawn up with specific \ngoals to be achieved within a specific time frame. These plans then decide the \nfuture \ncourse of action and managers may not be in a position to change it. This kind of rigidity in plans may create difficulty. Managers need to be given some flexibility to be able to cope with the changed circumstances. Following a pre\n‑decided plan, \nwhen circum  stances have \nchanged, may not turn out to be in the organisations interest.\n (ii) Planning may not work in a  \ndynamic environment: The business environment is \ndynamic, nothing is constant. The environment consists of a number of dimensions, economic, political, physical, legal and social dimensions. The organisation has to constantly adapt itself to changes. It becomes difficult to accurately  assess future trends in the environment if economic policies are modified or political conditions in the country are not stable or there is a natural   calamity. Competition in the market can also upset financial plans, sales targets may have to be revised and, accordingly, cash budgets also need to be modified since they are based on sales figures. Planning \ncannot foresee everything and thus, there may be obstacles to effective planning.\n (iii) Planning reduces creativity: Planning is an activity which is done by the top management. Usually the rest of \nthe members \njust implements these plans. As a consequence, middle \nmanagement and other decision \nCh_04.indd   97 08-08-2022   09:43:24\nReprint 2024-25"

Any plan needs to be translated into action or it becomes meaningless. Mana\n gers have a \ntendency to rely on previously\n \ntried and tested successful plans. It is not always true that just because a plan has worked before it will work again. Besides, there are so many other unknown factors to be considered. This kind of complacency and false sense of security may act\n ually lead \nto failure instead of success. However, despite its limitations, planning is not a useless\n \nexercise. It is a tool to be used with caution. It provides a base for analysing future courses of action. But, it is not a solution to all problems. \nplannIng  process\nPlanning, as we all know is deciding in advance what to do and how to do. It is a process of decision making. How do we go about making a plan? Since planning is an activity there are certain logical steps for every manager to follow.\n (i) Setting Objectives: The first  \nand foremost step is setting objectives. Every or\nganisation makers are neither allowed to \ndeviate from plans nor are they permitted to act on their own. Thus, much of the initiative or creativity inherent in them also gets lost or reduced. Most of the time, employees do not even attempt to formulate plans. They only carry out orders. Thus, planning in a way reduces creativity since people tend to think along the same lines as others. There is nothing new or innovative.\n (iv) Planning involves huge costs: When plans are drawn \nup huge  \ncosts are involved in their formulation. These may be in terms of time and money for example, checking accuracy of facts may involve lot of time. Detailed plans require scientific calculations to ascertain facts and figures. The costs incurred sometimes may not justify the benefits derived from the plans. There are a number of incidental costs as well, like expenses on boardroom meetings, discussions with professional experts and preliminary investigations to find out the viability of the plan.\n (v) Planning is a time-consuming process: Sometimes plans to be drawn up take so much of time that ther\ne is not much time left \nfor their implementation.\nCh_04.indd   98 08-08-2022   09:43:24\nReprint 2024-25"

Objectives or goals specify what the organisation wants to achieve. It could mean an increase in sales by 20% which could be objective of the entire organisation. How all dep\n artments would contribute \nto the organisational goals is the plan that is to be drawn up. Objectives should be stated clearly for all departments, units and employees. They give direction to all departments. Departments/units then need to set their own objectives within the br\n oad \nframework of the organisation’s philosophy. Objectives have to percolate down to each unit and employees at all levels. At the same time, managers must \ncontribute ideas and participate in the objective setting process. They must also understand how their actions contribute to achieving objectives. If the end result is clear it becomes easier to work towards the goal.\n (ii) Developing Premises: Planning is concerned with the future which is uncertain and every\n \nplanner is using conjecture about  \nwhat might happen in future. \nDuring the devastating earthquake of January 2001, Mansukhbhai incurred heavy \nloss and most of his goods were damaged. He distributed the leftover stock that was undamaged, to the quake affected masses of Kutch. This led to a photograph that was taken just after the earthquake and featured on the Sandesh Gujarati Daily in February 2001. It showed a broken water filter that was made by Mansukhbhai with a caption that said “The poor man’s broken fridge”. \nAt that time, he met the Gujarat Grass-roots Innovation Augmentation Network \n(GIAN), Ahmedabad, which supported Mansukhbhai further in his endeavours. Finally after an arduous quest and several tests of soil and fridge designs, he emerged with the innovative Mitticool fridge in 2005. After that he has innovated various products using clay. \n yThe company has stuck to its \npolicy of keeping all its products at a lower rate \nwhich will be affordable for the poor people.\n yTheir future plans include starting a factory with the \naid of the National Innovation \nFoundation at IIM Ahmedabad and making a MittiCool house. It will be a green (eco-friendly) house with clay that will have no electricity but only renewable energy to maintain a comfortable temperature inside.”Kinds of plans: Objective, Strategy and Policy of Mitticool\nCh_04.indd   99 08-08-2022   09:43:24\nReprint 2024-25"

Assumptions are the base material upon which plans are to be drawn. The base material may be in the form of forecasts, existing plans or any past information about policies. The premises or assumptions must be the same for all and there should be total agreement on them. All managers involved in planning should be familiar with and use the same assumptions. For example, forecasting is important in developing premises as it is a technique of gathering information. Forecasts can be made about the demand for a particular product, policy change, interest rates, prices of capital goods, tax rates etc. Accurate forecasts, therefore become essential for successful plans.\n (iii) Identifying alternative courses  \nof action: Once objectives are set,\n \nassumptions are made. Then the \nnext step would be to act upon them. There may be many ways to act and achieve objectives. All the alternative courses of action should be identified. The course of action which may be taken could be either routine or innovative. An innovative course may be adopted by involving more people and sharing their ideas. If the project is important, then more alternatives should be generated and thoroughly \ndiscussed amongst the members of the organisation.\n (iv) Evaluating alternative courses: The next step is to weigh the pros and cons of each alternative. Each course will have many variables\n \nwhich have to be weighed against each other. The positive and negative aspects of each proposal need to be evaluated in the light of the objective to be achieved. In financial plans, for example, the risk\n‑return \ntrade ‑off is very common. The \nmore risky the investment, the higher the r\neturns it is \nlikely to give. To evaluate such proposals detailed calculations of earnings, earnings per share, interest, taxes, dividends are made and decisions taken. Accurate forecasts in conditions of certainty/uncertainty then become vital assumptions for these proposals. Alternatives are evaluated in the light of their feasibility and consequences.\n (v) Selecting an alternative: This is \nthe real point \nof decision making. \nThe best plan has to be adopted and implemented. The ideal plan, of course, would be the most feasible, profitable and with least negative conseq\n uences. \nMost plans may not always be subjected to a mathematical analysis. In such cases, subjectivity and the manager’s exp\n erience, judgement and \nCh_04.indd   100 08-08-2022   09:43:24\nReprint 2024-25"

Sometimes, a combination of plans may be selected instead of one best course. The manager will have to apply permutations and combinations and select the best possible course of action.\n (vi) Implementing the plan: This is the step where other managerial functions also come into the picture. The step is concer\nned \nwith putting the plan into action, i.e., doing what is required. For example, if there is a plan to increase production then more labour, more machinery will be required. This step would also involve organising for labour and purchase of machinery.\n (vii) Follow-up action: To see whether \nplans are being implemented and activities ar\ne performed according \nto schedule is also part of the planning process. Monitoring the plans is equally important to ensure that objectives are achieved.\ntypes of plans\nSingle-use and standing plans \nAn organisation has to prepare a plan \nbefore making any decision related to business operation, or undertaking any project. Plans can be classified into several types depending on the use and the length of the planning period. Certain plans have a short\n‑\nterm horizon and help to achieve operational goals. These plans can be \nclassified into single ‑use plans and \nstanding plans.Single-use Plan: A single\n‑use plan \nis developed for a one ‑time event or  \nproject. Such a course of action is not likely to be r\nepeated in future, i.e., \nthey are for non ‑recurring situations. \nThe duration of this plan may depend upon the type of the project. It may\n \nspan a week or a month. A project may sometimes be of only one day, such as, organising an event or a seminar or conference. These plans include budgets, programmes and projects. They consist of details, including the names of employees who are responsible for doing the work and contributing to the single\n‑use plan. For \nexample, a programme \nmay consist of \nidentifying steps, procedures required for opening a new department to deal with other minor work. Projects are similar to programmes but differ in scope and complexity. A budget is a statement of  expenses, revenue and income for a specified period.  Standing Plan: A standing plan is used for activities that occur regularly over a period of time. It is designed to ensure that internal operations of an organisation run smoothly. Such a plan greatly enhances efficiency in routine decision\n‑making. It is usually \ndeveloped once but is modified \nfrom \ntime to time to meet business needs as required. Standing plans include policies, procedures, methods and rules. \nPolicies are general forms of standing \nplans that specifies the organisations \nCh_04.indd   101 08-08-2022   09:43:24\nReprint 2024-25"

Procedures describe steps to be followed in particular circumstances like the procedure for reporting progress in production. Methods provide the manner in which a task has to be performed. Rules are very clearly stated as to exactly what has to be done like reporting for work at a particular time.\nSingle\n‑use and standing plans \nare part of the operational planning process.\n \nThere are other types of plans which \nusually are not classified as single ‑ \nuse or standing plans. A strategy, for example, is part of strategic planning or management. It is a general plan prepared by \ntop management \noutlining resource allocation, priorities and takes into consideration the business environment and competition. Objectives are usually set by the top management and serve as a guide for overall planning. Each unit then formulates their own objectives keeping in view the overall organisational goals.  \nBased on what the plans seek to \nachieve, plans can be classified as Objectives, Strategy, Policy, Procedure, Method, Rule, Programme, Budget.\nobjectIves\nThe first step in planning is setting \nobjectives. Objectives, therefore, can be said to be the desired future position that the management would like to reach. Objectives are very basic to the organisation and they are defined as ends which the management seeks to achieve by its operations. Therefore, an objective simply stated is what you would like to achieve, i.e., the end result of activities. For example, an organisation may have an objective of increasing sales by 10% or earning a reasonable rate of return on investment, earn a 20% profit from business. They represent the end point of planning. All other managerial activities are also directed towards achieving these objectives. They are usually set by top management of the organisation and focus on broad, general issues. They define the future state of affairs which the organisation strives to realise. They serve as a guide for overall business planning. Different departments or units in the organisation may have their own objectives. \nObjectives need to be expressed  \nin specific terms i.e., they should be \nmeasurable in quantitative terms, in the form of a written statement of desired results to be achieved within a given time period.\nstrategy  \nA strategy provides the broad contours \nof an organisation’s business. It will also refer to future decisions defining the organisations direction and scope in the long run. Thus, we can say a strategy is a comprehensive plan \nCh_04.indd   102 08-08-2022   09:43:24\nReprint 2024-25"

This comprehensive plan  \nwill include three dimensions,  \n(i) determining long term objectives, (ii) adopting a particular course of action, and  (iii) allocating resources necessary to achieve the objective.\nWhenever a strategy is formulated, \nthe business environment needs to be taken into consideration. The changes in the economic, political, social, legal and technological environment will affect an organisation’s strategy. Strategies usually take the course of forming the organisation’s identity in the business enviro\n‑\nnment. Major strategic decisions will include decisions like whether the organisation will continue to be in the same line of business, or combine new lines of activity with the existing business or seek to acquire a dominant position in the same market. For example, a company’s marketing strategy has to address certain questions i.e., who are the customers? what is the demand \nfor the product? which \nchannel of distribution to use? what is the pricing policy? and how do we advertise the product. These and many more issues need to be resolved while formulating a marketing strategy for any organisation.  \npolIcy\nPolicies are general statements that guide thinking or channelise  energies towards a particular direction. Policies provide a basis for interpreting strategy which is usually stated in general terms. They are guides to managerial action \nand decisions in the implementation of strategy. For example, the company may have a recruitment policy, pricing policy within which objectives are set and decisions are made. If there is an established  policy, it becomes easier to resolve problems or issues. As such, a policy is the general response to a particular problem or situation. \nThere are policies for all levels \nand departments in the organisation \nranging from major company policies to minor policies. Major company policies are for all to know i.e., customers, clients, competitors etc., whereas minor polices are applicable to insiders and contain minute details of information vital to the employees of an organisation. But there has to be some basis for divulging information to others. \nPolicies define the broad \nparameters within which a manager may function. The manager may use his/her discretion to interpret and apply a policy. For example, the decisions taken under a Purchase Policy would be in the nature of manufacturing or buying decisions. Should a company make or buy its requirements of packages, transport services, printing of stationery, water and power supply and other items? How should vendors be selected for procuring supplies? How many suppliers should a company make purchases from? What is the criteria for choosing suppliers. All these \nCh_04.indd   103 08-08-2022   09:43:24\nReprint 2024-25"

They detail  \nthe exact manner in which any  \nwork is to be performed. They are  \nspecified in a chronological order. For  \nexample, there may be a procedure for  \nrequisi  tioning supplies before \nproduction. Procedures are specified \nsteps to be followed in particular cir\ncumstances. They  are generally \nmeant for insiders to follow. The sequence of steps or actions to be taken are generally to enforce a policy and to attain pre\n‑determined \nobjectives.

Selection of proper method saves time, money and effort and increases efficiency. For imparting training to employees at various level from top management to supervisory, different methods can be adopted. For example for higher level management orientation programmes, lectures and seminars \ncan be organised whereas at the supervisory level, on the job training methods and work\n‑oriented  methods \nare appropriate. \nrule\nRules are specific statements that inform what is to be done. They do not allow for any flexibility or discretion. It reflects a managerial decision that  \na certain action must or must not be taken.

Programmes will include the entire gamut of activities as well as the organisation’s policy and how it will contribute to the overall business plan.

A budget may also be prepared to show the number of workers required in the factory at peak production times.\nSince budget represents all items \nin numbers, it becomes easier to \ncompare actual figures with expected figures and take corrective action subsequently. Thus, a budget is also a control device from which deviations can be taken care of. But making a budget involves forecasting, therefore, it clearly comes under planning. It is a fundamental planning instrument in many organisations. \nLet us take an example of Cash \nBudget. The cash budget is a basic tool in the management of cash. It is a device to help the management to \nplan and control the use of cash. It is a statement showing the estimated cash inflows and cash outflows over a given period. Cash inflows would generally come from cash sales and the cash outflows would gener\n ally be \nthe costs and expenses associated with the operations of the business. The net cash position is determined by the cash budget i.e., inflows minus\n \n(–) outflows = surplus or deficiency.\nThe management has to hold \nadequate cash balances for various purposes. But at the same time, it should avoid excess balance of cash since it gives little or no return. The business has to assess and plan its need for cash with a degree  \nof caution. \nPlanning   Objectives   Goals   Decisions\nStandards   Controlling   Premises   Assumptions\nAlternatives   Strategy   Policy   Procedure\nRule  Programme   BudgetKey Terms\nSummary\nPlanning\nPlanning is deciding in advance what to do and how to do.

It also modified the relationships within the management hierarchy to suit the goals.\nThe management function of \norganising ensures that efforts are directed towards the attainment of goals laid down in the planning function in such a manner that resources are used optimally and people are able to work collectively and effectively for a common purpose. Thus, it is in the context of effective management that the organisation function earns due importance. It is a means for translating plans into action.The organising function leads to the \ncreation of an organisational structure \nwhich includes the designing of roles to be filled by suitably skilled people and defining the inter relationship between these roles so that ambi­guity in performance of duties can be eliminated.

The whole activity is divided into task groups each dealing with a specific area like the food committee, the decoration committee, the ticketing committee and so on. These are under the overall supervision of the official in charge of the event. Coordinating relationships are established among the various groups to enable smooth interaction and clarity about each group’s contribution towards the event.

Let us try and understand how organising is carried out with the help of an example.\nSuppose twelve students work for \nthe school library in the summer vacations. One afternoon they are told to unload a shipment of new releases, stock the bookshelves, and then dispose of all waste (packaging, paper etc). If all the students decide to do it in their own way, it will result in mass confusion. However, if one student supervises the work by grouping students, dividing the work, assigning each group their quota and developing reporting relationships among them, the job will be done faster and in a better manner.\nFrom the above description, the \nfollowing steps emerge in the process of organising:\n (i) Identification and division of work: The first step in \nthe \nprocess of organising involves identifying and dividing the work that has to be done in accordance with previously determined plans. The work is divided into manageable activities so that duplication can be avoided and the burden of work can be shared among the employees.  \n (ii) Departmentalisation: Once \nwork has been divided into small \nand manageable activities then \nthose activities \n which are similar \nin nature are grouped together.

Examples of some of the most popularly used basis are territory (north, south, west, etc.) and products (appliances, clothes, cosmetics etc).\n (iii) Assignment of duties: It is \nnecessary to define the work of different job positions and accordingly allocate work to various employees. Once departments have \nbeen formed, \neach of them is placed under the charge of an individual.  Jobs are then allocated to the members of each department in accordance to their skills and competencies. It is essential for effective performance that a proper match is made between \nthe nature of a job and the ability of an individual. The work must be assigned to those who are best fitted to perform it well.\n (iv) Establishing authority and \nreporting relationships: Merely allocating work is not enough.

This removes ambiguity in transfer of information and instructions. It helps in creating a hierarchical order thereby enabling the fixation of responsibility and specification of the extent of authority to be exercised  by an individual. \n (iii) Optimum utilisation of resources: Organising leads to the proper usage of all material, fin\n ancial and human resources. \nThe pr\noper assignment of jobs \navoids overlapping of work and also makes possible the best use of resources. Avoidance of duplication of work helps in preventing confusion and minimising the wastage of resources and efforts. \n (iv) Adaptation to change: The process of organising allows a business enterprise to accommodate changes in the business environment. \nIt allows \nthe organisation structure to be suitably modified and the revision of inter\n­relationships amongst \nmanagerial levels to pave the way for a smooth transition. It also provides much needed stability to the enterprise as it can then continue to survive and grow inspite of changes.\n (v) Effective administration:  \nOrganising provides a clear\n \ndescription of jobs and related duties. This helps to avoid confusion and duplication. Clarity in working relationships enables proper execution of work. Management of an enterprise thereby becomes easy and this brings effectiveness in administration.\n (vi) Development of personnel:\nOrganising stimulates creativity amongst the managers.  Effective delegation allows \nthe managers \nto reduce their workload  by assigning routine jobs to their subordinates.  The  reduction in  \nworkload by delegation is not just necessary because of limited capacity of an individual but also allows the manager to develop new methods and ways of performing tasks. It gives them the time to explore areas for growth and the opportunity to innovate thereby strengthening the company’s competitive position.  Delegation also develops in the subordinate the ability to deal effectively with challenges and helps them to  realise their full potential.\n (vii) Expansion and growth: Organ­ising helps in the growth  and diversification of an \nenterprise  \nCh_05.indd   113 08-08-2022   09:50:36\nReprint 2024-25"

An effective structure will result in increased profitability of the enterprise. The need for an adequate organisation structure is felt by \nan enterprise whenever it grows in size or complexity. It is only those enterprises which do not focus on growth that can maintain a particular structure for a long period of time. However, it is important to understand that such stagnancy may prove to be detrimental to an enterprise as those companies \nwhich do not change at all will close down or cease to grow.\nAs an organisation grows, coordi­\nnation becomes difficult due to the emergence of new functions and increase in structural hierarchies. Thus, for an organisation to function smoothly and face environmental changes, it becomes necessary to pay attention to its structure.\nPeter Drucker emphasises on the \nimportance of having an appropriate organisation structure when he says, “organisation structure is an indispensable means; and the wrong structure will seriously impair busi­ness performance and even destroy it.”\nThe organisation structure can \nbe defined as the framework within which managerial and operating tasks are performed. It specifies the relationships between people, work and resources. It allows correlation \nand coordination among human, physical  and financial resources  and this enables a business enterprise to accomplish desired goals. The organisation structure of a firm is shown in an organisation chart.\nThe span of management, to \na large extent gives shape to the Organising leads to specialisation in work.

For example, in a manufacturing concern division of work into key functions will include production, purchase, marketing, accounts and personnel. These departments may be further divided into sections. Thus, a functional structure is an organisational design that groups similar or related jobs together.Advantages: The functional structure has many advantages to offer. Important among them are as follows:(a)\n A functional structure leads to occupational specialisation since emphasis is placed on specific functions. This promotes ef\nficiency \nin utilisation of manpower as employees perform similar tasks within a department and are able to improve performance.\n(b)\n It promotes control and coordination within a department because of similarity in the tasks being performed.\n(c)\n It helps in increasing managerial and operational efficiency  and this results in increased profit.\n(d)\n It leads to minimal duplication of effort which results in economies of scale and this lowers cost.\n(e)\n It makes training of  employees easier as the focus is only on a limited range of  skills.\n(f)\n It ensures that different functions get due attention.Disadvantages: The functional \nstructure \nhas certain disadvantages \nwhich an organisation must take into consideration before it adopts it. Some of them are as follows:\n(a)\n  A functional structure places less emphasis on overall enterprise\n \nobjectives than the objectives pursued by a functional head.  Such practices may lead to functional empires wherein the importance of a particular function may be overemphasised. Pursuing departmental interests at the cost of organisational interests can also hinder the interaction between two or more departments.\n(b)\n  It may lead to problems in coordination as information has to be exchanged across functionally differentiated departments.\n(c)  A conflict of interests may arise when the inter\nests of two \nor more departments are not compatible. For example, the sales department insisting on a customer friendly design may cause difficulties in production. Such dissension can prove to be harmful in terms of fulfillment of organisational interest. Inter\n­\ndepartmental conflicts can also arise in the absence of  clear separation of r\nesponsibility.\n(d)  It may lead to inflexibility as people with same skills and knowledge base may develop a narrow perspective and thus, \nCh_05.indd   116 08-08-2022   09:50:36\nReprint 2024-25"

Functional heads do not get training for top \nmanagement positions because they are unable to gather experience in diverse areas.\nSuitability: It is most suitable when the size of the organisation is large, has a diversified activities and operations require a high degree of specialisation.\nDivisional Structure\nMany large organisations with diversified activities have reorganised themselves away from the simpler and basic functional structure towards a divisional structure which is more suited to their activities. This is particularly true of those enterprises which have more than one category of products to offer. This is because although every organisation performs a set of homogenous functions, as it diversifies into varied product categories, the need for a more evolved  structural design is felt to cope with the emerging complexity. \nIn a divisional structure, the \norganisation structure comprises of separate business units or divisions. Each unit has a divisional manager \nresponsible for performance and who has authority over the unit. Generally, manpower is grouped on the basis of different products manufactured. Each division is multifunctional because within each division functions like production, marketing, finance, purchase, etc., are performed together to achieve a common goal. Each division is  \nself\n­contained as it develops expertise \nin all functions related to a product line.\nIn other words, within each division, \nthe functional structure tends to be \nadopted. However, functions may vary \nacross divisions in accordance with a particular product line. Further, each division works as a profit center where the divisional head is responsible for the profit or loss of his division.

To enable smooth functioning of the enterprise, job description and rules and procedures related to work processes have to be laid down.

It specifies clearly the boundaries of \nauthority and responsibility and Since its inception, ONGC has been instrumental in transforming the country’s limited \nupstream sector into a large viable playing field, with its activities spread throughout India and significantly in overseas territories.\nThe 1990s had begun on a grim note for ONGC. It took almost a decade for the Corporation \nto sort things out in most uncertain of times.\nAmong many problems, the Corporation was also suffering from the organisational atrophy.\nIn order to survive ONGC sought help from Mc Kinsey.\nMc Kinsey’s mandate was to evolve an organisational structure that was far more \nresponsive to its business needs than that based on business groups. The ONGC  system run by functional heads often meant delays exceeding a year in matters requiring urgent decisions on fields. Also, since responsibilities were shared at production platforms between different business groups, the system degenerated into wrangling over responsibilities. Similarly, group loyalties often took precedence over the requirements of tasks. But, most importantly, it was found that the performance evaluation criteria based on business group yardstick were completely at loggerheads with requirements on fields. Mc Kinsey recommended an asset-based approach with clearly-defined responsibilities in its presentation titled ‘Organisation T ransformation Project’\nThough Mc Kinsey recommendations were broadly accepted, coordination issues \nconcerning commonly-shared services needed to be sorted out. \nFinally, the first control over all service personnel working with asset teams was vested \nin asset managers, on grounds that being responsible for the performance of their strategic business units they must rightfully exercise control over all personnel working with them. Even procurement powers were devolved. Finally, a new structure made up of 14 assets and 11 centralised services was rolled out .Structural T ransformation at ONGC\nYou have seen the structure of ONGC as an illustration in this text.

Thus, irrespective of the extent of delegated authority ,the manager  shall still  be accountable to the same extent as \nbefore delegation.\nDelegation is the process a manager follows in dividing the work assigned to him so that he performs that part which only he because  of his unique organisational placement, can perform  effectively and so that he can get others to help with what remains.\nLouis Allen\nDelegation of authority merely means the granting of authority to subordinates to operate within prescribed limits.\nTheo HaimmanDelegation\nCh_05.indd   125 08-08-2022   09:50:37\nReprint 2024-25"

The concept of authority arises from the established scalar \nchain which \nlinks the various job positions \nand levels of an organisation. Authority also refers to the right to take decisions inherent in a \nmanagerial position to tell people what to do and expect them to do it.  \nIn the formal organisation authority \noriginates by virtue of an individual’s \nposition and the extent of authority is highest at the top management levels and reduces successively as we go down the corporate ladder. Thus, \nauthority flows from top to bottom, \nCh_05.indd   126 08-08-2022   09:50:39\nReprint 2024-25"

The extent to which a superior can exact compliance also depends on the personality of the superior.It must be noted that authority \nis restricted by laws and the rules \nand regulation of the organisation, which limit its scope. However, as we go higher up in the management  hierarchy, the scope of authority increases.\n (ii) Responsibility: Responsibility is the obligation of a subor\n­dinate \nto properly perform the assigned\n \nduty. It arises from a superior–subordinate relationship because the subor\n­dinate is bound to \nperform the duty assigned to him by his superior\n. Thus, \nresponsibility flows upwards, i.e., a subordinate will always be responsible to his superior.\nCreation of accountability for \nperformance\nCh_05.indd   127 08-08-2022   09:50:40\nReprint 2024-25"

Thus, for effective delegation the authority granted must be commensurate with the assigned responsibility. If authority granted is more than responsibility, it may lead to misuse of authority, and if responsibility assigned is more than authority it may make a person ineffective.\n (iii) Accountability: Delegation of \nauthority, undoubtedly empowers an employee to \nact for his superior \nbut the superior would still be accountable for the outcome:\nAccountability implies being \nanswerable for the final outcome. Once authority has been delegated \nand responsibility accepted, one cannot deny accountability. It cannot be delegated and flows upwards, i.e., a subordinate will be accountable to a superior for satisfactory performance \nof work. It indicates that the manager has to ensure the proper discharge of duties by his subordinates. It is generally enforced through regular feedback on the extent of work accomplished. The subordinate will be expected to explain the consequences of his actions or omissions. \nIn conclusion, it can be stated that  \nwhile authority is delegated, responsi­bility is assumed, accountability is imposed.

Effective delegation leads to \nthe following benefits:\n (i) Effective management: By \nempowering the employees, the managers are able to function\n \nmore efficiently as they get more time to concentrate on  important matters. Freedom from doing routine work provides them with opportunities to excel in new areas.\n (ii) Employee development: As a result of delegation, employees get more opportunitiecs \nto utilise \ntheir talent and this may give rise to latent abilities in them. It allows them to develop those skills which will enable them to perform complex tasks and assume those responsibilities which will improve their career prospects. It makes them better leaders and decision makers. Thus, delegation helps by preparing better future managers. Delegation empowers the employees by providing them with the chance to use their skills, gain experience and develop themselves for higher positions. \n (iii) Motivation of employees: Delegation helps in developing the talents of the employees. It als\no has psychological benefits. \nWhen a superior entrusts a \nsubordinate with a task, it is not merely the sharing of work but involves trust on the superior’s part and commitment on the part of the subordinate. Responsibility for work builds \nthe self\n­esteem of an employee \nand impr\noves his confidence. \nHe feels encouraged and tries to improve his performance further.\n (iv) Facilitation of growth: Delegation helps in the expansion of an organisation by providing a r\neady \nworkforce to take up leading positions in new ventures. Trained and experienced employees are able to play significant roles in the launch of new projects by replicating the work ethos they have absorbed from existing units, in the newly set up branches.\n (v) Basis of management hier­archy: Delegation of author \nity \nestablishes superior ­subordinate \nrelationships, which \nare the basis \nof hierarchy of management. It is the degree and flow of authority which determines who has to report to whom. The extent of delegated authority also decides the power that each job position enjoys in the organisation.\n (vi) Better coordina\ntion: The \nelements of delegation, namely authority, responsibility and accountability help to define the powers, duties and answerability related to the various positions in an organisation. This helps to \navoid overlapping of duties and duplication of effort as it gives a clear picture of the work being \nCh_05.indd   129 08-08-2022   09:50:40\nReprint 2024-25"

Such clarity \nin reporting relationships help in developing and maintaining effective coordination amongst the departments, levels and functions of management.\nThus, delegation is a key element \nin effective organising.\ndecentraliSation\nIn many organisations the top \nmanagement  plays an active role \nin taking all decisions while there are others in which this power is given to even the lower levels of management. Those organisations in which decision making authority lies with the top management are termed as  centralised organisations \nwhereas those in which such authority is shared with lower levels are decentralised organisations.\nDecentralisation explains the \nmanner in which decision making \nresponsibilities are divided among hierarchical levels. Put simply, decentralisation refers to delegation \nof authority throughout all the levels of the organisation. Decision making \nauthority is shared with lower levels \nand is consequently placed nearest to the points of action. In other words decision making authority is pushed \ndown the chain of command.\nWhen decisions taken by the \nlower levels are numerous as well \nas important an organisation can be \nregarded as greatly decentralised.\nCentralisation and \nDecentralisation\nCentralisation and decentralisation \nare relative terms, as seen from the existing status of various business enterprises.\nAn organisation is centralised \nwhen decision\n­making authority \nis retained by higher management levels whereas it is decentralised when such authority is delegated.\nComplete centralisation \nwould \nimply concentration of all decision \nmaking functions at the apex of the management hierarchy. Such a \nscenario would obviate the need for a \nmanagement hierarchy. On the other hand, complete decentralisation \nDecentralisation refers to systematic effort to delegate to the \nlowest level all authority except that which can be exercised at central points.\nLouis Allen\nEverything which goes to increase the importance of a subordinate’s role is decentralisation, everything that goes to reduce it is centralisation.\nHenri FayolDecentralisation\nCh_05.indd   130 08-08-2022   09:50:40\nReprint 2024-25"

Both the scenarios are unrealistic.\nAn organisation can never be \ncompletely centralised or decent­ralised. As it grows in size and comp­lexity , there is a tendency to move towards decentralised decision making. This is because in large organisations those employees who are directly and closely involved with certain operations tend to have more knowledge about them than the top management which may only be indirectly associated with individual operations. \nHence, there is a need for a \nbalance between these co\n­existing \nforces. Thus, it can be said that every \norganisation will be characterised by both centralisation and decentralisation.\niMportance\nDecentralisation is much more than a mere transfer of authority to the lower levels of management hierarchy. It is \na philosophy that implies selective dispersal of authority because it propagates the belief that people are competent, capable and resourceful. They can assume the responsibility for the effective implementation of their decisions. Thus this philosophy recognises the decision maker’s need for autonomy. The management, however, needs to carefully select \nthose decisions which will be pushed down to lower levels and those that will be retained for higher levels. Table 4 provides a comparative look between delegation and decentralisation.\nDecentralisation is a fundamental \nstep and its importance can be understood from the following points:\n (i) Develops initiative among subordinates: Decentralisation helps to promote self\n­reliance \nand confidence amongst the subor\ndinates. This is because \nwhen lower managerial levels are given freedom to take their own decisions they learn to depend on their own judgment. It also keeps them in a state wherein they are constantly challenged and have to develop solutions for the various problems they encounter. A decentralisation policy helps to identify those executives who have the necessary potential to become dynamic leaders.\n (ii) Develops managerial talent for the future: Formal training plays an important part in equipping subor \ndinates with \nskills that help them rise in the organisation but equally \nimportant is the experience gained by handling assignments independently. Decentralisation gives them a chance to prove their abilities and creates a reservoir of qualified manpower \nCh_05.indd   131 08-08-2022   09:50:40\nReprint 2024-25"

It also helps to identify those who may not be successful in assuming greater responsibility. Thus, it is a means of management education as well as an opportunity for trained manpower to use its talent in real life situations.\n (iii) Quick decision making: The management hierarchy can be looked upon as a chain of\n \ncommunication. In centralised \norganisation because every decision is taken by the top management the flow of information is slow as it has to traverse many levels. Response also takes time. This reduces the speed of decision making and makes it difficult for an enterprise to adapt to dynamic operating conditions. In a decentralised organisation, however ,since decisions are taken at levels which are nearest to the points of action and there is no requirement for approval from many levels, the process is much faster. There are also less chances of information getting distorted because it doesn’t have to go through long channels.\n (iv) Relief to top management:  \nDecentralisation diminishes the \namount of direct supervision exercised by a superior over the \nactivities of a subordinate because \nthey are given the freedom to act and decide albeit within the limits set by the superior. Also, personal supervision is generally replaced by other forms of control such as return on investment etc. Decentralisation also leaves the top management with more time which they can devote to important policy decisions rather than occupying their time with both policy as well as operational decisions. In  fact decentralisation is greatest when checking required on decisions taken by lower levels of management is least.\n (v) Facilitates growth: Decentrali­sation awards greater autonomy to t\nhe lower levels of management as \nwell as divisional or departmental heads. This allows them to function in a manner best suited to their department and fosters a sense of competition amongst the departments. Consequently, with each department doing its \nbest in a bid to outdo the other, the productivity levels increase and the organisation is able to generate more returns which can be used for expansion purposes.\n (vi) Better control: Decentralisation makes it possible to evaluate \nperformance at each level and the departments can be individually \nCh_05.indd   132 08-08-2022   09:50:40\nReprint 2024-25"

The extent of achievement \nof organisational objectives as well as the contribution of each department in meeting the overall objectives can be ascertained. Feedback from all levels helps to analyse variances and improve operations. In decentralisation, one of the challenges is the accountability  of performance. In response to this challenge, better control systems are  \nbeing evolved such as the balance  \nscore card and management infor­mation system. Decentralisation \ncompels the management to innovative performance  \nmeasur\n ement systems.\nAs a conclusion, it must be \nnoted that in spite of its benefits \ndecentralisation should be applied with caution as it can lead to organisational disintegration if the departments start to operate on their own guidelines which may be contrary to the inter\nest of the organisation. \nDecentralisation must always be \nbalanced with centralisation in areas \nof major policy decisions.\nThe McNeil name has been associated with the manufacturing and sale of pharmaceutical \nproducts since 1879, when Robert McNeil opened his first retail drug outlet in Pennsylvania.

The advantages of such a structure are specialisation, better control, managerial efficiency and ease in training employees. The disadvantages are functional empires, conflict of interest, inflexibility, and restriction in managerial development.Divisional structure groups activities on the basis of products. The advantages are integration, product specialisation, greater accountability, flexibility, better coordination and more initiative. The disadvantages are departmental conflicts, costly process, ignoring of organisational interests, increase in requirements of general managers. Formal organisation is designed by the management to achieve organisational goals. Its advantages are fixation of responsibility, clarity of roles, unity of command and effective accomplishment of goals. Its disadvantages are procedural delays, inadequate recognition of creativity, limited in scope. Informal organisation arises out of interaction amongst people at work. Its advantages are speed, fulfillment of social needs, fills inadequacies of formal structure. Its disadvantages are:  disruptive force, resistance to change and priority to group interests.

Consequently, the challenge facing Infosys is how to attract, retain and develop its human assets in a highly competitive and dynamic environment?\nMost of the current human resource practices at Infosys \nresult from the vision of the leaders and the culture that they have created. Narayana Murthy, known for his leadership and vision is the public image of Infosys. His leadership style is humble and straight-forward, quite uncommon in the  world of Indian business. He believes in sharing wealth with his employees and in leading by example. In a knowledge-based business like Infosys, he sees the importance of consistency in rhetoric and action in empowering employees. He is credited with creating a culture of closeness and empowerment at Infosys. His management style, rare among Indian business leaders, is based on western management. 6\nAfter studying this \nchapter, you should be able to:\nn define staffing;\nn establish its relationship with Human Resource Management;\nn state the need and importance of staffing;\nn describe the steps in the staffing process;\nn state the meaning of recruitment and selection;\nn identify important sources of recruitment;\nn describe the steps in the selection process;\nn appreciate the need of training and development; and\nn explain various on the job and off the job methods of training.

It is an established fact that the growth of an organisation requires the continual infusion of quality staff. Thus, adequate staffing or the provision for appropriate human resources is an essential requirement for any organisation’s success. It is, therefore, believed that an organisation can achieve its objectives only when it has the right persons in the right positions. \nMeanIng\nAfter planning and selection of the  organisation structure, the next step in the management process is to fill the various posts provided in the organisation. This is termed as the management of staffing function. In the simplest terms, staffing is ‘putting people to jobs’. It begins with workforce planning and includes different other function like recruitment, selection, training, development, promotion, compensation and performance appraisal of work force. In other words, staffing is that part of the process of management which is concerned with obtaining, utilising and maintaining a satisfactory and satisfied work force. Today, staffing may involve any combination of employees including daily wagers, consultants and contract employees. Staffing recognises the importance of every single person employed by an organisation as it is the individual worker, who is the ultimate performer. \nStaffing has been described as \nthe managerial function of filling and keeping filled the positions in the organisation structure. This is achieved by, first of all, identifying requirement of work force, followed by recruitment, selection, placement, promotion, appraisal and development of personnel, to fill the roles designed into the organisation  structure.\nIn a new enterprise, the staffing \nfunction follows the planning and organising functions. After deciding what is to be done, how it is to be done and after creation of the organisation structure, the management is in a position to know the human resource requirements of the enterprise at different levels. Once the number and types of personnel to be selected is determined, management starts with the activities relating to recruiting, selecting and training people, to fulfill the requirements of the enterprise. In an existing  enterprise, staffing is a continuous process because new jobs may be created and some of the existing employees may leave the organisation.\nIMportance  of StaffIng\nIn any organisation, there is a need  \nfor people to perform work.

Basically, staffing fills the positions as shown in the organisation structure. \nHuman resources are the foundation \nof any business. The right people can help you take your business to the top; the wrong people can break your business. Hence, staffing is the most fundamental and critical drive of organisational performance. The staffing function has assumed greater importance these days because of rapid advancement of technology, increasing size of orga\n nisation and \ncomplicated behaviour of human beings. Human resources are the most\n \nimportant asset of an organisation. The ability of an organisation to achieve its goal depends upon the quality of its human resources. Therefore, staffing is a very important managerial function. No organisation can be successful unless it can fill and keep filled the various positions provided for in the structure with the right kind of people. \nProper  staffing  ensures the  \nfollowing benefits to the organisation:\n (i) helps in discovering and obtai­ning competent personnel for various jobs;\n (ii) makes for higher performance, by putting right person on the right job;\n (iii) ensures the continuous survival and growth of the enterprise thr\nough the succession planning \nfor managers; (iv) helps to ensure optimum utili­sation of the human resources. By \navoiding overmanning, it \nprevents under ­utilisation of \npersonnel and high labour costs. At the same time \nit avoids \ndisruption of work by indicating in advance the shortages of personnel; and\n (v) improves job satisfaction and morale of employees through objective assessment and \nfair \nreward for their contribution.\nStaffing function must be performed \nefficiently by all org anisations. If right \nkind of employees are not available, it will lead to wastage of materials, time, effort and energy, resulting in lower productivity and poor quality of products. The enterprise will not be able to sell its products profitably. It is, therefore, essential that right kind of people must be available in right number at the right time. They should be given adequate training so that wastage is minimum. They must also be induced to show higher productivity and quality by offering them proper incentives.\nStaffing as part of Human Resource Management\nIt is a function which all managers need to perform. It is a separate and specialised function and there are many aspects of human relations to be considered. It is the job of managers to fill positions in their organisation and to make sure that \nCh_06.indd   141 08-08-2022   10:06:10\nReprint 2024-25"

Staffing is closely linked to organising since after the structure and positions have been decided, people are required to work in these positions. Subsequently, they need to be trained and motivated to work in harmony with the goals of the organisation. Thus, staffing is seen as a generic function of management. \nThe staffing function deals with \nthe human element of management. Managing the human component of an organisation is the most important task because the performance of an organisation depends upon how well this function is performed. The success of an organisation in achieving its goals is determined to a great extent on the competence, motivation and performance of its human resource.\nIt is the responsibility of all managers \nto directly deal with and select people to work for the organisation. When the manager performs the staffing function his role is slightly limited. Some of these responsibilities will include placing the right person on the right job, introducing new employees to the organisation, training employees and improving their performance, developing their abilities, maintaining their morale and protecting their health and physical conditions. In small organisations, managers may perform all duties related to employees salaries, welfare and working conditions.But as organisations grow and \nnumber of persons employed increases, a separate department called the human resource department is formed which has specialists in managing people. The management of human resource is a specialised area which requires the expertise of many people. The number of human resource specialists and size of this department gives an indication of the size of the business as well. For a very large company, the Human Resources Department itself will contain specialists for each function of this department.\nHuman Resource Management \nincludes many specialised activities and duties which the human resource perso\n nnel must perform. These duties \nare:\nn Recruitment, i.e., search for qualified people\nn Analysing jobs, collecting inform­ation about jobs to prepare job descriptions.\nn Developing compensation and incentive plans.\nn Training and development of  \nemployees for efficient perfor­mance and career gr\nowth.\nn Maintaining labour relations and union management relations.\nn Handling grievances and complaints.\nn Providing for social security and welfare of employees.\nn Defending the company in law suits and avoiding legal complications.\nCh_06.indd   142 08-08-2022   10:06:10\nReprint 2024-25"

Human Resource Management (HRM) in its present form has evolved from a number of significant inter\n­related developments, which \ndate back to the era of industrial revolution. Emergence of trade union movement led to the need of a person who could act as an effective link between the owners and workers. Thus, the concept of labour welfar\ne \nofficer came into being. His role was limited to the bare minimum welfare activities of employees. In fact, he was looked down by both the workers and the owners. \nWith the introduction of factory \nsystem, thousands of persons began \nto be employed under one roof. The job of hiring people for the organisation was given to one man, who later on was assigned the responsibility of recruitment, selection and placement of personnel. This led to the emergence of personnel officer in the first place and personnel manager, \nlater on. \nHuman relations approach recog\n­\nnises human factor as the most \nimportant instrument of success in  \nan or\nganisation. Fast changing tech­\nnological developments, however, nec­\nessitated new skill development and training of employees. People came to be recognised as a valuable resource, which can be further developed. Increase in scope of the work led to replacement of personnel manager with human resource manager.\nYou may have observed that all \nthese aspects  are concerned with the human element in industry as distinct from the mechanical side of the enterprise. Thus, staffing is an inherent part of human resource management as it is the practice of finding, evaluating and establishing a working relationship with people, for a purpose. \nIt is important to understand \nthat staffing is both a function of management just like planning, organising, directing, and controlling as well as a distinct functional area of management just as marketing management and financial management. Staffing, is therefore, referred to as both a line as well as a staff activity i.e., an essential function of the manager as well as an advisory role played by the Human Resource Department.\nStaffIng  proceSS\nAs you are now aware, the prime concern of the staffing function in the management process is the timely fulfillment of the manpower requirements within an organisation. These requirements may arise in case of starting a new \nCh_06.indd   143 08-08-2022   10:06:10\nReprint 2024-25"

In any case, need for ‘the right person for the right job’ hardly needs an over emphasis. But just as the phrase ‘water water everywhere and not a drop to drink’ amplifies the fact that despite 2/3rd of the earth being water, drinkable water is a scarce commodity, so may also be said of finding ‘the right person for the right job.’ As such, it is important to appreciate staffing as a process that starts from understanding the manpower requirements within the organisation and identifying the potential sources from where it can be met, either from within the organisation or from outside. And, given that ‘the right person’ is scarce, there is need to ‘market’ the job and the organisation to the people. Even in situations where a single job vacancy might attract a few hundreds of the applicants, there is a challenge of selecting the most appropriate one. Freshly appointed persons might need orientation or training to familiarise them with the way the things are done in an organisation. And, in case they have been selected only on the basis of academic qualifications and aptitude for learning, they might need training in specific skills as well. For example, if one is selected \nby a Business Process Outsourcing (BPO) unit by virtue of being extrovert and well\n­versed in English \nspeaking, one needs to be trained in the relevant business processes,\n \ntelephone conversation etiquettes as well as diction adaptation before actual placement. The employee’s experiences during orientation and  \nplacement form his/her ‘first impression’ of the organisation. Even whilst on the job, the employees need training for upgradation of knowledge and skills and for preparing for higher responsibilities. So staff training and development is another important aspect of the staffing process. \nWhat follows is a brief description \nof the above stages.\n (i) Estimating the Manpower \nRequirements: You are aware t\nhat while designing the organis­\national structure, we undertake \nan analysis of the decisions and the decision\n­making levels, \nactivities as well as relationship among them with a view to evolving the horizontal and vertical dimensions of the structure. \nThus, various job \npositions are created. Clearly, performance of each job necessi\n tates the appointment \nof a person with a specific \nset of \neducational qualifications, skills,  \nprior experience and so on.   \nCh_06.indd   144 08-08-2022   10:06:10\nReprint 2024-25"

                "text": "Staffing145\nThus, understanding manpower \nrequirements is not merely a matter of knowing how many persons we need but also of what type.  Given that we need to encourage women, persons from backward communities and persons with special abilities (such as physically challenged, visually and hearing impaired) to assume responsible positions in our organisations, there is a need to understand, and if the need be, to redefine manpower requirements accordingly. Can  \nyou think why should we encourage such a diversity in the workforce? \nOperationally, understanding the \nmanpower requirements would nece­ssitate workload analysis on the one hand and workforce analysis on the other. Workload analysis would enable an assessment of the number and types of human resources necessary for the performance of various jobs and accomplishment of organisational objectives. Workforce analysis would reveal the number and type available. In fact such an exercise would reveal whether we are understaffed, overstaffed or optimally staffed. It may be pointed out that neither over\n­staffing \nnor under ­staffing is a desirable \nsituation. Can you think why? In fact this exercise would \nform the basis \nof the subsequent staffing actions.  A situation of overstaffing somewhere would necessitate employee removal or transfer elsewhere. A situation of understaffing would necessitate the starting of the recruitment process.  However, before that can be done, it is important to translate the manpower requirements into specific job description and the desirable profile of its occupant — the desired qualifications, experience, personality characteristics and so on. This information becomes the base for looking for potential employees.\n (ii) Recruitment: Recruitment may be defined as the process of searching for pr\nospective employees and \nstimulating them to apply for jobs in the organisation. The information generated in the process of writing the job description and  the candidate profile may be used for developing the ‘situations vacant’ advertisement. The advertisement may be displayed on the factory/office gate or else it may be got published in print media or flashed in electronic media. This step involves locating the potential candidate or determining the sources of potential candidates. In fact, there are a large number of recruitment avenues available to a firm which would be discussed latter when we talk about the various sources of recruitment. The essential objective is to create a pool of the prospective \nCh_06.indd   145 08-08-2022   10:06:10\nReprint 2024-25"

The employee is given a brief presentation about the company and is introduced to his superiors, subordinates and the colleagues. He is taken ar\nound the workplace and given \nthe charge of the job for which he has been selected. This process of familiarisation is very crucial and may have a lasting impact on his decision to stay and on his job performance. Orientation is, thus, introducing the selected employee to other employees and familiarising him with the rules and policies of the organisation. Placement refers to the employee job candidates. Both internal and external sources of recruitment may be explored. Internal sources may be used to a limited extent. For fresh talent and wider choice external sources are used.\n (iii) Selection: Selection is the pro­\ncess of choosing from among the pool of the prospective job candidates developed at the stage\n \nof recruitment. Even in case of highly specialised  jobs where  the choice space is very narrow, the rigour of the selection process serves two important purposes:  \n(i) it ensures that the organisation gets the best among the available, and (ii) it enhances the self\n­esteem \nand prestige of \nthose selected and \nconveys to them the seriousness with which the things are done in the organisation. The rigour involves a host of tests and interviews, described later.

Every one must have the opportunity to rise to the \ntop. The best way to \nprovide such an opportunity is to facilitate employee learning. Organisations have either in\n­\nhouse training centers or have forged alliances with training and educational institutes to ensure continuing lear\nning of their  \nemployees. The organisations too benefit in turn. If employee motivation is high, their competencies are strengthened, they perform better and thus, contribute more to organisational effectiveness and efficiency. By offering the opportunities for career advancement to their members, organisations are not only able to attract but also retain its talented people.\nAs discussed earlier, in most \norganisations there is a separate \nHuman Resource Department, which takes care of the staffing function. But in small organisations the line manager is required to perform all the functions of management viz, planning, organising, staffing, directing and controlling. The process of staffing will then include three more stages. (vi) Performance Appraisal\n  After the employees have undergone a period of training and they have been on the job for some time, there is a need to evaluate their performance. All organisations have some for\nmal or informal means of \nappraising their employee’s performance. Performance appraisal means evaluating an employee’s current and/or past performance as against certain predetermined standards. The employee is expected to know what the standards are and the superior is to provide the employee feedback on his/her performance. The performance appraisal process, therefore, will include defining the job, appraising performance and providing feedback.\n (vii) Promotion and career planning\n  It becomes necessary for all organisations to address car\neer \nrelated issues and promotional avenues for their employees. Managers need to design activities to serve employees’  \nlong\n­term interests also. They \nmust encourage employees to grow and r\nealise their full \npotential. Promotions are an integral part of people’s career. They refer to being placed in positions of increased responsibility. They usually \nCh_06.indd   147 08-08-2022   10:06:12\nReprint 2024-25"

There are various ways to prepare dif\nferent \npay plans depending on the worth of the job. Basically the price of the job needs to be determined. Compensation, therefore, refers to all forms of pay or rewards going to employees. It may be in the form of direct financial payments like wages, salaries, incentives, commissions and bonuses and indirect payments like employer paid insurance and vacations.\nDirect financial payments \nare of two types : time based or performance based. A time based plan means salary and wages are paid either daily, weekly or monthly or annually. Performance based plans means salary/wages are paid according to piecework. For example, a worker may be paid according to the number of units produced by him/her. There are many methods to calculate the compensation under various incentive plans to reward performance. Certain pay plans can be created which are a combination of time based pay plus incentives for higher performance. Various plans may be formulated for paying employees time based wage or salary as well as performance based financial incentives and bonuses, and employee benefits.\nBesides there are some other \nfactors also which influence the \ndesign of any pay plan, like legal (labour laws), union, company policy and equity.\nThus, we see that as a process, \nstaffing  includes acquisition, rete\n ntion, \ndevelopment, performance appraisal, promotion and compensation of the most important resour\nce of an \norganisation, that is, its human capital. \nIt needs to be kept in mind that \nseveral factors such as supply and demand of specific skills in the labour market, unemployment rate, labour market conditions, legal and political considerations, company’s image, policy, human resource planning cost, technological developments and general economic environment etc., will influence the way recruitment, selection and training will be actually carried out.\naSpectS  of StaffIng\nThere are three aspects of staffing: recruitment, selection and training. These are now discussed in detail.\nrecruItMent\nRecruitment refers to the process of finding possible candidates for a job or a function.

Thus, there are two sources of recruitment – Internal \nand External. \nInternal Sources \nThere are two important sources \nof internal recruitment, namely, transfers and promotions, which are \ndiscussed below:\n (i) Transfers: It involves shifting \nof an employee from one job \nto another, one department to another or from one shift to another, without a substantive change in the r\nesponsibilities \nand status of the employee. It \nmay lead to changes in duties ‘the process of searching for prospective employees and stimulating them to apply for jobs in an organisation.’\nAdvertising is commonly \npart of  the recruitment process, and can occur  through several means, through newspapers, using newspaper dedicated to job advertisement, through professional publication, using advertisements placed in windows, through a job center, through campus interviews, etc.\nSources of Recruitment\nThe object of recruitment is to attract potential employees with the necessary characteristics or qualification, in the  \nadequate number for the jobs available. It locates available people for the job and invites them to apply for the job in the organisation. The process of recruitment precedes the process of selection of a right candidate for the given positions in the organisation. Recruitment seeks to attract suitable applicants to apply for available jobs.

Transfer is a good source of filling the vacancies with employees from over\n­staffed \ndepartments. It is practically a horizontal movement of employees. Shortage of suitable personnel in one branch may be filled thr\nough transfer from \nother branch or department. Job transfers are also helpful in avoiding termination and in removing individual problems and grievances. At the time of transfer, it should be ensured that the employee to be transferred to another job is capable of performing it. Transfers can also be used for training of employees for learning different jobs.\n (ii) Promotions: Business enterprises \ngenerally follow the practice of filling higher jobs by promoting employees from lower jobs. Promotion leads to shifting an employee to a higher position, carrying higher r\nesponsibilities, \nfacilities, status and pay. Promo\n tion is a vertical shifting \nof em  ployees. This practice \nhelps to improve the motivation, loyalty and satisfaction level of employees. It has a great psycho\n logical impact over the \nemployees because a promotion at the higher level may lead to a chain of promotions at lower levels in the or\nganisation.Merits of Internal Sources\nFilling vacancies in higher jobs from \nwithin the organisation or through internal transfers has the following merits:\n (i) Employees are motivated to improve their performance. A promotion at a higher level may lead \nto a chain of promotion at \nlower levels in the organisation. This motivates the employees to improve their performance through learning and practice. Employees work with commitment and loyalty and remain satisfied with their jobs. Also peace prevails in the enterprise because of promotional avenues;\n (ii) Internal recruitment also simpli­fies the pr\nocess of selection and \nplacement. The candidates that are already working in the enterprise can be evaluated more accurately and economically. This is a more reliable way of recruitment since the candidates are already known to the organisation; \n (iii) Transfer is a tool of training \nthe \nemployees to prepare them for higher jobs. Also people recruited from within the organisation do not need induction training;\n (iv) Transfer has the benefit of shifting workforce from the surplus departments to those where there is shortage of staf\nf;\nCh_06.indd   150 08-08-2022   10:06:13\nReprint 2024-25"

Hence, complete reliance on internal recruitment involves danger of ‘inbreeding’ by stopping ‘infusion of new blood’ into the organisation;\n (ii) The employees may become lethargic if they are sure of time\n­\nbound promotions;\n (iii) A new enterprise cannot use internal sources of recruitment. No organisation can fill all its vacancies from inter\nnal sources;\n (iv) The spirit of competition among the employees may be hampered; and\n (v) Frequent transfers of employees may often reduce the productivity of the or\nganisation.\nExternal Sources \nAn enterprise has to tap external sources for various positions because all the vacancies cannot be filled through internal recruitment. The existing staff may be insufficient or they may not fulfill the eligibility criteria of the jobs to be filled. External recruitment provides wide \nchoice and brings new blood in the organisation. The commonly used external sources of recruitment are discussed below:\n (i) Direct Recruitment: Under the direct recruitment, a notice is placed on the notice\n­board \nof the enterprise specifying the details of the jobs available. Job\n­\nseekers assemble outside the premises of the organisation on the specified date and selection is \ndone on the spot. The practice \nof direct recruitment is followed usually for casual vacancies of unskilled or semi\n­skilled jobs. \nSuch workers are known as casual or ‘\nbadli’ workers and they  \nare paid remuneration on daily wage basis. This method of recruitment is very inexpensive as it does not involve any cost of advertising the vacancies. It is suitable for filling casual vacancies when there is a rush of work or when some permanent workers are absent.\n (ii) Casual Callers: Many reputed \nbusiness organisations keep a database of unsolicited applicants in their offices. Such job\n­seekers can be a valuable \nsource of man  power. A list \nof such job ­seekers can be \nprepared and can be screened to fill the vacancies as they arise. The major \nmerit of this source \nCh_06.indd   151 08-08-2022   10:06:13\nReprint 2024-25"

                "text": "152\nBusiness Studies\nof recruitment is that it reduces \nthe cost of recruiting workforce in comparison to other sources.\n (iii) Advertisement: Advertisement \nin newspapers or trade and professional journals is generally used when a wider choice is\n \nrequired. Most of the senior positions of industry as well as commerce are filled by this method. The advantage of advertising vacancies is that more \ninformation about the organisation \nand job can be given in the advertisement. Advertisement gives the management a wider range of candidates from which to choose. Advertisements may be placed in leading newspapers. Its disadvantage is that it may bring in a flood of response, and many times, from quite unsuitable candidates.\n (iv) Employment Exchange: Emp­loyment exchanges run by the Government are regarded as a good sour\nce of recruitment for \nunskilled and skilled operative jobs. In some cases, compulsory notification of vacancies to employment exchange is required  by law. Thus, employment exchanges help to match personnel demand and supply by serving as link between job\n­seekers and employers. \nUnfortunately, the records of employment exchange are often not up to date and many of the \ncandidates referr\ned by them may \nnot be found suitable. \n (v) Placement Agencies and Management Consultants:\n In \ntechnical and professional areas, private agencies \nand \nprofessional bodies appear to be doing substantive work. Placement agencies provide a nationwide service in matching personnel demand and supply. These agencies compile bio\n­data \nof a large number of candidates and recommend suitable names to their clients. Such agencies charge fee for their services and they are useful wher \ne extensive \nscreening is required. These professional recruiters can entice the needed top executives from other companies by making the right offers. \n   Management consultancy \nfirms help the organisations \nto \nrecruit technical, professional and managerial personnel. They specialise in middle level and  \ntop level executive placements. They maintain data bank of  \npersons with different qualifica­tions and skills and even advertise the jobs on behalf of their clients to recruit right type of personnel.\n (vi) Campus Recruitment: Colleges \nand institutes of management \nand technology have become a \nCh_06.indd   152 08-08-2022   10:06:13\nReprint 2024-25"

Recruitment fr\nom educational institutions is \na well ­established practice of \nbusinesses. This is referred to as campus recruitment.\n (vii) Recommendations of Emp­\nloyees: Applicants introduced \nby present employees, or their friends and r\nelatives may prove to \nbe a good source of recruitment. Such applicants are likely to be good employees because their background is sufficiently known. A type of preliminary screening takes place because the present employees know both the company and the candidates and they would try to satisfy both.\n (viii) Labour Contractors: Labour contractors maintain close contacts with labourers and they can provide\n \nthe required number of unskilled workers at short notice. Workers are recruited through labour contractors who are themselves employees of the organisation. The disadvantages of this system are that if the contractor himself decides to leave the organisation, all the workers employed through him \nwill follow suit. \n (ix) Advertising on Television: The \npractice of telecasting of vacant posts over Television is gaining importance these days. The detailed requirements of the job and the qualities requir\ned to do \nit are publicised alongwith the profile of the organisation where vacancy exists.\n (x) Web Publishing: Internet is \nbecoming a common source of r\necruitment these days.

The management has a wider choice while selecting the people for employment.\n (iii) Fresh Talent: The present employees may be insuf\nficient \nor they may not fulfill the specifications of the jobs to be filled. External recruitment  provide wider choice and brings new blood in the organisation. However, it is expensive and time\n­\nconsuming.\n (iv) Competitive Spirit: If a company taps external sources, the extisting staff will have to compete with the outsiders. They will work \nharder to show better \nperformance.\nLimitations of External Sources\n 1. Dissatisfaction among existing staff:  \nExternal r\necruitment may lead \nto dissatisfaction and frustration \namong existing employees. They may feel that their chances of promotion are reduced. 2. Lengthy process: Recruitment \nfrom external sources takes a long time. The business has to notify the vacancies and wait for applications to initiate the selection pr\nocess.\n 3. Costly process: It is very costly to recruit staff fr\nom external \nsources. A lot of money has to be spent on advertisement and processing of applications.\nSelectIon\nSelection is the process of identifying and choosing the best person out of a number of prospective candidates for a job. Towards this purpose, the candidates are required to take a series of employment tests and interviews.  At every stage many are eliminated and a few move on to the next stage until the right type is found.  The process may start right from the screening of the applications. It may continue even after the offer of employment, acceptance and joining of the candidate. It is so because the process of selection, like any other managerial decision, involves judgment about the performance potential of the candidate. The effectiveness of the selection process would ultimately be tested in terms of on\n­the­job of the \nchosen person.\nProcess of Selection\nThe important steps in the process of selection are as follows: \n (i) Preliminary Screening: Preli­minary screening helps the \nCh_06.indd   154 08-08-2022   10:06:13\nReprint 2024-25"

The company asked its employees to recommend candidates, and decided to reward those who successfully recommended more women for the same roles. As employee referrals become an established method to hire quality lateral talent, companies are using technology platforms to build a steady talent pipeline through referrals. A majority of companies (nearly 41%, according to one study) across India use top technology for referral hires. According to the study India Recruiting T rends 2016 conducted by LinkedIn Talent Solutions, employee referrals are on the rise. This year, referrals were the top source of quality hires. “Nearly 55% of talent leaders see employee referral programmes as the top source of quality hire,” says Irfan Abdulla, director, talent solutions, LinkedIn India. T op players such as Coca-Cola, Infosys, Genpact, Capgemini, Deloitte, Dabur, Jubilant and more are reporting that over 40% of their hires come through referrals. \nT oday, technology major Infosys, for instance, has enhanced the use of technology for the \nemployee referral process. It has created a portal where employees can view requirements and submit profiles of candidates directly. Employees can then track the status of their referral real-time. Richard Lobo, senior vice president and head HR, Infosys, says a majority of their hiring now takes place through the referral route. “Employees can make a good referral decision as they understand the aspirations of the candidate they refer as well as the requirements and culture of the company,” he said. \n \nSource: https://economictimes.indiatimes.com ›, August 19, 2016...Hiring via employee referrals on the rise\nCh_06.indd   155 08-08-2022   10:06:13\nReprint 2024-25"

But the rapid changes taking place during the last quarter century in our highly sophisticated and complex society have created increased pressures for organisations to readapt the products and services produced, the manner in which products and services are produced and offered, the types of jobs required and the types of skills necessary to complete these jobs.

It is the understanding and interpretation of knowledge. It does not provide definite answers, but rather develops a logical and rational mind that can determine relationships among pertinent variables and thereby understand a phenomenon. Education imparts qualities of mind and character and understanding of the basic principles and develop the capacities of analysis, synthesis and objectivity.

Training is tied to the goals of organisations more than to the goals of the individual. \nDevelopment refers to the \nlearning opportunities designed to help employees grow.

The ability of an organisation to achieve its goal depends upon the quality of its human resources.Staffing as part of Human Resource Management: Staffing is a function which all managers need to perform. It is a separate and specialised function and there are many aspects of human relations to be considered.It is the responsibility of all managers to directly deal and select people to work for the organisation. When the manager performs the staffing function his role is slightly limited. In small organisations, managers may perform all duties related to employees salaries, welfare and working conditions.But as organisations grow and number of persons employed increases, a separate department called the human resource department is formed which has specialists in the field to manage people.Human Resource Management includes many specialised activities and duties which the human resource personnel must perform. Evolution of HRM: Human resource management has replaced the traditional concept of labour welfare and personnel management. HRM in its present form has evolved from a number of significant inter\n­related developments, which date back to the era of industrial \nrevolution. Emergence of trade union movement led to the need of a person who could act as an effective \nlink between the owners and \nworkers.You may have observed that all these aspects  are concerned with the human element in the industry as distinct from the mechanical side of the enterprise. Thus, staffing is an inherent part of human resource management as it is the practice of finding, evaluating and establishing a working relationship with people, for a purpose.Staffing Process: The prime concern of the staffing function in the management process is the timely fulfillment of the manpower requirements within an organisation. Estimating the Manpower Requirements: Performance of each \njob necessitates the appointment of a person with a specific set of educational qualifications, skills, prior experience and so on. Operationally, understanding the manpower requirements would necessitate workload analysis on the one hand and workforce analysis on the other. \nCh_06.indd   164 08-08-2022   10:06:14\nReprint 2024-25"

Development refers to the learning opportunities designed to help employees grow.\nTraining Methods\nThere are various methods of training. These are broadly categorised into two groups: On\n­the­Job and Off ­the­Job methods. \nOn the Job Methods(i) Apprenticeship Programs (ii) Coaching (iii) Internship Training (iv) Job Rotation Off the Job Methods(i) Class Room Lectur\nes/Conferences (ii) Films (iii) Case Study \n(iv) Computer Modelling (v) Vestibule Training (vi) Programmed Instruction.\nVery Short Answer Type\n1.\n  What is meant by staffing?\n2.

Business organisations have always given due importance to its managers who are capable of leading others. A manager needs to use various ways to lead, motivate and inspire the subordinates and to communicate with them suitably. \nThese ways, discussed in the present chapter, are collectively called the directing function of management.\nMeanIng\nIn the ordinary sense, directing means giving instructions and guiding people in doing work. In our daily life, we come across many situations like a hotel owner directing his employees \nto complete certain activities for organising a function, a teacher directing his student to complete an assignment, a film director directing the artists about how they should act in the film etc. In all these situations, we can observe that directing is done to achieve some predetermined objective.\nIn the context of management of \nan organisation, directing refers to the process of instructing, guiding, counselling, motivating and leading people in the organisation to achieve its objectives. \nYou can observe here that directing \nis not a mere issue of communication but encompasses many elements like supervision, motivation and leadership. It is one of the key managerial functions performed by every manager. Directing is a managerial process which takes place throughout the life of an \norganisation.\nThe main characteristics of \ndirecting are discussed below:\n (i) Directing initiates action: Directing is a key managerial function. A manager has to per\nform this \nfunction along with planning, \norganising, staffing and controlling while discharging his duties in the organisation. While other functions prepare a setting for action, directing initiates action in the organisation.\n (ii) Directing takes place at every level of management: Every manager, fr\nom top executive to supervisor \nperforms the function of directing. The directing takes place wherever superior – subordinate relations exist.\n (iii) Directing is a continuous process:  \nDirecting is a continuous activity. It takes place throughout the life \nof the organisation irrespective of people occupying managerial positions. We can observe that in organisations like Infosys, Tata, \nBHEL, HLL and the managers may change but the directing process continues because without dir\nection \nthe organisational activities can  \nnot continue further.\n (iv) Directing flows from top to bottom: \nDirecting is first initiated at top \nlevel and flows to the bottom through organisational hierarchy. \nCh_07.indd   170 08-08-2022   10:35:54\nReprint 2024-25"

                "text": "Directing171\nIt means that every manager can \ndirect his immediate subordinate and take instructions from his immediate boss.\nIMportance  of dIrectIng\nThe importance of directing can be understood by the fact that every action in the organisation is initiated through directing only. Directing guides towards achievement of common objectives. Through directing, managers not only tell the people in the organisation as to what they should do, when they should do and how they should do but also see that their instructions are implemented in proper perspective. Very often, this becomes an important factor in the efficient and effective functioning of the organisation. The points which emphasise the importance of directing are presented as follows:\n (i) Directing helps to initiate action by people in the organisation towards\n \nattainment of desired objectives. For example, if a supervisor guides his subordinates and clarifies their doubts in performing a task, it will help the worker to achieve work targets given to him.\n (ii) Directing integrates employees-efforts in the organisation in such a way that every individual ef\nfort \ncontributes to the organisational performance. Thus, it ensures that the individuals work for organisational goals. For example, a manager with good leadership abilities will be in a position to convince the employees working under him that individual efforts and team effort will lead to achievement of organisational goals.\n (iii) Directing guides employees to fully realise their potential and capabilities by motivating and pr\noviding effective leadership. A \ngood leader can always identify the potential of his employees and motivate them to extract work up to their full potential.\n (iv) Directing facilitates introduction of needed changes in the organi\n-\nsation. Generally, people have a tendency to resist changes in the organisation. Ef\nfective \ndirecting through motivation, communication and leadership helps to reduce such resistance and develop required cooperation in introducing changes in the organisation. For example, if a manager wants to introduce new system of accounting, there may be initial resistance from accounting staff. But, if manager explains the purpose, provides training and motivates with additional rewards, the employees may accept change and cooperate with manager.\n (v) Effective directing helps to bring stability and \nbalance in \nthe organisation since it fosters cooperation and commitment \nCh_07.indd   171 08-08-2022   10:35:54\nReprint 2024-25"

A manager has to deal with people with diverse \nbackground, and expectations. This comp\n licates the directing process. \nCertain guiding principles of directing\n \nmay help in directing process. These principles are briefly explained below:\n (i) Maximum individual contribution:  \nThis principle emphasises that directing techniques must help every individual in the organisation to contribute to his maximum potential for achievement of organisational objectives. It should\n \nbring out untappted energies of employees for the efficiency of organisation. For example, a good motivation plan with suitable monetary and non-monetary rewards can motivate an employee to contribute his maximum efforts for the organisation as he or she may feel that their efforts will bring them suitable rewards.\n (ii) Harmony of objectives: Very often,  \nwe find that individual objectives of\n \nemployees and the organisational \nobjectives as understood are conflicting to each other. For example, an employee may expect attractive salary and monetary benefits to fulfill his personal needs. The organisation may expect employees to improve productivity to achieve expected profits. But, good directing should provide harmony by convincing that employee rewards and work efficiency are complimentary to each other.\n (iii) Unity of Command: This principle insists that a person in the organisation should receive instructions from one superior only. If instructions ar\ne received \nfrom more than one, it creates confusion, conflict and disorder in the organisation. Adherence to this principle ensures effective direction.\n (iv) Appropriateness of direction tech­nique: Acc\nording to this principle, \nappropriate motivational and leadership technique should be used while directing the people based on subordinate needs, capabilities, attitudes and other situational variables. For example, for some people money can act as powerful motivator while for others promotion may act as effective motivator.\n (v) Managerial communication: Effe -\nctive managerial communication across all the levels in the organisation makes direction\n \neffective. Directing should convey clear instructions to create total understanding to subordinates. Through proper feedback, the \nCh_07.indd   172 08-08-2022   10:35:54\nReprint 2024-25"

He should spot and make use of such organisations for effective directing.\n (vii) Leadership: While directing the subordinates, managers should\n \nexercise good leadership as it can influence the subordinates positively without causing dissatisfaction among them.\n (viii)Follow through: Mer\ne giving of  \nan order is not sufficient. Managers should follow it up by reviewing continuously whether orders are being implemented accordingly or any problems are being encountered. If necessary, suitable modifications should be made in the directions.\neleMents  of dIrectIon\nThe process of directing involves guiding, coaching, instructing, motivating, leading the people in an organisation to achieve organisational objectives. Consider the following examples: (i) A supervisor explains a worker about operations to be carried by him on a lathe machine, (ii) A mining engineer explains about safety precautions to be followed while working in a coal mine, (iii) A Managing Director declares share in the profits to the managers for their contribution to inhance profits of the company, and (iv) A manager inspires his/her employees by playing a lead role in performing a work.\nAll these examples and many \nother activities related to directing may broadly be grouped into four categories which are the elements of directing. These are:\n (i) Supervision\n (ii) Motivation\n (iii) Leadership\n (iv) Communication\nTo know more about directing, these \nelements ar\ne discussed in detail.\nsupervIsIon\nThe term supervision can be understood in two ways. Firstly, it can be understood as an element of directing and secondly, as a function performed by supervisors in the organisational hierarchy. \nSupervision being an element of  \ndirecting, every man\n ager in the \norganisation supervises his/her subordinates. In this sense, supervision\n \ncan be understood as the process of guiding the efforts of employees and  \nother resources to accomplish the desired objectives. It means overseeing what  \nis being done by subordinates and  \ngiving instructions to ensure optimum utilisation of resources and achievement of work targets.\nSecondly, supervision can be \nunderstood as the function to be \nperformed by supervisor, a managerial \nCh_07.indd   173 08-08-2022   10:35:54\nReprint 2024-25"

She was \nrecognised by her peers and supervisors as a person who managed department in a good way. However, everyone realised that Rashmi was extremely ambitious and was seeking a higher-level management position. When one of her sales representatives did a good job, she would attempt to take the credit. However, if a problem arose, she thought it was not her fault. When the marketing manager retired, Rashmi applied for the position. The company decided to do a thorough search because of the responsibility and importance associated with the position. When the search was concluded, the decision was made to fill the position by a person from outside the company. The consensus of top management was that Rashmi, although a good district sales manager might have difficulties in working with her new peer groups. They felt that she might displease the other managers if she tried to take credit for their work and, as a result, their performance would suffer.\nRashmi was heart-broken. She had wanted that particular job for a long time and had \ndedicated all her energies towards obtaining it. She became very despondent and her work deteriorated. The department functioned inspite of her, not because of her. Decisions were made slowly if at all and she began to be late with her sales reports. Although her sales staff continued to be productive, Rashmi could not take the credit.\nWhen the new marketing manager took over, one of the first major problems that he \nconfronted was how to motivate and inspire Rashmi to her former level of performance. He recognised that Rashmi had been with the company for a long time but something had to be done to motivate her to perform really well.Directing a Dissatisfied Managerposition in the organisation hierarchy at the operative level i.e., immedia\n tely above the worker. The  \nfunctions and performance of the  \nsupervisor are vital to any or\nganisation because he is directly \nrelated with workers whereas other mangers have no direct touch with bottom level workers.\nImportance of Supervision\nThe importance of supervision can be understood from multiple roles performed by a supervisor. These are explained below:\n (i) Supervisor maintains day-to-day contact and maintains friendly relations with workers. \nA good \nsupervisor acts as a guide, friend and philosopher to the workers.\n (ii) Supervisor acts as a link between workers and management. He conveys management ideas to  \nthe workers on one hand and  \nworkers pr\noblems to the \nmanagement on the other. This role played by supervisor helps to avoid misunderstandings and conflicts between management and workers/employees.\n (iii) Supervisor plays a key role in maintaining group unity among workers placed under his contr\nol. \nHe sorts out internal differences \nCh_07.indd   174 08-08-2022   10:35:54\nReprint 2024-25"

A skilled and knowledgeable supervisor can\n \nbuild efficient team of workers.\n (vi) Supervisory leadership plays a key role in influencing the workers in the organisation. A supervisor with good leadership qualities can build up high morale among workers.\n (vii) A good supervisor analyses the work performed and gives feedback to the workers. He suggests ways and means of developing work skills.\nMotIvatIon\nThe case of Rashmi reveals an important fact of managerial work; it is not always possible to get the best of work from employees merely by exercising formal authority. What makes people to behave the way they do? Why are some people reluctant to do the work though they have ability to do? What should be done to make people work effectively?\nFor answering these questions, \na manager should try to develop insights into causes of behaviour of people. A manager may come across highly committed and hardworking staff or lazy, evasive and superficial workers. He or she may wonder what to do with workers not willing to work to their potential. Psychologists say it is motivation, which stimulates people to take up work voluntarily.\nLet us try to understand something \nabout motivation.Motivation: Motivation means inci\n-\ntement or inducement to act or move. In the context of an or\nganisation, it means \nthe process of making subordinates to act in a desired manner to achieve certain organisational goals. \nWhile discussing about motivation, \nwe need to understand three inter \nrelated terms — motive, motivation and motivators. Let us try to know \nabout these terms.\n (i) Motive: A motive is an inner state \nthat energises, activates or moves \nand directs behaviour towar\nds \ngoals. Motives arise out of the \nneeds of individuals. Realisation of a motive causes restlessness in the individual which prompts some action to reduce such restlessness. For example, the need for food causes hunger an account of which a man searches for food. Some such motives are – hunger, thirst, security, affiliation, need for comfort, recognition etc.,\n (ii) Motivation: Motivation is the \nprocess of stimulating people to action to accomplish desir\ned \ngoals. Motivation depends upon satisfying needs of people.\nCh_07.indd   175 08-08-2022   10:35:54\nReprint 2024-25"

For example, \nthe pr\nomotion in the job may \nbe given to employee with the objective of improving his performance. If the employee is interested in promotion, it helps to produce a behaviour to improve performance.\n (iii) Motivation can be either positive or negative. Positive motivation provides positive \nrewards like \nincrease in pay, promotion, recognition etc., Negative moti\n-\nvation uses negative means like punishment, stopping increments, threatening etc. which \nalso may \ninduce a person to act in the desired way.\n (iv) Motivation is a complex process as the individuals are heterogeneous\n \nin their expectations, perceptions and reactions. Any type of motivation may not have uniform effect on all the members. (iii) Motivators: Motivator is the technique used to motivate  \npeople in an organisation. Managers\n \nuse diverse motivators like pay, bonus, promotion, recognition, praise, responsibility etc., in the organisation to influence people to contribute their best.\nSome of the definitions to explain \nthe concept of motivation are given in the above box.Features of Motivation: The ana-lysis of various definitions and viewpoints on motivation reveals the following features of motivation: \n (i) Motivation is an internal feeling. The urge, drives, desires, aspi\n-\nrations, striving or needs of human being, which are internal, influence human behaviour\n. For example, \npeople may have the urge or desire for possessing a motorbike, comfortable house, reputation in the society. These urges are internal to an individual.\nMotivation means a process of stimulating people to action to accomplish desired goals \nWilliam G. Scout\nMotivation refers to the way in which urges, drives, desires, aspirations, strivings or needs direct, control and explain the behaviour of human beings.\nMc Farland\nMotivation is a complex force starting with keeping a person at work in an organisation. Motivation is something which moves the person to action and continues him in the course of action already initiated.\nDubin\nMotivation is a process which begins with a physiological or psychological need or deficiency which triggers behaviour or a drive that is aimed at a goal or incentive.\nFred LuthansDefinitions on Motivation\nCh_07.indd   176 08-08-2022   10:35:54\nReprint 2024-25"

A simple model to explain motivation process is presented below.\nThe following example explains \nthe process of satisfaction of human needs.\nRamu is very hungry since he did \nnot have breakfast in the morning. By1.00 P.M., he became restless and started walking on the road in search of a hotel for snacks or meals. After walking for 2 kms, he could find a \nhotel where roti and dal was available for ` 10. Since he had only ` 15 in \nhis pocket, he paid ` 10 and had a \nsatisfying meal. After taking a meal, he felt that he had regained energy.\nAn unsatisfied need of an individual \ncreates tension which stimulates his or her drives. These drives generate a search behaviour to satisfy such need. If such need is satisfied, the \nindividual is relieved of tension.\nIn Tata Steel several initiatives have been taken to further improve the motivation levels and participation in the decision making process of the officers, greater impetus to training through a formalised system of a personal development programme, talent review and job rotation systems, compensation linked to the performance management system, formal rewards and recognition systems, knowledge management systems linked with appraisals, leadership opportunities in quality circles, continuous improvement and value engineering programmes and an extremely transparent and credible multi-path communication system to address queries and concerns of all employees through various dialogues both formal and online, with such tools as video conferencing, ‘MD Online’, special dialogues with senior management, meetings, conferences and seminars. These initiatives have helped to build a homogeneous and focused team in Tata Steel, increasing motivation and binding to the vision of the company and spurred employees to deliver targets on a participatory management basis leading to ownership of processes.\nTata Steel is a company that actively promotes freedom to work, freedom to innovate \nand even the freedom to fail. It is a nimble, fast, modern and forward-looking company on a strong growth path. The company has undergone a revolutionary change in terms of its production facilities and the technology in the manufacturing process. These changes have resulted in creating greater opportunities for taking up newer challenges for young recruits work and for performance based on IT enabled systems and high levels of automation. These have led to making the company one of the lowest cost producers of steel and the only Indian company to be recognised by the World Steel Dynamics as one of the top most ‘World Class’ steel makers.

It is the reason why every major organisation develops various kinds of motivational programmes and spends crores of rupees on these programmes. The importance of moti\n-\nvation can be pointed out by the following benefits:\n (i) Motivation helps to improve performance levels of employees as well as the organisation. Since \nproper motivation satisfies \nthe needs of employees, they in turn devote all their energies for optimum performance in their work. A satisfied employee can always turnout expected performance. Good motivation in the organisation helps to achieve higher levels of performance as motivated employees contribute their maximum efforts for organisational goals.\n (ii) Motivation helps to change nega\n tive o\nr indifferent attitudes \nof employee to positive attitudes so as to achieve organisational goals. For example, a worker may have indifferent or negative attitude towards his work, if he is not rewarded properly. If suitable rewards are given and supervisor gives positive encouragement and praise for the good work done, the worker may slowly develop positive attitude towards the work.\n (iii) Motivation helps to reduce employee turnover and thereby\n \nsaves the cost of new recruitment and training.

Let us examine it in detail.\nAbraham Maslow, a well-known \npsychologist in a classic paper published \nin 1943, outlined the elements of an overall theory of motivation.\nHis theory was based on human \nneeds. He felt that within every human being, there exists a hierarchy of five needs. These are:\n (i) Basic Physiological Needs: These needs are most basic in the hierarchy and corr\nesponds to \nprimary needs. Hunger, thirst, shelter, sleep and sex are some examples of these needs. In the organisational context, basic salary helps to satisfy these needs.\n (ii) Safety/\nSecurity Needs:  These \nneeds provide security and protection from physical and emotional harm. Examples: job security, stability of income, Pension plans etc.,\n (iii) Affiliation/Belonging Needs: These needs refer to af\nfection, sense of \nbelongingness, acceptance and friendship.\n (iv) Esteem Needs: These include factors \nsuch as self-respect, \nauto nomy status, recognition \nand attention.\n (v) Self Actualisation Needs: It is the highest level of \nneed in the \nhierarchy. It refers to the drive to become what one is capable of recruitment and training which involve additional investment of money, time and effort. Motivation helps to save such costs. It also helps to retain talented people in the organisation.\n (iv) Motivation helps to reduce abse -\nnteeism in the organisation. Some important reasons for absenteeism \nare–bad working \nconditions, inadequate rewards, lack of recognition, poor relations with supervisors and colleagues etc. Through sound motivational system, all these deficiencies can be covered. If motivation is adequately provided, work becomes a source of pleasure and workers attend to the work regularly.\n (v) Motivation helps managers to \nintro\nduce changes smoothly \nwithout much resistance from people. Normally, for any change introduced in the organisation, there may be resistance for changes. If manager can convince employees that proposed changes will bring additional rewards to employees, they may readily \naccept the change.\nMaslow’s Need Hierarchy Theory of Motivation: Since motivation is \nhighly complex, many researchers have studied about motivation from several dimensions and developed some theories. These theories help to develop understanding about motivation phenomenon. Among \nCh_07.indd   179 08-08-2022   10:35:54\nReprint 2024-25"

These needs include \ngrowth, self-fulfillment and achi -\nevement of goals.\nMaslow’s theory is based on the \nfollowing assumptions:\n (i) People’s behaviour is based on their needs. Satisfaction of such needs influences their behaviour.\n (ii) People’s needs are in hierarchical order, starting fr\nom basic needs \nto other higher level needs.\n (iii) A satisfied need can no longer motivate a person; only next higher level need can motivate him. \n (iv) A person moves to the next higher level of the hierar\nchy only \nwhen the lower need is satisfied.\nMaslow’s Theory focuses on the \nneeds as the basis for motivation. This theory is widely recognised and appreciated. However, some of his propositions are questioned on his classification of needs and hierarchy of needs. But, despite such criticism, the theory is still relevant because needs, no matter how they are classified, are important to understand the behaviour. It helps \nmanagers to realise that need level of employee should be identified to provide motivation to them.\nFinancial and Non-Financial \nIncentives \nIncentive means all measures which \nare used to motivate people to improve performance.

Since, money has the purchasing power, it becomes a very important incentive for every individual. \nFinancial incentives refer to \nincentives which are in direct monetary form or measurable in monetary term and serve to motivate people for better performance. These incentives may be provided on individual or group basis. The financial incentives generally used in organisations are listed below:\n (i) Pay and allowances: For every employee, salary is the basic monetary incentive. It includes basic pay, dearness \nallowance \nand other allowances. Salary system consists of regular increments in the pay every year and enhancement of allowances from time-to-time. In some business organisations, pay hike and increments may be linked to performance.\n (ii) Productivity linked wage incen­tives: Several wage incentive plans aims at linking payment of wages to increase \nin productivity \nat individual or group level.\n (iii) Bonus: Bonus is an incentive offered over and above the wages/salary to the employees.\n (iv) Profit Sharing: Profit sharing is meant to provide a shar\ne \nto employees in the profits of the organisation. This serves to motivate the employees to Abraham H. Maslow was born in Brooklyn, New York, in 1908. He studied primate behavior at the University of Wisconsin, where he received his doctorate in psychology in 1934.\nEarly in his career, Maslow was drawn to the study of human motivation and \npersonality. His work in this area upset strict behaviorists, whose explanations of motivation and personality failed to account for what Maslow called the whole person. His theory of the hierarchy of needs, which leads to the ‘self-actualised’ individual, was a strong catalyst for the founding of humanistic psychology. Maslow successfully bridged motivation and personality in his theories of needs, self-actualising persons, and peak experiences.\nMaslow is considered an important figure in contemporary psychology. \nHis career was a formidable one. For 14 years he taught at Brooklyn College, and then went to Brandeis University as chairman of the Psychology Department. In 1968 he was elected president of the American Psychological Association. In 1969 he went to the Laughlin Foundation in Menlo Park, California. He wrote two important books: T oward a Psychology of Being (1968) and Motivation and Personality (1970). Abraham Maslow died of a heart attack in 1970.Profile of Abraham Maslow (1908 – 1970)\nCh_07.indd   181 08-08-2022   10:35:55\nReprint 2024-25"

Sometimes, management may allot shares in line of various incentives payable in cash. The allotment of shares creates a feeling of ownership to the employees and makes them to contribute for the growth of the organisation. In Infosys the scheme of stock option has been implemented as a part of managerial compensation.\n (vi) Retirement Benefits: Several retir\nement benefits such as \nprovident fund, pension, and gratuity provide financial security to employees after their retirement. This acts as an incentive when they are in service in the organisation.\n (vii) Perquisites: In many companies perquisites and fringe benefits ar\ne offered such as car allowance, \nhousing, medical aid, and education to the children, etc., over and above the salary. These measures help to provide motivation to the employees/managers.\nNon-Financial Incentives: All the needs of individuals are not satisfied by money alone. Psychological, social and emotional factors also play important role in providing motivation. Non-financial incentives mainly focus on these needs. Some times, monetary aspect may be involved in non-financial incentives as well. However, the emphasis is to provide psychological and emotional satisfaction rather than money driven satisfaction. For example, if an individual gets promo\n-\ntion in the organisation, it satisfies him psychologically more as he gets a feeling of elevation, incr\nease in status, \nincrease in authority, challenge in the job etc., Though promotion involves payment of extra money, non-monetary aspects over-ride monetary aspects.\nSome of the important non-financial \nincentives are discussed below:\n (i) Status: In the organisational context, status means ranking of positions in the or\nganisation. \nThe authority, responsibility, rewards, recognition, perquisites and prestige of job indicate the status given to a person holding a managerial position. Psychological, social and esteem needs of an individual are satisfied by status given to their job.\n (ii) Organisational Climate: Organi -\nsational climate indicates the characteristics which describe an organisation and distinguish one organisation fr\nom the other. \nThese characteristics influence the behaviour of individuals in the organisation. Some of these characteristics are–individual autonomy, reward orientation, consideration to employees, \nCh_07.indd   182 08-08-2022   10:35:55\nReprint 2024-25"

Managers should provide opportunity to employees to improve their skills and be promoted to the higher level jobs. Appropriate skill development programmes, and sound promotion policy will help employees to achieve promotions. Promotion works as a tonic and encourages employees to exhibit improved performance.\n (iv) Job Enrichment: Job enrichment is concerned with designing \njobs \nthat include greater variety of work content, require higher level of knowledge and skill; give workers more autonomy and responsibility; and provide the opportunity for personal growth and a meaningful work experience. If jobs are enriched and made interesting, the job itself becomes a source of motivation to the individual.\n (v) Employee Recognition  programmes:  \nMost people have a need for evaluation of their work and due recognition. They feel that what they do should be recognised by others concerned. Recognition means acknowledgment with a show of appreciation. When such appreciation is given to the work performed by employees, they feel motivated to perform/work at higher level. Some examples of employee recognition are:\nn Congratulating the employee for good performance.\nn Displaying on the notice board or in the company news letter about the achievement of employee.\nn Installing award or certificate for best performance.\nn Distributing mementos, com -\nplimentaries li\nke T-shirts \nin recognition of employee services.\nn Rewarding an employee for giving valuable suggestions.\n (vi) Job security: Employees want their job to be secure. They want ce\nrtain stability about future \nincome and work so that they do not feel worried on these aspects and work with greater zeal. In India, this aspect is more important considering the inadequate job opportunities and too many aspirants for these. However, there is one negative aspect of job security. When people feel that they are not likely to lose their jobs, they may become complacent.\n (vii) Emplo\nyee participation:  It means \ninvolving employees in decision making of the issues related to them.

Good leaders always produce goods results through their followers.\n (ii) A leader maintains personal relations and helps \nfollowers \nin fulfilling their needs.

Thus, he overcomes the problem of resistance to change and introduces it with minimum discontentment.\n (iv) A leader handles conflicts effectively and does not allow adverse effects r\nesulting from the \nconflicts.

In fact, it is not possible for any individual to have all the qualities. But an understanding about these qualities help the managers to acquire them through training and conscious efforts.\nLeadership StyleThere are many theories of leadership behaviour and styles. Research studies have revealed certain traits and qualities which a leader might possess. However, these are not conclusive since many people may possess these qualities but may not be leaders. \nThere are several bases for classifying \nleadership styles. The most popular \nclassification of leadership styles is based on the use of authority. Depending on the use of authority, there are three basic styles of leadership:\n (i) Autocratic  (ii) Democratic, and\n (iii) Laissez-faire\n (i) Autocratic or Authoritarian leader \n  An autocratic leader gives orders \nand expects his subordinates to \nobey those \norders.

His following is based on the assumption that\n \nreward or punishment both can be given depending upon the result. This leadership style is effective in getting productivity in many situations like in a factory where the supervisor is responsible for production on time and has to \nensure labour productivity. Quick decision-making is also facilitated.\n    But there are variations also, \nthey may listen to everyone’s opinion, consider subor\ndinates \nideas and concerns but the decision will be their own.\n (ii) Democratic or Participative \nleader\n  A democratic leader will develop \naction plans and makes decisions in consultation with his subordinates. He will encourage \nthem to participate \nin decision-making. This kind of leadership style is more common now-a-days, since leaders also recognise that people perform best if they have set their own objectives.

They exercise more control by using forces within the group.            (iii) Laissez faire or Free-rein leader \n  Such a leader does not believe \nin the \nuse of power unless it is absolutely \nessential. The followers are given \na high degree of independence to formulate their own objectives and ways to achieve them. The group members work on their own tasks resolving issues themselves.  The manager is there only to support them and supply them the required information to complete the task assigned. At the same time, the subordinate assumes responsibility for the work to be performed. \nDepending upon the situation \na leader may choose to exercise a combination of these styles when required. Even a laissez faire leader would have certain rules to be followed while doing work and a democratic leader may have to take his own decision in an emergency situation.\ncoMMunIcatIon  \nCommunication plays key role in the success of a manager. How much professional knowledge and intelligence a manager possesses becomes immaterial if he is not able to communicate effectively with his subordinates and create understanding in them. Directing abilities of a manager mainly depend upon his communication skills. That is why organisation always emphasise on improving communication skills of managers as well as employees.\nCh_07.indd   187 08-08-2022   10:35:57\nReprint 2024-25"

Bernard has called it the foundation of all group activities. Communication serves as the lubricant fostering for the smooth operations of the management process. The importance of communication in management \ncan be judged from the following:\n (i) Acts as basis of coordination:  \nCommunication acts as basis of coor\ndination. It provides \ncoordination among departments, activities and persons in the organisation. Such coordination is provided by explaining about organisational goals, the mode of their achievement and inter relationships between different individuals, etc. \n (ii) Helps in smooth working of an enterprise: Communication\n \nmakes possible for the smooth and unrestricted working of the enterprise. All organisational interactions depend on comm\n-\nunications. The job of a manager is to coordinate the human and physical elements of an organisation into an ef\nficient and active working unit that achieves \ncommon objectives. It is only communication which makes smooth working of an enterprise possible. Communication is basic  \nto an organisation’s existence-right from its birth through its continuing life. When communication stops, organised activity ceases to exist.\n (iii) Acts as basis of decision making: \nCommunication provides needed information \nfor decision making. \nIn its absence, it may not be possible for the managers to take any meaningful decision. Only on the basis of communication of relevant information one can take right decision.\n (iv) Increases managerial efficiency:  \nCommunication is essential for\n \nquick and effective performance of managerial functions. The management conveys the goals and targets, issues instructions, allocates jobs and responsibilities and looks after the performance of subordinates. Communication is involved in all these aspects. Thus, communication lubricates the entire organisation and keeps the organisation at work with efficiency.\n (v) Promotes cooperation and indust­\nrial\n peace: Efficient operation is the \naim of all prudent management.

The examples of upward communication are – application  \nfor grant of leave, submission of \nprogress report, request for grants, etc. Similarly, the examples of downward communication include – sending notice to employees to attend a meeting, ordering subordinates to complete an assigned work, passing on guidelines framed by top management to the subordinates, etc.\nHorizontal or lateral communication \ntakes place between one division and another.

It also leads to generate rumours which are not authentic. People’s behaviour is affected by rumours and informal discussions and sometimes may hamper work environment. Sometimes, grapevine channels may be helpful as they carry information rapidly and, therefore, may be useful to the manager at times. Informal channels are used by the managers to transmit information so as to know the reactions of his/her subordinates. An intelligent manager should make use of positive aspects \nof informal channels and minimise negative aspects of this channel  \nof communication.\nGrapevine Network\nGrapevine communication may \nfollow different types of network. \nIn single strand network, each \nperson communicates to the other in  \nsequence. In gossip network, \neach person communicates with all on non-selective basis. In probability network, the individual communicates randomly with other individual. In cluster, the individual communicates with only those people whom he trusts. Of these four types of networks, cluster is the most popular in organisations.\nBarriers to Communication\nIt is generally observed that managers face several problems due to communication breakdowns or barriers. These barriers may prevent Grapevine Communication Networks\nSingle Strand Network\nGossip Network Probability Network Cluster Network\nCh_07.indd   193 08-08-2022   10:35:59\nReprint 2024-25"

Therefore, it is important for\n \na manager to identity such barriers and take measures to overcome them.\nThe barriers to communication in the \norganisations can be broadly grouped \nas: semantic barriers, psychological barriers, organisational barriers, and personal barriers. These are briefly \ndiscussed below:\nSemantic barriers: Semantics is \nthe branch of linguistics dealing with the meaning of words and sentences. Semantic barriers are concerned with problems and obstructions in the process of encoding and decoding of message into words or impressions. Normally, such barriers result on account of use of wrong words, faulty translations, different interpretations, etc. These are discussed below:\n (i) Badly expressed message: Some times intended meaning may not be conveyed by a manager to his subordinates. These badly expressed messages may be an account of inadequate vocabulary, usage of wr\nong \nwords, omission of needed words, etc.\n (ii) Symbols with different meanings:   \nA wor\nd may have several mean -\nings.\n Receiver has to perceive one \nsuch meaning for the word used \nby communicator. For example, consider these three sentences \nwhere the work ‘value’ is used:\n(a) What is the value of this ring? \n(b) I value our friendship.\n(c) What is the value of learning \ncomputer skills?\n You will find that the ‘value’ gives differ\nent meaning in \ndifferent contexts. Wrong  \nperception leads to comm -\nunication problems.\n (iii) Faulty translations: Sometimes the communications originally drafted in one language (e.g., English) need to be translated to the language understandable to workers (e.g., Hindi). If the translator is not pr\noficient with \nboth the languages, mistakes may creep in causing different \nmeanings to the communication.\n (iv) Unclarified assumptions: Some \ncommunications may have \ncertain \nassumptions which are subject \nto different interpretations. For example, a boss may instruct his subordinate, “Take care of our guest”. Boss may mean that \nCommunication Grapevine\nCh_07.indd   194 08-08-2022   10:36:01\nReprint 2024-25"

The subordinate may interpret that guest should be taken to hotel with care. Actually, the guest suffers due to \nthese unclarified assumptions.\n (v) Technical  jargon: It is usually\n \nfound that specialists use technical \njargon while explaining to persons who are not specialists in the concerned field. Therefore, they may not understand the actual meaning of many such words.\n (vi) Body language and gesture decoding: Every movement \nof body communicates some meaning. The body movement and gestures of communicator matters so much in conveying the message. If \nthere is no \nmatch between what is said and what is expressed in body movements, communications may be wrongly perceived.\nPsychological barriers: Emotional or psychological factors acts as barriers to communicators. For example, a worried person cannot communicate properly and an angry receiver cannot understand the real meaning of message. The state of mind of both sender and receiver of communication reflects in the effective communication. Some of \nthe psychological barriers are:\n (i) Premature evaluation: Some \ntimes people evaluate the meaning of message \nbefore the \nsender completes his message. Such premature evaluation may be due to pre-conceived \nnotions or prejudices against the communication.\n (ii) Lack of attention: The pre-occupied mind of receiver and the r\nesultant non-listening of message \nacts as a major psychological barrier. For instance, an employee explains about his problems to the boss who is pre-occupied with an important file before him. The boss does not grasp the message and the employee is disappointed. \n (iii) Loss by transmission and poor retention: When communication \npasses through various \nlevels, \nsuccessive transmissions of the message results in loss of, or transmission of inaccurate information. This is more so in case of oral communication.\n  Poor retention is another problem. Usually people cannot r\netain  \nthe information for a long time if they are inattentive or not interested.\n (iv) Distrust: Distrust between comm -\nunicator and communicate acts as a barrier. If the parties do not believe each \nother, they \ncan not understand each others message in its original sense.\nOrganisational barriers: The factors related to organisation structure, authority relationships, rules and regulations may, sometimes, act as barriers to effective communication. Some of these barriers are:\nCh_07.indd   195 08-08-2022   10:36:01\nReprint 2024-25"

For example, in an organisation with highly centralised pattern, people may not be encouraged to have free communication.\n (ii) Rules and regulations: Rigid rules and cumbersome procedures may\n \nbe a hurdle to communication. Similarly, communications through prescribed channel may result in delays.\n (iii) Status: Status of superior may create psychological distance between him and his subor\ndinates. A status conscious \nmanager also may not allow his subordinates to express their feelings freely.\n (iv) Complexity in organisation \nstructure: In an organisation where \nthere are number of managerial levels, communication gets delayed and distorted as number of filtering points are more.\n (v) Organisational facilities: If facilities for smooth, clear and timely communications are not provided communications may be hamper\ned. Facilities like \nfrequent meetings, suggestion box, complaint box, social and cultural gathering, transparency in operations, etc., will encourage free flow of communication. Lack of these facilities may create \ncommunication problems.\nPersonal barriers: The personal factors of both sender and receiver may exert influence on effective \ncommunication. Some of the personal barriers of superiors and subordinates are mentioned below:\n (i) Fear of challenge to authority: If a superior perceives \nthat a \nparticular communication may adversely affect his authority, he or she may withhold or suppress such communication.\n (ii) Lack of confidence of superior on his subordinates: If superiors do not have confidence on the competency of their subordinates, they may not \nseek \ntheir advice or opinions.\n (iii) Unwillingness to communicate: \nSometimes, subordinates may not be prepared to communicate with their superiors, if they per\nceive that it may adversely \naffect their interests.\n (iv) Lack of proper incentives: If there is no motivation or incentive for communication, subor\ndinates \nmay not take initiative to communicate.

Organisations \nkeen on developing effective communi-cation should adopt suitable measures to overcome the barriers and improve communication effectiveness. Some such measures are indicated below:\n (i) Clarify the ideas before communication:  The problem to be communicated to subordinates \nshould be clear \nin all its perspective to the executive himself. The entire problem should be studied in depth, analysed and stated in such a manner that is clearly conveyed to subordinates. \n (ii) Communicate according to the needs of receiver:\n The level \nof understanding of receiver should be crystal clear to the communicator. Manager should adjust his communication according to the education and understanding levels of subordinates.\n (iii) Consult others before communicating: Before actually communicating the\n \nmessage, it is better to involve others in developing a plan for communication. Participation and involvement of subordinates may help to gain ready acceptance and willing cooperation of subordinates. \n (iv) Be aware of languages, tone \nand \ncontent of message: The contents \nof the message, tone, language used, manner in which the message is to be communicated are the important aspects \nof effective communication. The language used should be understandable to the receiver and should not offend the sentiments of listeners. The message should be stimulating to evoke response from  \nthe listeners.\n (v) Convey things of help and value to listeners: While conveying message to others, it is better to know the \ninterests and needs of \nthe people with whom you are communicating. If the message relates directly or indirectly to such interests and needs it certainly evokes response from communicatee.\n (vi) Ensure proper feedback: The communicator may ensure\n \nthe success of communication \nby asking questions regarding the message conveyed. The receiver of communication may also be encouraged to respond to communication.  \nThe communication process  \nmay be improved by the  \nfeedback received to make it  \nmore responsive.\n (vii) Communicate for present as well  \nas future:\n Generally, commun -\nication is needed to meet the exist\ning commitments to maintain \nconsis  tency, the communication \nshould aim at future goals of the enterprise also.\n (viii) Follow up communications: There should be r\negular follow up and \nreview on the instructions given to subordinates.

It includes supervision, motivation, communication and leading. The principles which guide effective directing may be classified as principles related to the purpose of directing and principles related to direction process. Supervision: It is an element of direction. It can be understood as a process as well as the functions performed by supervisor (a position at operative level). Supervision is very important as it is closely linked to overseeing the work, guiding and ensuring that targets are met by workers and employees. Motivation: Motivation is the process of stimulating people to action \nto accomplish desired goals of organisation. It is an internal feeling of an individual and leads to goal directed behaviour. Motivation is mainly based on needs of individuals. It helps individuals and groups in the organisation for improved performance. \nManagers offer incentives to employees both financial and \nnon financial. Financial incentives are monetary and may be in the form of salary, bonus, profit sharing, pension, etc. Non financial incentives provide social and psychological satisfaction. \nCh_07.indd   198 08-08-2022   10:36:01\nReprint 2024-25"

It is the process of influencing people to strive willingly for group objectives. The qualities of a good leader have been researched by many experts. Some of the qualities of good leader include–courage, will power, judgement, knowledge, integrity, physical energy, faith, moral qualities, fairness, vitality, decisiveness, social skills etc. But all these qualities cannot be possessed by one individual nor always help in their success. Communication: Communication refers to process of exchange of ideas between or among persons and create understanding. Communication process involves the elements of source, encoding, channel, receiver, decoding and feedback. In organisations, both formal and informal communications simultaneously takes place. Formal communications refers to all official communications in the form of orders, memos, appeals, notes, circulars, agenda, minutes, etc. Apart from formal communications, informal or grapevine communications also exist. Informal communications are usually in the form of rumours, whispers, etc. They are unofficial, spontaneous, unrecorded, spread very fast and usually distorted. A manager should learn to manage with informal communication also. In most of the organisations, several barriers may exist for effective communications. Some of these barriers include – semantic barriers, organisational barriers, language barriers, transmission barriers, psychological barriers and personal barriers. Managers should take appropriate measures to overcome these barriers and promote effective communication in the organisation. \nExercises\n Very Short Answer Type\n1.

T oday almost 98% of DCS manage e-ticket using interface from a number of devices including check-in kiosks, online check\n-in, mobile boarding pass and \nbaggage handling. DCS are able to identify and capture updated \nreservations from an \nairline computer reservation system for passengers called passenger name record (PNR). A DCS is used to update reservations typically as ckecked-in, boarded, and flown or another status. Additionally and increasingly a DCS or some city fare sectors may also interface with immigration control for visa, immigration and passenger no fly watch list.\nIt is quite clear from the example that all managers need to manage situations intelligently and take corrective action before any damage is done to the business. Controlling function of management comes to the rescue of a manager here. It not only helps in keeping a track on the progress of activities but also ensures that activities conform to the standards set in advance so that \norganisational goals are achieved.\nMeaning  of Controlling\nControlling is one of the important functions of a manager. In order to seek planned results from the subordinates, a manager needs to exercise effective control over the activities of the subordinates.

Controlling also ensures that an organisation’s resources are being used effectively and efficiently for the achievement of predetermined goals. Controlling is, thus, a goal-oriented function.\nControlling function of a manager \nis a pervasive function. It is a primary function of every manager. Managers at all levels of management—\n top, \nmiddle and lower-need to perfor\nm \ncontrolling functions to keep a control over activities in their areas. Moreover, controlling is as much required in an educational institution, military, hospital, and a club as in any business organisation. \nControlling should not be misunde\n-\nrstood as the last function of manage -\nment. It is a function that brings back the management cycle back to the p\nlanning function. The controlling \nfunction finds out how far actual performance deviates from standards, analyses the causes of such deviations and attempts to take corrective actions based on the same. This process helps in formulation of future plans in the light of the problems that were identified and, thus, helps in better planning in the future periods. Thus, controlling only completes one cycle of management process and improves planning in the next cycle.\nImportance of Controlling\nControl is an indispensable function of management. Without control the best of plans can go awry. A good control system helps an organisation in the following ways:\n (i) Accomplishing organisational goals: The controlling function measures progress towar\nds the \norganisational goals and brings to light the deviations, if any, and indicates corrective action. It, thus, guides the organisation and keeps it on the right track so that organisational goals might be achieved.\n (ii) Judging accuracy of standards: A good control system enables management to verify whether the standards set are accurate and objective. An efficient control system \nkeeps a careful check \non the changes taking place in the organisation and in the environment and helps to review and revise the standards in light of such changes.\nManagerial Control implies the measurement of accomplishment against the standard and the correction of deviations to assure attainment of objectives according to plans.\nKoontz and O’ Donnel\nCh_08.indd   202 08-08-2022   16:39:15\nReprint 2024-25"

Each activity is performed in accordance with predetermined standards and norms. This ensures that resources are used in the most effective and efficient manner.\n (iv) Improving employee motivation: A good co\nntrol system ensures \nthat employees know well in advance what they are expected to do and what are the standards of performance on the basis of which they will be appraised. It, thus, motivates them and helps them to give better performance.\n (v) Ensuring order and discipline:  Controlling creates an \natmosphere \nof order and discipline in the organisation. It helps to minimise dishonest behaviour on the part of the employees by keeping a close check on their activities. The box explains how an import-export company was able to track dishonest employees by using computer monitoring as a part of their control system.\n (vi) Facilitating coordination in action: Cont\nrolling provides \ndirection to all activities and  \nefforts for achieving organisational goals. Each department and employee is governed by pre\n-\ndetermined standards which are well coor\ndinated with one \nanother. This ensures that overall organisational objectives are accomplished.\nLimitations of Controlling\nAlthough controlling is an important function of management, it suffers from the following limitations.\n (i) Difficulty in setting quantitative standards: Control system loses so\nme of its effectiveness when \nstandards cannot be defined in \nManagers at a New York City import-export company suspected that two employees were robbing it. Corporate Defense Strategies (CDS) of Maywood, New Jersey, advised the firm to install a software program that could secretly log every single stroke of the suspects’ computer keys and send an encrypted e-mail report to CDS. Investigators revealed that the two employees were deleting orders from the corporate books after processing them, pocketing the revenues, and building their own company from within. The programme picked up on their plan to return to the office late one night to steal a large shipment of electronics. Police hid in the rafters of the firm’s warehouse, and when the suspects entered, they were arrested. The pair was charged with embezzling $3 million over two and a half years, a sizable amount of revenue for a $25 million-a-year firm.\nSource: Hellriegel Don, Susan E. Jackson and John W.

Employee morale, job satisfaction and human behaviour are such areas where this problem might arise.\n (ii) Little  control on external factors:  Generally an enterprise cannot control external factors such as government policies, technological changes,  competition etc.\n (iii) Resistance from employees: \nControl is often resisted \nby \nemployees. They see it as a restriction on their freedom. For instance, employees might object when they are kept under a strict watch with the help of Closed Circuit Televisions (CCTVs).\n (iv) Costly affair: Control is a costly affair as it involves a lot of expenditure, time and ef\nfort. A \nsmall enterprise cannot afford to install an expensive control system. It cannot justify the expenses involved. Managers must ensure that the costs of installing and operating a control system should not exceed the benefits derived from it.\nThe box on Control System at \nFedEx gives an overview of the control system used by FedEx and how it helped FedEx to increase its profits.\nRemain level headed  even when things go wrong\nCh_08.indd   204 08-08-2022   16:39:16\nReprint 2024-25"

A system of control presupposes the existence of certain standards. These standards of performance which serve as the basis of controlling are provided by planning. Once a plan becomes operational, controlling is necessary to monitor the progress, measure it, discover deviations and initiate corrective measures to ensure that events conform to plans. Thus,  \nplanning without controlling is meaningless. Similarly, controlling is blind without planning. If the standards are not set in advance, managers have nothing to control. When there is no plan, there is no basis of controlling. \nPlanning is clearly a prerequisite \nfor controlling. It is utterly foolish to think that controlling could be accomplished without planning. Without planning there is no predetermined understanding of the desired performance. Planning seeks consistent, integrated and articulated programmes while controlling seeks  \nto compel events to conform to plans.\nPlanning is basically an intellectual \nprocess involving thinking, articulation and analysis to discover and prescribe an appropriate course of action for achieving objectives. Controlling, on the other hand, checks whether decisions have been translated into desired action. Planning is thus, \nprescriptive whereas, controlling is evaluative.\nIt is often said that planning is looking \nahead while controlling is looking back. However, the statement is only partially correct. Plans are prepared for future and are based on forecasts about future conditions. Therefore, planning involves looking ahead and is called a forward-looking function. On the contrary, controlling is like a postmortem of past activities to find out deviations from the standards. In that sense, controlling is a backward-looking function. However, it should be understood that planning is guided by past experiences and the corrective action initiated by control function aims to improve future performance. Thus, planning and controlling are both backward-looking as well as a forward-looking function.\nThus, planning and controlling are \ninterrelated and, in fact, reinforce each other in the sense that\n 1. Planning based on facts makes controlling easier and effective; and\n 2. Controlling improves future planning by providing infor\nmation \nderived from past experience.\nControlling Process\nControlling is a systematic process involving the following steps.\n 1.

Taking corrective action\nStep 1: Setting Performance Stan­\ndards: The first step in the contr\nolling \nprocess is setting up of performance standards. Standards are the criteria against which actual performance would be measured. Thus, standards serve as benchmarks towards which an organisation strives to work.\nStandards can be set in both \nquantitative as well as qualitative terms. For instance, standards set  \nin terms of cost to be incurred, revenue to be earned, product units to be produced and sold, time to be spent in performing a task, all represents quantitative standards. Sometimes standards may also be set in qualitative terms. Improving goodwill and motivation level of employees are examples of qualitative standards. The table in the next page gives a glimpse of standards used in different functional areas of business to gauge performance.\nAt the time of setting standards, a \nmanager should try to set standards in precise quantitative terms as this would make their comparison with actual performance much easier. For instance, reduction of defects from 10 in every 1,000 pieces produced to 5 in every 1,000 pieces produced by the end of the quarter. However, whenever qualitative standards are set, an effort must be made to define them \nin a manner that would make their measurement easier. For instance, for improving customer satisfaction in a fast food chain having self-service, standards can be set in terms of time taken by a customer to wait for a table, time taken by him to place the order and time taken to collect the order.\nIt is important that standards \nshould be flexible enough to be modified whenever required. Due to changes taking place in the internal and external business environment, standards may need some modification to be realistic in the changed business environment.Step 2: Measurement of Actual Performance: Once performance \nstandards are set, the next step is measurement of actual performance. Performance should be measured in an objective and reliable manner. There are several techniques for measurement of performance. These include personal observation, sample checking, performance reports, etc. As far as possible, performance should be measured in the same units in which standards are set as this would make their comparison easier.\nIt is generally believed that \nmeasurement should be done after the task is completed. However, wherever possible, measurement of work should be done during the \nperformance. For instance, in case of assembling task, each part produced \nCh_08.indd   206 08-08-2022   16:39:16\nReprint 2024-25"

Measurement of a company’s performance may involve calculation of certain ratios like gross profit ratio, net profit ratio, return on investment, etc., at periodic intervals. \nProgress \nof work in certain operating areas like marketing may be measured by considering the number of units sold, increase in market share, etc., whereas, efficiency of production may be measured by counting the number of pieces produced and number of defective pieces in a batch. In small organisations, each piece produced may be checked to ensure that it conforms to quality specifications laid down for the product. \nHowever, this might not \nbe possible in a large organisation. Thus, in large organisations, certain pieces are checked at random for quality. This is known as sample checking.Step 3: Comparing Actual Per­formance with Standards: This step involves comparison of actual performance with the standard. Such comparison will reveal the deviation between actual and desired results. Comparison becomes easier when standards are set in quantitative terms. For instance, performance of a worker in terms of units produced in a week can be easily measured against the standard output for the week.\nStep 4: Analysing Deviations: \nSome deviation in performance can be expected in all activities. It is, \ntherefore, important to determine the acceptable range of deviations. Also, deviations in key areas of business \nneed to be attended more urgently \nas compared to deviations in certain insignificant areas.

It saves the time and efforts of managers as they deal with only significant deviations.\n2. It focuses managerial attention on important areas. Thus, there is better utilisation of managerial talent.\n3.\n The routine problems are left to \nthe subordinates. Management by exception, thus, \nfacilitates delegation of authority and increases morale of the employees.\n4. It identifies critical problems which need timely action to \nkeep the organisation in right \ntrack.Advantages of Critical Point Control and Management by Exceptionsignificant deviations which go beyond the permissible limit should be brought to the notice of management. Thus, if the plans lay down 2 per cent increase in labour cost as an acceptable range of deviation in a manufacturing organisation, only increase in labour cost beyond 2 per cent should be brought to the notice of the management. However, in case of major deviation from the standard (say, 5 per cent), the matter has to receive immediate action of management on a priority basis.\nThe box below highlights the \nadvantages of critical point control \nand management by exception.\nAfter identifying the deviations that \ndemand managerial attention, these deviations need to be analysed for their causes. Deviations may have multiple causes for their origin. These include unrealistic standards, defective \nprocess, inadequacy of resources, \nstructural drawbacks, organisational constraints and environmental factors control and management by exception \nshould be used by a manager in this regard.\n 1. Critical Point Control: It is neither economical nor easy to keep a check on each and every activity in an organisation. Contr\nol \nshould, therefore, focus on key result areas (KRAs) which are critical to the success of an organisation. These KRAs are set as the critical points. If anything goes wrong at the critical points, the entire organisation suffers. For instance, in a manufacturing organisation, an increase of  \n5 per cent in the labour cost may be more troublesome than a 15 per cent increase in postal charges.\n 2. Management by Exception: Manag\nement by exception, which \nis often referred to as control by exception, is an important principle of management control based on the belief that an attempt to control everything results in controlling nothing. Thus, only \nCh_08.indd   208 08-08-2022   16:39:16\nReprint 2024-25"

The deviations and their causes are then reported and corrective action taken at appropriate level.\nStep 5: Taking Corrective Action: The final step in the controlling process is taking corrective action. No corrective action is required when \nthe deviations are within acceptable limits. However, when the deviations \ngo beyond the acceptable range, especially in the important areas, it demands immediate managerial attention so that deviations do not occur again and standards are \naccomplished.\nCorrective action might involve \ntraining of employees if the production target could not be met. Similarly, if an important project is running behind schedule, corrective action might involve assigning of additional \nworkers and equipment to the project and permission for overtime work. In case the deviation cannot be corrected through managerial action, the standards may have to be revised. The table below cites some of the causes of deviations and the respective corrective action that might be taken by a manager.\nThe information in the box in next page \ngives an account of how Saco Defense was able to control a crisis situation.\nRemedial Plan of Action:  \nAnalysing deviations\nCh_08.indd   209 08-08-2022   16:39:18\nReprint 2024-25"

Controlling also helps in judging accuracy of standards, ensuring ef\nficient utilization of \nresources, boosting employee morale, creating an atmosphere of order and discipline in the organisation and coordinating different activities so that they all work together in one direction to meet targets.\nn Controlling suffers from certain limitations also. An organisation has no control over external factors. The control system of an organisation may face r\nesistance from its employees. Sometimes \ncontrolling turns out to be a costly affair, especially in case of small organisations. Moreover, it is not always possible for the management to set quantitative standards of performance in the absence of which controlling exercise loses some of its effectiveness.\nn The process of control involves setting performance standards, measurement of actual perfor\nmance, comparison of actual \nperformance with standards, analysis of deviations and taking corrective action.\nn Planning and controlling are inseparable twins of management.
