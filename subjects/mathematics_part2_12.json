BRISTOL /xrhombus\n7.1  Introduction\nDifferential Calculus is centred on the concept of the\nderivative. The original motivation for the derivative was\nthe problem of defining tangent lines to the graphs of\nfunctions and calculating the slope of such lines. Integral\nCalculus is motivated by the problem of defining and\ncalculating the area of the region bounded by the graph of\nthe functions.\nIf a function f  is differentiable in an interval I, i.e., its\nderivative f′exists at each point of I, then a natural question\narises that given f′at each point of I, can we determine\nthe function? The functions that could possibly have given\nfunction as a derivative are called anti derivatives (or\nprimitive) of the function. Further , the formula that gives\nall these anti derivatives is called the indefinite integral  of the function and such\nprocess of finding anti derivatives is called integration. Such type of problems arise in\nmany practical situations. For instance, if we know the instantaneous velocity of an\nobject at any instant, then there arises a natural question, i.e., can we determine the\nposition of the object at any instant? There are several such practical and theoretical\nsituations where the process of integration is involved. The development of integral\ncalculus arises out of the efforts of solving the problems of the following types:\n(a) the problem of finding a function whenever its derivative is given,\n(b) the problem of finding the area bounded by the graph of a function under certain\nconditions.\nThese  two problems lead to the two forms of the integrals, e.g., indefinite and\ndefinite integrals, which together constitute the Integral Calculus .Chapter 7\nINTEGRALS\nG .W.

                "text": "226 MATHEMA TICS\nThere is a connection, known as the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus , between\nindefinite integral and definite integral which makes the definite integral as a practical\ntool for science and engineering. The definite integral is also used to solve many interesting\nproblems from various disciplines like economic s, finance and probability .\nIn this Chapter , we shall confine ourselves to the study of indefinite and definite\nintegrals and their elementary properties including some techniques of integration.\n7.2  Integration as an Inverse Process of Differentiation\nIntegration is the inverse process of differentiation. Instead of differentiating a function,\nwe are given the derivative of a function and asked to find its primitive, i.e., the original\nfunction. Such a process is called integration  or anti differ entiation .\nLet us consider the following examples:\nWe know that (sin )dxdx =cos x ... (1)\n3\n( )3d x\ndx =x2... (2)\nand ( )xdedx=ex... (3)\nWe observe that in (1), the function cos x is the derived function of sin x. We say\nthat sin x is an anti derivative (or an integral) of cos x. Similarly , in (2) and (3), 3\n3x and\nex are the anti derivatives (or integrals) of x2 and ex, respectively . Again, we note that\nfor any real number C, treated as constant function, its derivative is zero and hence, we\ncan write (1), (2) and (3) as follows :\n(sin + C) cos =dx xdx, 3\n2( + C)3=d xxdxand ( + C) =x x de edx\nThus, anti derivatives (or integrals) of the above cited functions are not unique.\nActually , there exist infinitely many anti derivatives of each of these functions which\ncan be obtained by choosing C arbitrarily from the set of real numbers. For this reason\nC is customarily referred to as arbitrary constant . In fact, C is the parameter  by\nvarying which one gets different anti derivatives (or integrals) of the given function.\nMore generally , if there is a function F such that F ( ) = ( )dx f xdx, ∀x ∈ I (interval),\nthen for any arbitrary real number C, (also called constant of integration )\n[ ]F ( ) + Cdxdx =f(x), x ∈ I\nReprint 2024-25"

In this\nsection, we shall study what is called definite integral of a function. The definite integral\nhas a unique value. A definite integral is denoted by ( )b\naf x dx∫, where a is called the\nlower limit of the integral and b is called the upper limit of the integral. The definite\nintegral is introduced either as the limit of a sum or if it has an anti derivative F in the\ninterval [a , b], then its value is the difference  between the values of F at the end\npoints, i.e., F (b) – F(a).\n7.8  Fundamental Theorem of Calculus\n7.8.1   Area function\nWe have defined ( )b\naf x dx∫ as the area of\nthe region bounded by the curve y = f(x),\nthe ordinates x = a and x = b and x-axis.

Then ( )x\naf x dx∫\nrepresents the area of the light shaded region\nin Fig 7.1 [Here it is assumed that f(x) > 0 for\nx ∈ [a, b], the assertion made below is\nequally true for other functions as well].\nThe area of this shaded region depends upon\nthe value of x.\nIn other words, the area of this shaded region is a function of x. We denote this\nfunction of x by A(x). We call the function A(x) as Area function  and is given by\nA(x) =∫( )x\naf x dx ...

Here, in this chapter , we shall study a specific\napplication of integrals to find the area under simple curves,\narea between lines and arcs of circles, parabolas and\nellipses (standard forms only).

Now ,\nwe consider the easy and intuitive way of\nfinding the area bounded by the curve\ny = f(x), x-axis and the ordinates x = a and\nx = b.

The greatest development of method of exhaustion in the early\nperiod was obtained in the works of Eudoxus (440 B.C.) and Archimedes\n(300 B.C.)\nSystematic approach to the theory of Calculus began in the 17th century .\nIn 1665, Newton began his work on the Calculus described by him as the theory\nof fluxions and used his theory in finding the tangent and radius of curvature at\nany point on a curve. Newton introduced the basic notion of inverse function\ncalled the anti derivative (indefinite integral) or the inverse method of tangents.\nDuring 1684-86, Leibnitz published an article in the Acta Eruditorum  which\nhe called Calculas summatorius , since it was connected with the summation of\na number of infinitely small areas, whose sum, he indicated by the symbol ‘ ∫’. In\n1696, he followed a suggestion made by J. Bernoulli and changed this article to\nCalculus integrali. This corresponded to Newton’ s inverse method of tangents.\nBoth Newton and Leibnitz adopted quite independent lines of approach which\nwas radically dif ferent. However , respective theories accomplished results that\nwere practically identical. Leibnitz used the notion of definite integral and what is\nquite certain is that he first clearly appreciated tie up between the antiderivative\nand the definite integral.\nConclusively , the fundamental concepts and theory of Integral Calculus and\nprimarily its relationships with Differential Calculus were developed in the work\nof P.de Fermat, I. Newton and G . Leibnitz at the end of 17th century . However ,\nthis justification by the concept of limit was only developed in the works of A.L.\nCauchy in the early 19th century . Lastly , it is worth mentioning the following\nquotation by Lie Sophie’ s:\n“It may be said that the conceptions of differential quotient and integral which\nin their origin certainly go back to Archimedes were introduced in Science by the\ninvestigations of Kepler , Descartes, Cavalieri, Fermat and Wallis .... The discovery\nthat differentiation and integration are inverse operations belongs to Newton\nand Leibnitz”.\n—/xrhombus/xrhombus/xrhombus/xrhombus/xrhombus—\nReprint 2024-25"

He went further in a very short time\nto the discovery of the ‘ method of solving a linear differ ential equation of the\nfirst-or der’. How surprising is it that all these methods came from a single man\nand that too within 25 years of the birth of differential equations!\nIn the old days, what we now call the ‘solution’ of a differential equation, was\nused to be referred to as ‘integral’ of the differential equation, the word being\ncoined by James Bernoulli (1654 - 1705) in 1690. The word ‘solution was first\nused by Joseph Louis Lagrange (1736 - 1813) in 1774, which was almost hundred\nyears since the birth of differential equations. It was Jules Henri Poincare\n(1854 - 1912) who strongly advocated the use of the word ‘solution’ and thus the\nword ‘solution’  has found its deserved place in modern terminology . The name of\nthe ‘method of separation of variables ’ is due to John Bernoulli (1667 - 1748),\na younger brother of James Bernoulli.\nApplication to geometric problems were also considered. It was again John\nBernoulli who first brought into light the intricate nature of differential equations.\nIn a letter to Leibnitz, dated May 20, 1715, he revealed the solutions of the\ndifferential equation\nx2 y″ = 2y,\nwhich led to three types of curves, viz., parabolas, hyperbolas and a class of\ncubic curves. This shows how varied the solutions of such innocent looking\ndifferential equation can be. From the second half of the twentieth century attention\nhas been drawn to the investigation of this complicated nature of the solutions of\ndifferential equations, under the heading ‘ qualitative analysis of differ ential\nequations’. Now-a-days, this has acquired prime importance being absolutely\nnecessary in almost all investigations.\nReprint 2024-25"

How should a football player hit\nthe ball to give a pass to another player of his team? Observe\nthat a possible answer to the first query may be 1.6 meters,\na quantity that involves only one value (magnitude) which\nis a real number . Such quantities are called scalars .\nHowever , an answer to the second query is a quantity (called\nforce) which involves muscular strength (magnitude) and\ndirection (in which another player is positioned). Such\nquantities are called vectors.  In mathematics, physics and\nengineering, we frequently come across with both types of\nquantities, namely , scalar quantities such as length, mass,\ntime, distance, speed, area, volume, temperature, work,\nmoney , voltage, density , resistance etc. and vector quantities like displacement, velocity ,\nacceleration,  force, weight, momentum, electric field intensity etc.\nIn this chapter , we will study some of the basic concepts about vectors, various\noperations on vectors, and their algebraic and geometric properties. These two type of\nproperties, when considered together give a full realisation to the concept of vectors,\nand lead to their vital applicability in various areas as mentioned above.\n10.2  Some Basic Concepts\nLet ‘l ’ be any straight line in plane or three dimensional space.

Thus, a directed line segment has magnitude as well as\ndirection.\nDefinition 1 A quantity that has magnitude as well as direction is called a vector .\nNotice that a directed line segment is a vector (Fig 10.1(iii)), denoted as  or\nsimply as , and read as ‘vector ’ or ‘vector ’.\nThe point A from where the vector  starts is called its initial point , and the\npoint B where it ends is called its terminal point .

An other algebraic\noperation which we intend to discuss regarding vectors is their product. We may\nrecall that product of two numbers is a number , product of two matrices is again a\nmatrix. But in case of functions, we may multiply them in two ways, namely ,\nmultiplication of two functions pointwise and composition of two functions. Similarly ,\nmultiplication of two vectors is also defined in two ways, namely , scalar (or dot)\nproduct where the result is a scalar , and vector (or cross) product where the\nresult is a vector . Based upon these two types of products for vectors, they have\nfound various applications in geometry , mechanics and engineering. In this section,\nwe will discuss these two types of products.\n10.6.1   Scalar (or dot) product of two vectors\nDefinition 2  The scalar product of two nonzero vectors , denoted by , isFig 10.18\nReprint 2024-25"

The germinal ideas of modern vector theory date from around 1800\nwhen Caspar Wessel (1745-1818) and Jean Robert Argand (1768-1822) described\nthat how a complex number a + ib  could be given a geometric interpretation with\nthe help of a directed line segment in a coordinate plane. William Rowen Hamilton\n(1805-1865) an Irish mathematician was the first to use the term vector for a\ndirected line segment in his book Lectur es on Quaternions (1853). Hamilton’ s\nmethod of quaternions (an ordered set of four real numbers given as:\nˆ ˆ ˆ ˆ ˆ ˆ , , , a bi cj dk i j k+ + +  following certain algebraic rules) was a solution to the\nproblem of multiplying vectors in three dimensional space. Though, we must\nmention here that in practice, the idea of vector concept and their addition was\nknown much earlier ever since the time of Aristotle (384-322 B.C.), a Greek\nphilosopher , and pupil of Plato (427-348 B.C.). That time it was supposed to be\nknown that the combined action of two or more forces could be seen by adding\nthem according to parallelogram law . The correct law for the composition of\nforces, that forces add vectorially , had been discovered in the case of perpendicular\nforces by S tevin-Simon (1548-1620). In 1586 A.D., he analysed the principle of\ngeometric addition of forces in his treatise DeBeghinselen der W eeghconst\n(“Principles of the Art of Weighing”), which caused a major breakthrough in the\ndevelopment of mechanics. But it took another 200 years for the general concept\nof vectors to form.\nIn the 1880, Josaih Willard Gibbs (1839-1903), an American physicist and\nmathematician, and Oliver Heaviside (1850-1925), an English engineer , created\nwhat we now know as vector analysis , essentially by separating the real ( scalar )\nReprint 2024-25"

In\nClass XI, we have studied linear inequalities and systems\nof linear inequalities in two variables and their solutions by\ngraphical method. Many applications in mathematics\ninvolve systems of inequalities/equations. In this chapter ,\nwe shall apply the systems of linear inequalities/equations\nto solve some real life problems of the type as given below:\nA furniture dealer deals in only two items–tables and\nchairs. He has Rs 50,000 to invest and has storage space\nof at most 60 pieces. A table costs Rs 2500 and a chair\nRs 500. He estimates that from the sale of one table, he\ncan make a profit of Rs 250 and that from the sale of one\nchair a profit of Rs 75. He wants to know how many tables and chairs he should buy\nfrom the available money so as to maximise his total profit, assuming that he can sell all\nthe items which he buys.\nSuch type of problems which seek to maximise (or , minimise) profit (or , cost) form\na general class of problems called optimisation problems . Thus, an optimisation\nproblem may involve finding maximum profit, minimum cost, or minimum use of\nresources etc.\nA special but a very important class of optimisation problems is linear programming\nproblem.  The above stated optimisation problem is an example of linear programming\nproblem. Linear programming problems are of much interest because of their wide\napplicability in industry , commerce, management science etc.\nIn this chapter , we shall study some linear programming problems and their solutions\nby graphical method only , though there are many other methods also to solve such\nproblems.Chapter 12\nLINEAR PROGRAMMING\nL.

His profit in this case will be Rs (250 × 20), i.e., Rs 5000.\nSuppose he chooses to buy chairs only and no tables. With his capital of  Rs 50,000,\nhe can buy 50000 ÷ 500, i.e. 100 chairs. But he can store only 60 pieces. Therefore, he\nis forced to buy only 60 chairs which will give him a total profit of Rs (60 × 75), i.e.,\nRs 4500 .\nThere are many other possibilities, for instance, he may choose to buy 10 tables\nand 50 chairs, as he can store only 60 pieces. Total profit in this case would be\nRs (10 × 250 + 50 × 75), i.e., Rs 6250  and so on.\nWe, thus, find that the dealer can invest his money in dif ferent ways and he would\nearn different profits by following different investment strategies.\nNow the problem is : How should he invest his money in order to get maximum\nprofit? To answer this question, let us try to formulate the problem mathematically .\n12.2.1 Mathematical formulation of the problem\nLet x be the number of tables and y be the number of chairs that the dealer buys.\nObviously , x and y must be non-negative, i.e.,\n0 ...

Every point of this\nregion is called a feasible solution  to the pro blem. Thus, we have,\nFeasible region The common region determined by all the constraints including\nnon-negative c onstraints x, y ≥ 0 of a linear programming problem is called the feasible\nregion  (or solution region) for the problem. In Fig 12.1, the region OABC (shaded) is\nthe feasible region for the problem.

In\nFig 12.1, every point within and on the\nboundary of the feasible region OABC\nrepresents feasible solution to the problem.\nFor example, the point (10, 50) is a feasible\nsolution of the problem and so are the points\n(0, 60), (20, 0) etc.\nAny point outside the feasible region is\ncalled an  infeasible solution.

To handle this situation, we use the following theorems which are\nfundamental in solving linear programming problems.

However , if it exists, it must occur at a corner point of R.\n(By Theorem 1).\nIn the above example, the corner points (vertices) of the bounded (feasible) region\nare: O, A, B and C and it is easy to find their coordinates as (0, 0), (20, 0), (10, 50) and\n(0, 60) respectively .

PEIRCE  /xrhombus\n13.1  Introduction\nIn earlier Classes, we have studied the probability as a\nmeasure of uncertainty of events in a random experiment.\nWe discussed the axiomatic approach formulated by\nRussian Mathematician, A.N. Kolmogorov (1903-1987)\nand treated probability as a function of outcomes of the\nexperiment. We have also established equivalence between\nthe axiomatic theory and the classical theory of probability\nin case of equally likely outcomes. On the basis of this\nrelationship, we obtained probabilities of events associated\nwith discrete sample spaces. We have also studied the\naddition rule of probability . In this chapter , we shall discuss\nthe important concept of conditional probability of an event\ngiven that another event has occurred, which will be helpful\nin understanding the Bayes' theorem, multiplication rule of\nprobability and independence of events. We shall also learn\nan  important concept of  random variable and its probability\ndistribution and also the mean and variance of a probability  distribution. In the last\nsection of the chapter , we shall study an important discrete probability distribution\ncalled  Binomial distribution. Throughout this chapter , we shall take up the experiments\nhaving equally likely outcomes, unless stated otherwise.\n13.2  Conditional Probability\nUptill now in probability , we have discussed the methods of finding the probability of\nevents. If we have two events from the same sample space, does the information\nabout the occurrence of one of the events affect the probability of the other event? Let\nus try to answer this question by taking up a random experiment in which the outcomes\nare equally likely to occur .\nConsider the experiment of tossing three fair coins. The sample space of the\nexperiment is\nS = {HHH, HHT , HTH, THH, HTT , THT, TTH, TTT}Chapter 13\nPROBABILITY\nPierre de Fermat\n(1601-1665)\nReprint 2024-25"

Let\nE be the event ‘at least two heads appear ’ and  F be the event ‘first coin shows tail’.\nThen\nE ={HHH, HHT , HTH, THH}\nand F ={THH, THT, TTH, TTT}\nTherefore P(E) = P ({HHH}) + P ({HHT}) + P ({HTH}) + P ({THH})\n=1 1 1 1 1\n8 8 8 8 2+ + + =  (Why ?)\nand P(F) = P ({THH}) + P ({THT}) + P ({TTH}) + P ({TTT})\n=1 1 1 1 1\n8 8 8 8 2+ + + =\nAlso E ∩ F ={THH}\nwith P(E ∩ F) = P({THH}) = 1\n8\nNow , suppose we are given that the first coin shows tail, i.e. F occurs, then what is\nthe probability of occurrence of E? With the information of occurrence of F , we are\nsure that the cases in which first coin does not result into a tail should not be considered\nwhile finding the probability of E. This information reduces our sample space from the\nset S to its subset F for the event E. In other words, the additional information really\namounts to telling us that the situation may be considered as being that of a new\nrandom experiment for which the sample space consists of all those outcomes only\nwhich are favourable to the occurrence of the event F .\nNow , the sample point of F which is favourable to event E is THH.\nThus, Probability of E considering F as the sample space = 1\n4,\nor Probability of E given that the event F has occurred = 1\n4\nThis probability of the event E is called the conditional pr obability of E given\nthat F has alr eady occur red, and is denoted by P  (E|F).\nThus P(E|F) =1\n4\nNote that the elements of F which favour the event E are the common elements of\nE and F , i.e. the sample points of E ∩ F.\nReprint 2024-25"

The probability of event EF is obtained\nby using the conditional probability as obtained below :\nWe know that the conditional probability of event E given that F has occurred is\ndenoted by P(E|F) and is given by\nP(E|F) =P(E F),P(F) 0P(F)∩≠\nFrom this result, we can write\nP(E ∩ F) = P(F) . P(E|F) ... (1)\nAlso, we know that\nP(F|E) =P(F E),P(E) 0P(E)∩≠\nor P(F|E) =P(E F)\nP(E)∩ (since E ∩ F = F ∩ E)\nThus, P(E ∩ F) = P(E). P(F|E) .... (2)\nCombining (1) and (2), we find that\nP(E ∩ F) = P(E) P(F|E)\n=P(F) P(E|F) provided P(E) ≠ 0 and P(F) ≠ 0.\nThe above result is known as the multiplication r ule of pr obability .\nLet us now take up an example.\nExample 8  An urn contains 10 black and 5 white balls. Two balls are drawn from the\nurn one after the other without replacement. What is the probability that both drawn\nballs are black?\nSolution Let E and F denote respectively the events that first and second ball drawn\nare black. We have to find P(E ∩ F) or P (EF).\nReprint 2024-25"

We can find the probability of selecting any of the bags (i.e.1\n2) or probability of\ndrawing a ball of a particular colour (say white) from a particular bag (say Bag I). In\nother words, we can find the probability that the ball drawn is of a particular colour , if\nwe are given the bag from which the ball is drawn. But, can we find the probability that\nthe ball drawn is from a particular bag (say Bag II), if the colour of the ball drawn is\ngiven? Here, we have to find the reverse probability of Bag II to be selected when an\nevent occurred after it is known. Famous mathematician, John Bayes' solved the problem\nof finding reverse probability by using conditional probability. The formula developed\nby him is known as ‘Bayes theor em’ which was published posthumously in 1763.\nBefore stating and proving the Bayes' theorem, let us first take up a definition and\nsome preliminary results.\n13.5.1  Partition of a sample space\nA set of events E1, E2, ..., En is said to represent a partition of the sample space S if\n(a)Ei ∩ Ej = φ, i ≠ j, i, j = 1, 2, 3, ...,  n\nReprint 2024-25"

A treatise on gambling\nnamed liber de Ludo Alcae , by Geronimo Carden (1501-1576) was published\nposthumously in 1663. In this treatise, he gives the number of favourable cases\nfor each event when two  dice are thrown.\nGalileo (1564-1642) gave casual remarks concerning the correct evaluation\nof chance in a game of three dice. Galileo analysed that when three dice are\nthrown, the sum of the number that appear is more likely to be 10 than the sum 9,\nbecause the number of cases favourable to 10 are more than the number of\ncases for the appearance of number 9.\nApart from these early contributions, it is generally acknowledged that the\ntrue origin of the science of probability lies in the correspondence between two\ngreat men of the seventeenth century , Pascal (1623-1662) and Pierre de Fermat\n(1601-1665). A French gambler , Chevalier de Metre asked Pascal to explain\nsome seeming contradiction between his theoretical reasoning and the\nobservation gathered from gambling. In a series of letters written around 1654,\nPascal and Fermat laid the first foundation of science of probability . Pascal solved\nthe problem in algebraic manner while Fermat used the method of combinations.\nGreat Dutch Scientist, Huygens (1629-1695), became acquainted with the\ncontent of the correspondence between Pascal and Fermat and published a first\nbook on probability , \"De Ratiociniis in Ludo Aleae \" containing solution of many\ninteresting rather than difficult problems on probability in games of chances.\nThe next great work on probability theory is by Jacob Bernoulli (1654-1705),\nin the form of a great book, \" Ars Conjectendi \" published posthumously in 1713\nby his nephew , Nicholes Bernoulli. To him is due the discovery of one of the most\nimportant probability distribution known as Binomial distribution. The next\nremarkable work on probability lies in 1993. A. N. Kolmogorov (1903-1987) is\ncredited with the axiomatic theory of probability . His book, ‘Foundations of\nprobability’ published in 1933, introduces probability as a set function and is\nconsidered a ‘classic!’.\n—/xrhombus/xrhombus/xrhombus/xrhombus/xrhombus—\nReprint 2024-25"
