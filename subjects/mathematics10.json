We continue our discussion on real numbers in this chapter. Webegin with two very important properties of positive integers in Sections 1.2 and 1.3,namely the Euclid’s division algorithm and the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic.\nEuclid’s division algorithm, as the name suggests, has to do with divisibility of\nintegers. Stated simply, it says any positive integer a can be divided by another positive\ninteger b in such a way that it leaves a remainder r that is smaller than b. Many of you\nprobably recognise this as the usual long division process. Although this result is quiteeasy to state and understand, it has many applications related to the divisibility propertiesof integers. We touch upon a few of them, and use it mainly to compute the HCF oftwo positive integers.\nThe Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic, on the other hand, has to do something\nwith multiplication of positive integers. You already know that every composite numbercan be expressed as a product of primes in a unique way— this important fact is theFundamental Theorem of Arithmetic. Again, while it is a result that is easy to state andunderstand, it has some very deep and significant applications in the field of mathematics.\nWe use the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic for two main applications. First, we\nuse it to prove the irrationality of many of the numbers you studied in Class IX, such as\n2, 3  and 5. Second, we apply this theorem to explore when exactly the decimal\nexpansion of a rational number, say (0 )pqq , is terminating and when it is non-\nterminating repeating. We do so by looking at the prime factorisation of the denominator\nq of p\nq. You will see that the prime factorisation of q will completely reveal the nature\nof the decimal expansion of p\nq.\nSo let us begin our exploration.REAL NUMBERS\n2024-25"

For instance, 2 = 2, 4 = 2 × 2, 253 = 1 1 × 23, and so on.\nNow , let us try and look at natural numbers from the other direction. That is, can any\nnatural number be obtained by multiplying prime numbers? Let us see.\nTake any collection of prime numbers, say 2, 3, 7, 1 1 and 23. If we multiply\nsome or all of these numbers, allowing them to repeat as many times as we wish,\nwe can produce a large collection of positive integers (In fact, infinitely many).\nLet us list a few :\n7 × 1 1 × 23 = 1771 3 × 7 × 1 1 × 23 = 5313\n2 × 3 × 7 × 1 1 × 23 = 10626 23 × 3 × 73 = 8232\n22 × 3 × 7 × 1 1 × 23 = 21252\nand so on.\nNow , let us suppose your collection of primes includes all the possible primes.\nWhat is your guess about the size of this collection? Does it contain only a finite\nnumber of integers, or infinitely many? Infact, there are infinitely many primes. So,\nif we combine all these primes in all possible ways, we will get an infinite\ncollection of numbers, all\nthe primes and all possible\nproducts of primes. The\nquestion is – can we\nproduce all the composite\nnumbers this way? What\ndo you think? Do you\nthink that there may be a\ncomposite number which\nis not the product of\npowers of primes?\nBefore we answer this,\nlet us factorise positive\nintegers, that is, do the\nopposite of what we have\ndone so far .\nWe are going to use\nthe factor tree with which\nyou are all familiar .

                "text": "REAL NUMBERS 3\nCarl Friedrich Gauss\n(1777 – 1855)\nAn equivalent version of Theorem 1.2 was probably\nfirst recorded as Proposition 14 of Book IX in Euclid’s\nElements, before it came to be known as the\nFundamental Theorem of Arithmetic. However , the\nfirst correct proof was given by Carl Friedrich Gauss\nin his Disquisitiones Arithmeticae .\nCarl Friedrich Gauss is often referred to as the ‘Prince\nof Mathematicians’ and is considered one of the three\ngreatest mathematicians of all time, along with\nArchimedes and Newton. He has made fundamental\ncontributions to both mathematics and science.So we have factorised 32760 as 2 × 2 × 2 × 3 × 3 × 5 × 7 × 13 as a product of\nprimes, i.e., 32760 = 23 × 32 × 5 × 7 × 13 as a product of powers of primes. Let us try\nanother number , say, 123456789. This can be written as 32 × 3803 × 3607. Of course,\nyou have to check that 3803 and 3607 are primes! (T ry it out for several other natural\nnumbers yourself.)   This leads us to a conjecture that every composite number can be\nwritten as the product of powers of primes. In fact, this statement is true, and is called\nthe Fundamental Theor em of Arithmetic because of its basic crucial importance\nto the study of integers. Let us now formally state this theorem.\nTheor em 1.1  (Fundamental Theor em of Arithmetic) : Ever y composite\nnumber can be expr essed (factorise d) as a pr oduct of primes, and this factorisation\nis unique, apar t from the or der in which the prime factors occur .\nThe Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic says that every composite number can\nbe factorised as a product of primes. Actually it says more. It says that given any\ncomposite number it can be factorised as a product of prime numbers in a ‘unique’\nway, except for the order in which the primes occur . That is, given any composite\nnumber there is one and only one way to write it as a product of primes, as long as we\nare not particular about the order in which the primes occur . So, for example, we\nregard 2 × 3 × 5 × 7 as the same as 3 × 5 × 7 × 2, or any other possible order in which\nthese primes are written.  This fact is also stated in the following form:\nThe prime factorisation of a natural number is unique, except for the or der\nof its factors .\n2024-25"

                "text": "4M ATHEMA TICS\nIn general, given a composite number x, we factorise it as x  = p1p2 ... pn, where\np1, p2,..., pn are primes and written in ascending order, i.e., p1  p2\n . . .   pn. If we combine the same primes, we will get powers of primes. For example,\n32760 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 3 × 3 × 5 × 7 × 13 = 23 × 32 × 5 × 7 × 13\nOnce we have decided that the order will be ascending, then the way the number\nis factorised, is unique.\nThe Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic has many applications, both within\nmathematics and in other fields. Let us look at some examples.\nExample 1 :  Consider the numbers 4n, where n is a natural number. Check whether\nthere is any value of n for which 4n ends with the digit zero.\nSolution :  If the number 4n, for any n, were to end with the digit zero, then it would be\ndivisible by 5. That is, the prime factorisation of 4n would contain the prime 5. This is\nnot possible because 4n = (2)2n; so the only prime in the factorisation of 4n is 2. So, the\nuniqueness of the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic guarantees that there are no\nother primes in the factorisation of 4n. So, there is no natural number n for which 4n\nends with the digit zero.\nYou have already learnt how to find the HCF and LCM of two positive integers\nusing the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic in earlier classes, without realising it!This method is also called the prime factorisation method . Let us recall this method\nthrough an example.\nExample 2 :  Find the LCM and HCF  of 6 and 20 by the prime factorisation method.\nSolution :  We have : 6 = 2\n1 × 31and 20 = 2 × 2 × 5 = 22 × 51.\nYou can find HCF(6, 20) = 2 and LCM(6, 20) = 2 × 2 × 3 × 5 = 60, as done in your\nearlier classes.\nNote that HCF(6, 20) = 21 =Product of the smallest power of each common\nprime factor in the numbers.\nLCM (6, 20) = 22 × 31 × 51 =Product of the greatest power of each prime factor ,\ninvolved in the numbers .\nFrom the example above, you might have noticed that HCF(6, 20) × LCM(6, 20)\n= 6 × 20. In fact, we can verify that for any two positive integers a and b,\nHCF ( a, b) × LCM ( a, b) = a × b. We can use this result to find the LCM of two\npositive integers, if we have already found the HCF of the two positive integers.\nExample 3:  Find the HCF of 96 and 404 by the prime factorisation method.

You even studied how to locate irrationals on the number\nline. However , we did not prove that they were irrationals. In this section, we will\nprove that 2 , 3 , 5  and, in general, p is irrational, where p is a prime. One of\nthe theorems, we use in our proof, is the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic.\nRecall, a number ‘ s’ is called irrational if it cannot be written in the form  ,p\nq\nwhere p and q are integers and q ¹ 0. Some examples of irrational numbers, with\nwhich you are already familiar , are :\n2, 2, 3, 15, , 0.10110111011110 . . .\n3  , etc.\nBefore we prove that 2 is irrational, we need the following theorem, whose\nproof is based on the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic.\nTheor em 1.2 :  Let p be a prime number . If p divides a2, then p divides a, wher e\na is a positive integer .\n*Proof :  Let the prime factorisation of a be as follows :\na = p1p2 . . . pn, where p1,p2, . . ., pn are primes, not necessarily distinct.\nTherefore, a2 = (p1p2 . . . pn)(p1p2 . . . pn) = p2\n1p2\n2 . . . p2\nn.\nNow , we are given that p divides a2. Therefore, from the Fundamental Theorem of\nArithmetic, it follows that p is one of the prime factors of a2. However , using the\nuniqueness part of the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic, we realise that the only\nprime factors of a2 are p1, p2, . . ., pn. So p is one of p1, p2, . . ., pn.\nNow , since a = p1 p2 . . . pn, p divides a.\nWe are now ready to give a proof that 2 is irrational.\nThe proof is based on a technique called ‘proof by contradiction’. (This technique is\ndiscussed in some detail in Appendix 1).\nTheorem 1.3 :  2 is irrational.\nProof :  Let us assume, to the contrary , that 2 is rational.\n2024-25"

So, we write\n2x2 – 8x  + 6 = 2x2 – 6x – 2x + 6 = 2 x(x – 3) – 2( x – 3)\n=( 2x – 2)( x – 3) = 2( x – 1)( x – 3)\n2024-25"

This\nis sometimes more convenient than the substitution method. Let us see how this method\nworks.\nExample 8 :  The ratio of incomes of two persons is 9 : 7 and the ratio of their\nexpenditures is 4 : 3. If each of them manages to save ` 2000 per month, find their\nmonthly incomes.\nSolution :  Let us denote the incomes of the two person by ` 9x and ` 7x and their\nexpenditures by ` 4y and ` 3y respectively. Then the equations formed in the situation\nis given by :\n9x – 4y = 2000 (1)\nand 7 x – 3y = 2000 (2)\nStep 1 :  Multiply Equation (1) by 3 and Equation (2) by 4 to make the coef ficients of\ny equal. Then we get the equations:\n27x – 12 y =\n6000 (3)\n28x – 12 y = 8000 (4)\nStep 2 :  Subtract Equation (3) from Equation (4) to eliminate  y, because the coef ficients\nof y are the same. So, we get\n(28x – 27\nx) – (12 y – 12y ) = 8000 – 6000\ni.e., x = 2000\nStep 3 :  Substituting this value of x in (1), we get\n9(2000) – 4 y =2000\ni.e., y =\n4000\nSo, the solution of the equations is x = 2000, y = 4000. Therefore, the monthly incomes\nof the persons are ` 18,000 and ` 14,000, respectively.\nVerification :  18000 : 14000 = 9 : 7. Also, the ratio of their expenditures =\n18000 – 2000 : 14000 – 2000 = 16000 : 12000 = 4 : 3\nRemarks :\n1\n.

When we equate this polynomial\nto zero, we get a quadratic equation. Quadratic equations come up when we deal withmany real-life situations. For instance, suppose acharity trust decides to build a prayer hall havinga carpet area of 300 square metres with its lengthone metre more than twice its breadth. Whatshould be the length and breadth of the hall?Suppose the breadth of the hall is x metres. Then,\nits length should be (2 x + 1) metres. We can depict\nthis information pictorially as shown in Fig. 4.1.\nNow, area of the hall = (2 x + 1). x m\n2 = (2 x2 + x) m2\nSo, 2x2 + x = 300 (Given)\nTherefore, 2 x2 + x – 300 = 0\nSo, the breadth of the hall should satisfy the equation 2x2 + x – 300 = 0 which is a\nquadratic equation.\nMany people believe that Babylonians were the first to solve quadratic equations.\nFor instance, they knew how to find two positive numbers with a given positive sum\nand a given positive product, and this problem is equivalent to solving a quadraticequation of the form x\n2 – px + q = 0. Greek mathematician Euclid developed a\ngeometrical approach for finding out lengths which, in our present day terminology,are solutions of quadratic equations. Solving of quadratic equations, in general form, isoften credited to ancient Indian mathematicians. In fact, Brahmagupta (C.E.598–665)gave an explicit formula to solve a quadratic equation of the form ax\n2 + bx = c. Later,QUADRATIC  EQUATIONS\nFig. 4.1\n2024-25"

An  Arab mathematician Al-Khwarizmi (about C.E. 800) also studiedquadratic equations of different types. Abraham bar Hiyya Ha-Nasi, in his book‘Liber embadorum’ published in Europe in C.E. 1145 gave complete solutions ofdifferent quadratic equations.\nIn this chapter, you will study quadratic equations, and various ways of finding\ntheir roots. You will also see some applications of quadratic equations in daily lifesituations.\n4.2 Quadratic Equations\nA quadratic equation in the variable x is an equation of the form ax2 + bx + c = 0, where\na, b, c are real numbers, a  0. For example, 2 x2 + x – 300 = 0 is a quadratic equation.\nSimilarly, 2 x2 – 3x + 1 = 0, 4 x – 3x2 + 2 = 0 and 1 – x2 + 300 = 0 are also quadratic\nequations.\nIn fact, any equation of the form p(x) = 0, where p(x) is a polynomial of degree\n2, is a quadratic equation. But when we write the terms of p(x) in descending order of\ntheir degrees, then we get the standard form of the equation. That is, ax2 + bx + c = 0,\na  0 is called the standard form of a quadratic equation .\nQuadratic equations arise in several situations in the world around us and in\ndifferent fields of mathematics. Let us consider a few examples.\nExample 1 :  Represent the following situations mathematically:\n(i\n) John and Jivanti together have 45 marbles. Both of them lost 5 marbles each, and\nthe product of the number of marbles they now have is 124. We would like to find\nout how many marbles they had to start with.\n(ii) A cottage industry produces a certain number of toys in a day. The cost of\nproduction of each toy (in rupees) was found to be 55 minus the number of toysproduced in a day. On a particular day, the total cost of production was` 750. We would like to find out the number of toys produced on that day.\nSolution :\n(i) Let the number of marbles John had be x.\nThen the number of marbles Jivanti had = 45 – x (Why?).\nThe number of marbles left with John, when he lost 5 marbles = x – 5\nThe number of marbles left with Jivanti, when she lost 5 marbles = 45 – x – 5\n=40 – x\n2024-25"

If we replace x by 1 on the\nLHS of this equation, we get (2 × 12) – (3 × 1) + 1 = 0 = RHS of the equation.\nWe say that 1 is a root of the quadratic equation 2x2 – 3x + 1 = 0. This also means that\n1 is a zero of the quadratic polynomial 2 x2 – 3x + 1.\nIn general, a real number  is called a root of the quadratic equation\nax2 + bx + c = 0, a  0 if a 2 + b + c = 0. We also say that x =    is a solution of\nthe quadratic equation , or that    satisfies the quadratic equation . Note that  the\nzeroes of the quadratic polynomial ax2 + bx + c and the roots of the quadratic\nequation ax2 + bx + c = 0 are the same .\nYou have observed, in Chapter 2, that a quadratic polynomial can have at most\ntwo zeroes. So, any quadratic equation can have atmost two roots.\nYou have learnt in Class IX, how to factorise quadratic polynomials by splitting\ntheir middle terms. We shall use this knowledge for finding the roots of a quadratic\nequation. Let us see how.\nExample 3 :  Find the roots of the equation 2 x2 – 5x + 3 = 0, by factorisation.\nSolution :  Let us first split the middle term – 5 x as –2 x –3x [because (–2 x) × (–3 x) =\n6x2 = (2 x2) × 3].\nSo, 2x2 – 5x + 3 = 2 x2 – 2x – 3x + 3 = 2 x (x – 1) –3( x – 1) = (2 x – 3)(x  – 1)\nNow, 2 x2 – 5x + 3 = 0 can be rewritten as (2 x – 3)( x – 1) = 0.\nSo, the values of x for which 2 x2 – 5x + 3 = 0 are the same for which (2 x – 3)( x – 1) = 0,\ni.e., either 2 x – 3 = 0 or x – 1 = 0.\nNow, 2 x – 3 = 0 gives 3\n2x and x – 1 = 0 gives x = 1.\nSo, 32x\n and x = 1 are the solutions of the equation.\nIn other words, 1 and 32 are the roots of the equation 2 x2 – 5x + 3 = 0.\nVerify  that these are the roots of the given equation.\n2024-25"

Or, is it enough to know only the common difference?You will find that you will need to know both – the first term a and the common\ndifference d.\nFor instance if the first term a is 6 and the common difference d is 3, then\nthe AP is\n 6, 9,12, 15, . . .\nand if a is 6 and d is – 3, then the AP is\n6, 3, 0, –3, . . .\n2024-25"

He wrote :\nS = 1 + 2 + 3 + . . . + 99 + 100\nAnd then, reversed the numbers to write\nS = 100 + 99 + . . . + 3 + 2 + 1\nAdding these two, he got\n2S = (100 + 1) + (99 + 2) + . . . + (3 + 98) + (2 + 99) + (1 + 100)\n= 101 + 101 + . . . + 101 + 101 (100 times)\nSo, S =\n100 10150502 , i.e., the sum = 5050.\n2024-25"

These  figures appear to be similar but we cannot be\ncertain about it.Therefore, we must have some definition of similarity of figures andbased on this definition some rules to decide whether the two given figures are similaror not. For this, let us look at the photographs given in Fig. 6.3:\nFig. 6.3\nYou will at once say that they are the photographs of the same monument\n(T\naj Mahal) but are in different sizes. Would you say that the three photographs  are\nsimilar? Yes,they are.\nWhat can you say about the two photographs of the same size of the same\nperson one at the age of 10 years and the other at the age of 40 years? Are thesephotographs similar? These photographs are of the same size but certainly they arenot of the same shape. So, they are not similar.\nWhat does the photographer do when she prints photographs of different sizes\nfrom the same negative? You must  have heard about the stamp size, passport size andpostcard size photographs. She generally takes a photograph on a small size film, sayof 35mm size and then enlarges it into a bigger size, say 45mm (or 55mm). Thus, if weconsider any line segment in the smaller photograph (figure), its corresponding line\nsegment in the bigger photograph (figure) will be\n45\n3555or35\n of that of the line segment.\nThis really means that every line segment of the smaller photograph is enlarged\n(increased) in the ratio  35:45 (or 35:55).  It can also be said that every line segment\nof the bigger photograph is reduced (decreased) in the ratio 45:35 (or 55:35). Further,if you consider inclinations (or angles) between any pair of corresponding line segmentsin the two photographs of different sizes, you shall see that these inclinations(or angles)are always equal.  This is the essence of the similarity of two figures and in particular\nof two polygons. We say that:\nTwo polygons of the same number of sides are similar, if (i) their\ncorresponding angles are equal and (ii) their corresponding sides are in the\nsame ratio (or proportion ).\n2024-25"

You must have heard that\nworld maps (i.e., global maps) and blue prints for the construction of a building are\nprepared using a suitable scale factor and observing certain conventions.\nIn order to understand similarity of figures more clearly, let us perform the following\nactivity:\nActivity 1 :   Place a lighted bulb at a\npoint O on the ceiling  and directly below\nit a table in your classroom. Let us cut apolygon, say a quadrilateral ABCD, from\na plane cardboard and place thiscardboard parallel to the ground betweenthe lighted bulb  and the table.

This is because ofthe property of light that light propogatesin a straight line. You may also note thatA lies on ray OA, B  lies on ray OB, C \nlies on  OC and D  lies on OD.  Thus, quadrilaterals A BCD  and ABCD are of the\nsame shape but of different sizes.\nSo, quadrilateral  A BCD  is similiar to quadrilateral ABCD. We can also say\nthat quadrilateral ABCD is similar to the quadrilateral A BCD.\nHere, you can also note that vertex A  corresponds to vertex A, vertex B \ncorresponds to vertex B, vertex C  corresponds to vertex C and vertex  D  corresponds\nto vertex D. Symbolically, these correspondences are represented as A  A, B B,\nC C and D  D.

The distance of a point from the y-axis is called its\nx-coordinate , or abscissa . The distance of a point from the x-axis is called its\ny-coordinate , or ordinate . The coordinates of a point on the x-axis are of the form\n(x, 0), and of a point on the y-axis are of the form (0, y).\nHere is a play for you. Draw a set of a pair of perpendicular axes on a graph\npaper . Now plot the following points and join them as directed: Join the point A(4, 8) to\nB(3, 9) to C(3, 8) to D(1, 6) to E(1, 5) to F(3, 3) to G(6, 3) to H(8, 5) to I(8, 6) to\nJ(6, 8) to K(6, 9) to L(5, 8) to A. Then join the points P(3.5, 7), Q (3, 6) and R(4, 6) to\nform a triangle. Also join the points X(5.5, 7), Y(5, 6) and Z(6, 6) to form a triangle.\nNow join S(4, 5), T(4.5, 4) and U(5, 5) to form a triangle. Lastly join S to the points\n(0, 5) and (0, 6) and join U to the points (9, 5) and (9, 6). What picture have you got?\nAlso, you have seen that a linear equation in two variables of the form\nax + by + c = 0, ( a, b are not simultaneously zero), when represented graphically ,\ngives a straight line. Further , in Chapter 2, you have seen the graph of\ny = a\nx2 + bx + c (a ¹ 0), is a parabola. In fact, coordinate geometry has been developed\nas an algebraic tool for studying geometry of figures. It helps us to study geometry\nusing algebra, and understand algebra with the help of geometry . Because of this,\ncoordinate geometry is widely applied in various fields such as physics, engineering,\nnavigation, seismology and art!\nIn this chapter , you will learn how to find the distance between the two points\nwhose coordinates are given.

How would you find\nthe distance from town A to town B withoutactually measuring it. Let us see. This situationcan be represented graphically as shown in\nFig. 7.1. You may use the Pythagoras Theorem\nto calculate this distance.\nNow, suppose two points lie on the x-axis.\nCan we find the distance between them? Forinstance, consider two points A(4, 0) and B(6, 0)in Fig. 7.2. The points A and B lie on the x-axis.\nFrom the figure you can see that OA = 4\nunits and OB = 6 units.\nTherefore, the distance of B from A, i.e.,\nAB = OB – OA = 6 – 4 = 2 units.\nSo, if two points lie on the x-axis, we can\neasily find the distance between them.\nNow, suppose we take two points lying on\nthe y-axis. Can you find the distance between\nthem. If the points C(0, 3) and D(0, 8) lie on they-axis, similarly we find that CD = 8 – 3 = 5 units\n(see Fig. 7.2).\nNext, can you find the distance of A from C (in Fig. 7.2)? Since OA = 4 units and\nOC = 3 units, the distance of A from C, i.e., AC = \n2234  = 5 units. Similarly, you can\nfind the distance of B from D = BD = 10 units.\nNow, if we consider two points not lying on coordinate axis, can we find the\ndistance between them? Yes! We shall use Pythagoras theorem to do so. Let us see\nan example.\nIn Fig. 7.3, the points P(4, 6) and Q(6, 8) lie in the first quadrant. How do we use\nPythagoras theorem to find the distance between them? Let us draw PR and QSperpendicular to the x-axis from P and Q respectively. Also, draw a perpendicular\nfrom P on QS to meet QS at T. Then the coordinates of R and S are (4, 0) and (6, 0),respectively.  So, RS = 2 units. Also, QS = 8 units and TS = PR = 6 units.Fig. 7.1\nFig. 7.2\n2024-25"

Her motherrushes out of the house to look at theballoon.Now when the girl had spottedthe balloon intially it was at point A.When both the mother and daughtercame out to see it, it had alreadytravelled to another point B. Can youfind the altitude of B from the ground?\nIn all the situations given above, the distances or heights can be found by using\nsome mathematical techniques, which come under a branch of mathematics called‘trigonometry’. The word ‘trigonometry’ is derived from the Greek words ‘tri’(meaning three), ‘gon’ (meaning sides) and ‘metron’ (meaning measure). In fact,trigonometry  is the study of relationships between the sides and angles of a triangle.\nThe earliest known work on trigonometry was recorded in Egypt and Babylon. Earlyastronomers used it to find out the distances of the stars and planets from the Earth.Even today, most of the technologically advanced methods used in Engineering andPhysical Sciences are based on trigonometrical concepts.\nIn this chapter, we will study some ratios of the sides of a right triangle with\nrespect to its acute angles, called trigonometric ratios of the angle. We will restrict\nour discussion to acute angles only. However, these  ratios can be extended to otherangles also. We will also define the trigonometric ratios for angles of measure 0° and90°. We will calculate trigonometric ratios for some specific angles and establishsome identities involving these ratios, called trigonometric identities.\n8.2 Trigonometric Ratios\nIn Section 8.1, you have seen some right trianglesimagined to be formed in different situations.\nLet us take a right triangle ABC as shown\nin Fig. 8.4.\nHere,  CAB (or, in brief, angle A) is an\nacute angle. Note the position of the side BCwith respect to angle A. It faces  A. We call it\nthe side opposite to angle A. AC is the\nhypotenuse of the right triangle and the side AB\nis a part of  A. So, we call it the side\nadjacent to angle A.\nFig. 8.4Fig. 8.3\n2024-25"

Aryabhata used the word ardha-jya\nfor the half-chord, which was shortened to jya or\njiva in due course. When the Aryabhatiyam  was\ntranslated into Arabic, the word jiva was retained as\nit is. The word jiva was translated into sinus,  which\nmeans curve, when the Arabic version was translated\ninto Latin. Soon the word sinus , also used as sine,\nbecame common in mathematical texts throughoutEurope. An English Professor of astronomy EdmundGunter (1581–1626), first used the abbreviatednotation ‘sin’.\nThe origin of the terms ‘cosine’ and ‘tangent’ was much later. The cosine function\narose from the need to compute the sine of the complementary angle. Aryabhattacalled it kotijya . The name cosinus originated with Edmund Gunter. In 1674, the\nEnglish Mathematician Sir Jonas Moore first used the abbreviated notation ‘cos’.\nRemark :  Note that the symbol sin A\n  is used as an\nabbreviation for ‘the sine of the angle A’. sin A is  not\nthe product of ‘sin’ and A. ‘sin’ separated from Ahas no meaning. Similarly, cos A is  not the product of\n‘cos’ and A. Similar interpretations follow for othertrigonometric ratios also.\nNow, if we take a point P on the hypotenuse\nAC or a point Q on AC extended, of the right triangleABC and draw PM perpendicular to AB and QNperpendicular to AB extended (see Fig. 8.6), howwill the trigonometric ratios of  A in  PAM differ\nfrom those of  A in  CAB or from those of  A in\n QAN?\nTo answer this, first look at these triangles. Is  PAM similar to  CAB? From\nChapter 6, recall the AA similarity criterion. Using the criterion, you will see that thetriangles PAM and CAB are similar. Therefore, by the property of similar triangles,the corresponding sides of the triangles are proportional.\nSo, we have\nAM\nAB =AP MP\nAC BCAryabhata\n C.E. 476 – 550\nFig. 8.6\n2024-25"

But cosec A = (sin A)–1  sin–1 A (it is called sine\ninverse A). sin–1 A has a different meaning, which will be discussed in higher classes.\nSimilar conventions hold for the other trigonometric ratios as well. Sometimes, the\nGreek letter  (theta) is also used to denote an angle.\nWe have defined six trigonometric ratios of an acute angle. If we know any one\nof the ratios, can we obtain the other ratios? Let us see.\nIf in a right triangle ABC, sin A = 1,\n3\nthen this means that BC 1\nAC 3, i.e., the\nlengths of the sides BC and AC of the triangleABC are in the ratio 1 : 3 (see Fig. 8.7). So ifBC is equal to k, then AC will be 3 k, where\nk is any positive number. To determine other\ntrigonometric ratios for the angle A, we need to find the length of the third sideAB.

There can be three possibilities given\nin Fig. 10.1 below:\nFig. 10.1\nIn Fig. 10.1 (i), the line PQ and the circle have no common point.

Here the rope\non both sides of the pulley, if considered as a ray, is like a tangent\nto the circle representing the pulley.\nIs there any position of the line with respect to the circle\nother than the types given above? You can see that there cannotbe any other type of position of the line with respect  to the circle.In this chapter, we will study about the existence of the tangentsto a circle and also study some of their properties.\n10.2 Tangent to a Circle\nIn the previous section, you have seen that a tangent* to a circle is a line that\nintersects the circle at only one point .\nTo understand the existence of the tangent to a circle at a point, let us perform\nthe following activities:\nActivity 1 :  Take a circular wire and attach a straight wire AB at a point P of the\ncircular wire so that it can rotate about the point P in a plane. Put the system on a table\nand gently rotate the wire \nAB about the point P to get different positions of the straight\nwire [see Fig. 10.3(i)].\nIn various positions, the wire intersects the\ncircular wire at P and at another point Q1 or Q2 or\nQ3, etc. In one position, you will see that it will\nintersect the circle at the point P only (see position\nAB of AB). This shows that a tangent exists at\nthe point P of the circle. On rotating further, youcan observe that in all other positions of AB, it willintersect the circle at P and at another point, say R\n1\nor R2 or R3, etc. So, you can observe that there is\nonly one tangent at a point of the circle .\nWhile doing activity above, you must have observed that as the position AB\nmoves towards the position A  B, the common point, say Q1, of the line AB and the\ncircle gradually comes nearer and nearer to the common point P. Ultimately, it coincides\nwith the point P in the position A B of AB. Again note, what happens if ‘AB’ is\nrotated rightwards about P? The common point R3 gradually comes nearer and nearer\nto P and ultimately coincides with P. So, what we see is:\nThe tangent to a circle is a special case of the secant, when the two end\npoints of its corresponding chord coincide .Fig. 10.3 (i)Fig. 10.2\n*The word ‘tangent’ comes from the Latin word ‘tangere’, which means to touch and was\nintroduced by the Danish mathematician Thomas Fineke in 1583.\n2024-25"

In one case, itbecomes zero on one side of the secant and inanother case, it becomes zero on the other sideof the secant. See the positions P Q and PQ\nof the secant in Fig. 10.3 (ii).

Recall\nthat the portion (or part) of the circular region enclosed\nby two radii and the corresponding arc is called a\nsector of the circle and the portion (or part) of the\ncircular region enclosed between a chord and the\ncorresponding arc is called a segment of the circle.\nThus, in Fig. 1 1.1, shaded region OAPB is a sector\nof the circle with centre O. ∠ AOB is called the\nangle  of the sector . Note that in this figure, unshaded region OAQB is also a sector of\nthe circle. For obvious reasons, OAPB is called the minor sector and\nOAQB is called the major sector . You can also see that angle of the major sector is\n360° – ∠ AOB.\nNow , look at Fig. 1 1.2 in which AB is a chord\nof the circle with centre O. So, shaded region APB is\na segment of the circle. You can also note that\nunshaded region AQB is another segment of the circle\nformed by the chord AB. For obvious reasons, APB\nis called the minor segment and AQB is called the\nmajor segment .\nRemark :  \nWhen we write ‘segment’  and ‘sector ’\nwe will mean the ‘minor segment’ and the ‘minor\nsector ’ respectively , unless stated otherwise.AREAS RELATED TO CIRCLES\nFig. 1 1.2Fig. 1 1.1\n2024-25"

A test tube, right!\nYou would have used one in your science laboratory.This tube is also a combination of a cylinder and ahemisphere. Similarly, while travelling, you may haveseen some big and beautiful buildings or monumentsmade up of a combination of solids mentioned above.\nIf for some reason you wanted to find the\nsurface areas, or volumes, or capacities of suchobjects, how would you do it? We cannot classifythese under any of the solids you have already studied.\nIn this chapter, you will see how to find surface areas and volumes of such\nobjects.\n12.2 Surface Area of a Combination of Solids\nLet us consider the container seen in Fig. 12.2. How do we find the surface area ofsuch a solid? Now, whenever we come across a new problem, we first try to see, ifwe can break it down into smaller problems, we have earlier solved. We can see thatthis solid is made up of a cylinder with two hemispheres stuck at either end. It wouldlook like what we have in Fig. 12.4, after we put the pieces all together.\nFig. 12.4\nIf we consider the surface of the newly formed object, we would be able to see\nonly the curved surfaces of the two hemispheres and the curved surface of the cylinder .\nSo, the total surface area of the new solid is the sum of the curved surface\nareas of each of the individual parts. This gives,\nTSA of new solid = CSA of one hemisphere + CSA of cylinder\n                             \n+ CSA of other hemisphere\nwhere TSA, CSA stand for ‘Total Surface Area’ and ‘Curved Surface Area’\nrespectively.\nLet us now consider another situation. Suppose we are making a toy by putting\ntogether a hemisphere and a cone. Let us see the steps that we would be goingthrough.Fig. 12.3\n2024-25"

So, the steps would be as shownin Fig. 12.5.\nFig. 12.5\nAt the end of our trial, we have got ourselves a nice round-bottomed toy. Now if\nwe want to find how much paint we would require to colour the surface of this toy,\nwhat would we need to know? \nWe would need to know the surface area of the toy,\nwhich consists of the CSA of the hemisphere and the CSA of the cone.\nSo, we can say:\nTotal surface area of the toy = CSA of hemisphere + CSA of cone\nNow, let us consider some examples.\nExample 1 :  Rasheed got a playing top ( lattu) as his\nbirthday present, which surprisingly had no colour on\nit.

You have also learnt to represent the data pictoriallyin the form of various graphs such as bar graphs, histograms (including those of varyingwidths) and frequency polygons. In fact, you went a step further by studying certainnumerical representatives of the ungrouped data, also called measures of centraltendency, namely, mean , median  and mode . In this chapter, we shall extend the study\nof these three measures, i.e., mean, median and mode from ungrouped data to that ofgrouped data . We shall also discuss the concept of cumulative frequency, the\ncumulative frequency distribution and how to draw cumulative frequency curves, calledogives .\n13.2 Mean of Grouped Data\nThe mean (or average) of observations, as we know, is the sum of the values of all theobservations divided by the total number of observations. From Class IX, recall that ifx\n1, x2,. . ., xn are observations with respective frequencies f1, f2, . . ., fn, then this\nmeans observation x1 occurs f1 times, x2 occurs f2 times, and so on.\nNow, the sum of the values of all the observations = f1x1 + f2x2 + . . . + fnxn,  and\nthe number of observations = f1 + f2 + . . . + fn.\nSo, the mean x of the data is given by\nx =11 2 2\n12nn\nnfx fx fx\nff f \n\n\nRecall that we can write this in short form by using the Greek letter  (capital\nsigma) which means summation.

So, we need to convert given ungrouped\ndata into grouped data and devise some method to find its mean.\nLet us convert the ungrouped data of Example 1 into grouped data by forming\nclass-intervals of width, say 15. Remember that, while allocating frequencies to each\nclass-interval, students falling in any upper class-limit would be considered in the next\nclass, e.g., 4 students who have obtained 40 marks would be considered in the class-\ninterval 4 0-55 and not in 25-40. With this convention in our mind, let us form a grouped\nfrequency distribution table (see Table 13.2).\nTable 13.2\nClass interval 10 - 25\n25 - 40 40 -  55 55 -  70 70 - 85 85 - 100\nNumber of students 2 3 7\n6 6 6\nNow , for each class-interval, we require a point which would serve as the\nrepresentative of the whole class. It is assumed that the fr equency of each class-\ninter val is centr ed ar ound its mid-point . So the mid-point  (or class mark ) of each\nclass can be chosen to represent the observations falling in the class. Recall that we\nfind the mid-point of a class (or its class mark) by finding the average of its upper and\nlower limits. That is,\nClass mark =Upper class limit + Lower class limit\n2\nWith reference to Table 13.2, for the class 1 0-25, the class mark is 10 25\n2+, i.e.,\n17.5. Similarly , we can find the class marks of the remaining class intervals. We put\nthem in Table 13.3. These class marks serve as our xi’s. Now , in general, for the ith\nclass interval, we have the frequency fi corresponding to the class mark xi. We can\nnow proceed to compute the mean in the same manner as in Example 1.\n2024-25"

The difference in the\ntwo values is because of the mid-point assumption in Table 13.3, 59.3 being the exact\nmean, while 62 an approximate mean.\nSometimes when the numerical values of xi and fi are large, finding the product\nof xi and fi becomes tedious and time consuming. So, for such situations, let us think of\na method of reducing these calculations.\nWe can do nothing with the fi’s, but we can change each xi to a smaller number\nso that our calculations become easy . How do we do this? What about subtracting a\nfixed number from each of these xi’s? Let us try this method.\nThe first step is to choose one among the xi’s as the assumed mean , and denote\nit by ‘ a’. Also, to further reduce our calculation work, we may take ‘ a’ to be that xi\nwhich lies in the centre of x1, x2, . . ., xn. So, we can choose a = 47.5 or a = 62.5. Let\nus choose a = 47.5.\nThe next step is to find the dif ference di between a and each of the xi’s, that is,\nthe deviation  of ‘a’ from each of the xi’s.\ni.e., di =xi – a = xi – 47.5\n2024-25"

It also enables us to compare two or\nmore distributions. For example, by comparing the average (mean) results of students\nof different schools of a particular examination, we can conclude which school has abetter performance.\nHowever, extreme values in the data affect the mean. For example, the mean of\nclasses having frequencies more or less the same is a good representative of the data.\nBut, if one class has frequency, say 2, and the five others have frequency 20, 25, 20,\n21, 18, then the mean will certainly not reflect the way the data behaves. So, in suchcases, the mean is not a good representative of the data.\nIn problems where individual observations are not important, and we wish to find\nout a ‘typical’ observation, the median is more appropriate, e.g., finding the typical\nproductivity rate of workers, average wage in a country, etc. These are situations\nwhere extreme values may be there. So, rather than the mean, we take the median asa better measure of central tendency.\nIn situations which require establishing the most frequent value or most popular\nitem, the mode is the best choice, e.g., to find the most popular T.V . programme being\nwatched, the consumer item in greatest demand, the colour of the vehicle used by\nmost of the people, etc.\nRemarks :\n1.

Woodward\n14.1 Probability — A Theor etical Appr oach\nLet us consider the following situation :\nSuppose a coin is tossed at random .\nWhen we speak of a coin, we assume it to be ‘fair ’, that is, it is symmetrical so\nthat there is no reason for it to come down more often on one side than the other .\nWe call this property of the coin as being ‘unbiased’. By the phrase ‘random tos s’,\nwe mean that the coin is allowed to fall freely without any bias or interfer ence.\nWe know , in advance, that the coin can only land in one of two possible ways —\neither head up or tail up (we dismiss the possibility of its ‘landing’ on its edge, which\nmay be possible, for example, if it falls on sand). We can reasonably assume that each\noutcome, head or tail, is as likely to occur as the other . We refer to this by saying that\nthe outcomes  head and tail, are equally likely .\nFor another example of equally likely outcomes, suppose we throw a die\nonce. For us, a die will always mean a fair die. What are the possible outcomes?\nThey are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. Each number has the same possibility of showing up.

Let us see.\nSuppose that a bag contains 4 red balls and 1 blue ball, and you draw a ball\nwithout looking into the bag. What are the outcomes? Are the outcomes — a red ball\nand a blue ball equally likely? Since there are 4 red balls and only one blue ball, youwould agree that you are more likely to get a red ball than a blue ball. So, the outcomes(a red ball or a blue ball) are not equally likely. However, the outcome of drawing a\nball of any colour from the bag is equally likely. So, all experiments do not necessarilyhave equally likely outcomes.\nHowever, in this chapter, from now on, we will assume that all the experiments\nhave equally likely outcomes.\nIn Class IX, we defined the experimental or empirical probability P(E) of an\nevent E as\nP(E) = \nNumber of trials in which the event happened\nTotal number of trials\nThe empirical interpretation of probability can be applied to every event associated\nwith an experiment which can be repeated a large number of times. The requirement\nof repeating an experiment has some limitations, as it may be very expensive orunfeasible in many situations. Of course, it worked well in coin tossing or die throwingexperiments. But how about repeating the experiment of launching a satellite in orderto compute the empirical probability of its failure during launching, or the repetition ofthe phenomenon of an earthquake to compute the empirical probability of a multi-storeyed building getting destroyed in an earthquake?\nIn experiments where we are prepared to make certain assumptions, the repetition\nof an experiment can be avoided, as the assumptions help in directly calculating theexact (theoretical) probability. The assumption of equally likely outcomes (which isvalid in many experiments, as in the two examples above, of a coin and of a die) is onesuch assumption that leads us to the following definition of probability of an event.\nThe theoretical probability  (also called classical probability ) of an event E,\nwritten as P(E), is defined as\nP(E) = \nNumber of outcomes favourable to E\nNumber of all possible outcomes of the experiment,\nwhere we assume that the outcomes of the experiment are equally likely .\nWe will briefly refer to theoretical probability as probability.\nThis definition of probability was given by Pierre Simon Laplace in 1795.\n2024-25"
