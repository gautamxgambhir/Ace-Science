These\nproduction activities need various types\nof resources — natural resources, man-\nmade items, human effort, money, etc. As\nwe read through the story of Palampur ,\nwe will learn how various resources\ncombine to produce the desired goods and\nservices in the village.\nIntroduction\nPalampur is well-connected with\nneighbouring villages and towns. Raiganj,\na big village, is 3 kms from Palampur . An\nall weather road connects the village to\nRaiganj and further on to the nearest\nsmall town of Shahpur . Many kinds of\ntransport are visible on this road starting\nfrom bullock carts, tongas , bogeys (wooden\ncart drawn by buffalos) loaded with jaggery\n(gur) and other commodities to motor\nvehicles like motorcycles, jeeps, tractors\nand trucks.\nThis village has about 450 families\nbelonging to several different castes. The\n80 upper caste families own the majority\nof land in the village. Their houses, some\nof them quite large, are made of brick with\ncement plastering. The SCs (dalits)\ncomprise one third of the population and\nlive in one corner of the village and in\nmuch smaller houses some of which are\nof mud and straw. Most of the houses haveelectric connections. Electricity powers all\nthe tubewells in the fields and is used in\nvarious types of small business. Palampur\nhas two primary schools and one high\nschool. There is a primary health centre\nrun by the government and one private\ndispensary where the sick are treated.\n•The description above shows that\nPalampur has fairly well-developed\nsystem of roads, transport, electricity,\nirrigation, schools and health centre.\nCompare these facilities with those in\nyour nearby village.\nThe story of Palampur , an imaginary\nvillage, will take us through the different\ntypes of production activities in the\nvillage. In villages across India, farming\nis the main production activity. The other\nproduction activities, referred to as non-\nfarm activities include small\nmanufacturing, transport, shop-keeping,\netc. W e shall take a lo ok at both these\ntypes of activities, after learning a few\ngeneral things about production.The Story of Village PalampurThe Story of Village Palampur1\nChapter1\nPicture 1.1  Scene of a village\n*The narrative is partly based on a research study by G ilbert Etienne of a village in Bulandshahr district in W estern\nUttar Pradesh.\n2024-25"

                "text": "2   \n   EconomicsOrganisation of Production\nThe aim of production is to produce the\ngoods and services that we want. There\nare four requirements for production of\ngoods and services.\nThe first requirement is land , and\nother natural resources such as water ,\nforests, minerals.\nThe second requirement is labour , i.e.\npeople who will do the work. Some\nproduction activities require highly\neducated workers to perform the\nnecessary tasks. Other activities require\nworkers who can do manual work. Each\nworker is providing the labour necessary\nfor production.\nThe third requirement is physical\ncapital , i.e. the variety of inputs required\nat every stage during production. What\nare the items that come under physical\ncapital?\n(a) Tools, machines, buildings:  Tools and\nmachines range from very simple tools\nsuch as a farmer’s plough to\nsophisticated machines such as\ngenerators, turbines, computers, etc.\nTools, machines, buildings can be used\nin production over many years, and\nare called fixed capital.\n(b) Raw materials and money in hand:\nProduction requires a variety of raw\nmaterials such as the yarn used by\nthe weaver and the clay used by the\npotter . Also, some money is always\nrequired during production to make\npayments and buy other necessary\nitems. Raw materials and money in\nhand are called working capital .\nUnlike tools, machines and buildings,\nthese are used up in production.\nThere is a fourth requirement to o. You\nwill need knowledge and enterprise to be\nable to put together land, labour and\nphysical capital and produce an output\neither to use yourself or to sell in the\nmarket. This these days is called humancapital. W e shall learn more about human\ncapital  in the next chapter .\n•In the picture, identify the land, labour\nand fixed capital used in production.\nPicture 1.2 A factory, with several  labourers\nand  machines\nEvery production is organised by\ncombining land, labour , physical capital\nand human capital, which are known as\nfactors of production . As we read\nthrough the story of Palampur , we will\nlearn more about the first three factors\nof production. For convenience, we will\nrefer to the physical capital as the capital\nin this chapter .\nFarming in Palampur\n1.Land is fixed\nFarming is the main production activity\nin Palampur . 75 per cent of the people\nwho are working are dependent on\nfarming for their livelihood. They could\nbe farmers or farm labourers. The well-\nbeing of these people is closely related to\nproduction on the farms.\nBut remember that there is a basic\nconstraint in raising farm production.\nLand area under cultivation is practically\nfixed. Since 1960 in Palampur , there has\nbeen no expansion in land area under\n2024-25"

There exists\nno further scope to increase farm\nproduction by bringing new land under\ncultivation.larger areas of land more effectively. The\nfirst few tubewells were installed by the\ngovernment. So on, however , farmers\nstarted setting up private tubewells. As a\nresult, by mid-1970s the entire cultivated\narea of 200 hectares (ha.) was irrigated.\nThe standard unit of measuring land\nis hectare, though in the villages you\nmay find land area being discussed\nin local units such as bigha, guintha\netc. One hectare equals the area of a\nsquare with one side measuring 100\nmetres.  Can you compare the area of\na 1 hectare field with the area of your\nschool ground?\n2.Is there a way one can grow more\nfrom the same land?\nIn the kind of crops grown and facilities\navailable, Palampur would resemble a\nvillage of the western part of the state of\nUttar Pradesh. All land is cultivated in\nPalampur . No land is left idle. During the\nrainy season (kharif) farmers grow jowar\nand bajra. These plants are used as cattle\nfeed. It is followed by cultivation of potato\nbetwe en October and December . In the\nwinter season (rabi), fields are sown with\nwheat. From the wheat produced, farmers\nkeep enough wheat for the family’s\nconsumption and sell the surplus wheat\nat the market at Raiganj. A part of the\nland area is also devoted to sugarcane\nwhich is harvested once every year .\nSugarcane, in its raw form, or as jaggery,\nis sold to traders in Shahpur .\nThe main reason why farmers are able\nto grow three different crops in a year in\nPalampur is due to the well-developed\nsystem of irrigation. Electricity came early\nto Palampur . Its major impact was to\ntransform the system of irrigation.\nPersian wheels were, till then, used by\nfarmers to draw water from the wells and\nirrigate small fields. People saw that the\nelectric-run tubewells could irrigat e muchNot all villages in India have such\nhigh levels of irrigation.  Apart from\nthe riverine plains, coastal regions in\nour country are well-irrigated.  In\ncontrast, plateau regions such as the\nDeccan plateau have low levels of\nirrigation.  Of the total cultivated area\nin the country a little less than 40\nper cent is irrigated even today.  In\nthe remaining areas, farming is\nlargely dependent on rainfall.\nTo grow more than one crop on a piece of\nland during the year is known as multiple\ncropping. It is the most common way of\nincreasing production on a given piece of\nland. All farmers in Palampur grow\natleast two main crops; many are growing\npotato as the third crop in the past fifteen\nto twenty years.\nPicture 1.3  Different crops\n  Let’ s Discuss\n•The following Table1.1 shows the land\nunder cultivation in India in units of\nmillion hectares.

Unfortunately , not all\nthe people engaged in agriculture have\nsufficient land for cultivation. I n Palampur ,\nabout one third of the 450 families are\nlandless, i.e. 150 families, most of them\ndalits, have no land for cultivation.\nOf the remaining families who own\nsoil for long.

This means\nsome time after their use, the soil will\nbe less fertile than ever\nbefore.... (Source:  Down to Earth, New\nDelhi)\n.....The consumption of chemical\nfertilizers in Punjab is highest in the\ncountry. The continuous use of chemical\nfertilizers has led to degradation of soil\nhealth. Punjab farmers are now forced\nto use more and more chemical\nfertilizers and other inputs to achieve\nthe same production level. This means\ncost of cultivation is rising very\nfast..... (Sour ce: The T ribune,\nChandigarh)land, 240 families cultivate small plots\nof land less than 2 hectares in size.\nCultivation of such plots doesn’t bring\nadequate income to the farmer family.\nIn 1960, Gobind was a farmer with\n2.25 hectares of largely unirrigated\nland. With the help of his three sons\nGobind cultivated the land. Though\nthey didn’t live very comfortably, the\nfamily managed to feed itself with a\nlittle bit of extra income from one\nbuffalo that the family possessed.\nSome years after Gobind’s death, this\nland was divided among his three\nsons. Each one now has a plot of land\nthat is only 0.75 hectare in size. Even\nwith improved irrigation and modern\nfarming method, Gobind’s sons are\nnot able to make a living from their\nland. They have to look for additional\nwork during part of the year .\nYou can se e the large number of small\nplots scattered around the village in the\npicture. These are cultivated by the small\nfarmers. On the other hand, more than\nhalf the area of the village is covered by\nplots that are quite large in size. In\nPalampur , there are 60 families of medium\nand large farmers who cultivate more\nthan 2 hectares of land. A few of the large\nfarmers have land extending over 10\nhectares or more.\n2024-25"

Dala\ncomplains about his situation to Ramkali,\nwho is another farm labourer .\nBoth Dala and Ramkali are among the\npoorest people in the village.\n  Let’ s Discuss\n•Why are farm labourers like Dala and\nRamkali poor?\n•Gosaipur and Majauli are two villages\nin North Bihar . Out of a total of 850\nhouseholds in the two villages, there\nare more than 250 men who are\nemployed in rural Punjab and Haryana\nor in Delhi, Mumbai, Surat, Hyderabad\nor Nagpur . Such migration is common\nin most villages across India. Why do\npeople migrate? Can you describe\n(based on your imagination) the work\nthat the migrants of Gosaipur and\nMajauli might do at the place of\ndestination?\n6.The capital needed in farming\nYou ha ve already se en that the modern\nfarming methods require a great deal of\ncapital, so that the farmer now needs\nmore money than before.\n1.Most small farmers have to borrow\nmoney to arrange for the capital. They\nborrow from large farmers or the\nvillage moneylenders or the traders\nwho supply various inputs for\ncultivation. The rate of interest on\nsuch loans is very high. They are put\nto great distress  to repay the loan.\nSavita is a small farmer . She plans\nto cultivate wheat on her 1 hectare of\nland. Besides seeds, fertilizers and\npesticides, she needs cash to buy\nwater and repair her farm\ninstruments. She estimates that the\nworking capital itself would cost a\nminimum of Rs 3,000. She doesn’t\nhave the money, so she decides to\nborrow from Tejpal Singh, a largefarmer . Tejpal Singh agre es to give\nSavita the loan at an interest rate of\n24 per cent for four months, which is\na very high interest rate. Savita also\nhas to promise to work on his field as\na farm labourer during the harvest\nseason at Rs 100 per day. As you can\ntell, this wage is quite low. Savita\nknows that she will have to work very\nhard to complete harvesting on her\nown field, and then work as a farm\nlabourer for Tejpal Singh. The harvest\ntime is a very busy time. As a mother\nof three children she has a lot of\nhousehold responsibilities. Savita\nagrees to these tough conditions as\nshe knows getting a loan is difficult\nfor a small farmer .\n2.In contrast to the small farmers, the\nmedium and large farmers have their\nown savings from farming. They are\nthus able to arrange for the capital\nneeded. How do these farmers have\ntheir own savings? Y ou shall find the\nanswer in the next section.\n  Let's discuss the story so far ....\nWe have read about the thre e factors of\nproduction—land, labour and capital—\nand how they are used in farming. Let us\nfill in the blanks given below.\nAmong the three factors of production,\nwe found that labour is the most\nabundant factor of production. There are\nmany people who are willing to work as\nfarm labourers in the villages, whereas\nthe opportunities of work are limited. They\nbelong to either landless families or\n.

Small\nfarmers usually need to borrow money to\narrange for the capital, and are put to\ngreat distress to repay the loan. Therefore,\ncapital too is a scarce factor of production,\nparticularly for the small farmers.\nThough both land and capital are\nscarce, there is a basic difference between\nthe two factors of production.\n is a natural resource,\nwhereas  is man-made. It\nis possible to increase capital, whereas\nland is fixed. Therefore, it is very\nimportant that we take good care of land\nand other natural resources used in\nfarming.\n7.Sale of Surplus Farm Products\nLet us suppose that the farmers have\nproduced wheat on their lands using the\nthree factors of production. The wheat\nis harvested and production is complete.\nWhat do the farmers do with the wheat?\nThey retain a part of the wheat for the\nfamily’s consumption and sell the\nsurplus wheat. Small farmers like\nSavita and Gobind’s sons have little\nsurplus wheat because their total\nproduction is small and from this a\nsubstantial share is kept for their own\nfamily needs. So it is the medium and\nlarge farmers who supply wheat to the\nmarket. In the  Picture  1.1, you can see the\nbullock cart streaming into the market\neach carrying loads of wheat. The traders\nat the market buy the wheat and sell it\nfurther to shopkeepers in the towns and\ncities .Tejpal Singh, the large farmer , has a\nsurplus of 350 quintals of wheat from all\nhis lands! He sells the surplus wheat at\nthe Raiganj market and has good earnings.\nWhat does Tejpal Singh do with his\nearnings? L ast year , Tejpal Singh had put\nmost of the money in his bank account.\nLater he used the savings for lending to\nfarmers like Savita who were in need of a\nloan. He also used the savings to arrange\nfor the working capital for farming in the\nnext season. This year Tejpal Singh plans\nto use his earnings to buy another tractor .\nAnother tractor would increase his fixed\ncapital.\nLike Tejpal Singh, other large and\nmedium farmers sell the surplus farm\nproducts. A part of the earnings is saved\nand kept for buying capital for the next\nseason. Thus, they are able to arrange\nfor the capital for farming from their own\nsavings. Some farmers might also use the\nsavings to buy cattle, trucks, or to set up\nshops. As we shall see, these constitute\nthe capital for non-farm activities.\nNon-Farm Activities in Palampur\nWe have learnt about farming as the main\nproduction activity in Palampur . We shall\nnow take a look at some of the non-farm\nproduction activities. Only 25 per cent\nof the people working in Palampur are\nengaged in activities other than\nagriculture.\n1.Dairy — the other common\nactivity\nDairy is a common activity in many families\nof Palampur . People fe ed their buf falos on\nvarious kinds of grass and the jowar and\nbajra  that grows during the rainy season.\nThe milk is sold in Raiganj, the nearby large\nvillage. Two traders from Shahpur town\nhave set up collection cum chilling centres\nat Raiganj from where the milk is\ntransported to far away towns and cities.\n2024-25"

Once a week, he goes to\nthe river Gang a to bring back clay for\nthe potter . Or sometimes he goes to\nShahpur with a load of jaggery or other\ncommodities. Every month he gets some\nwork in transport. As a result, Kishora\nis able to earn more than what he used\nto do some years back.\n Summary\nFarming is the main production activity in the village. Over the years there have\nbeen many important changes in the way farming is practiced. These have allowed\nthe farmers to produce more crops from the same amount of land. This is an\nimportant achievement, since land is fixed and scarce. But in raising production\na great deal of pressure has been put on land and other natural resources.\nThe new ways of farming need less land, but much more of capital. The medium\nand large farmers are able to use their own savings from production to arrange\nfor capital during the next season. On the other hand, the small farmers who\nconstitute about 80 per cent of total farmers in India, find it difficult to obtain\ncapital. Because of the small size of their plots, their production is not enough.\nThe lack of surplus means that they are unable to obtain capital from their own\nsavings, and have to borrow. Besides the debt, many of the small farmers have\nto do additional work as farm labourers to feed themselves and their families.\nLabour being the most abundant factor of production, it would be ideal if\nnew ways of farming used much more labour . Unfortunately , such a thing has\nnot happened. The use of labour on farms is limited. The labour , looking for\nopportunities is thus migrating to neighbouring villages, towns and cities. Some\nlabour has entered the non-farm sector in the village.\nAt present, the non-farm sector in the village is not very large. Out of every\n100 workers in the rural areas in India, only 24 are engaged in non-farm activities.\nThough there is a variety of non-farm activities in the villages (we have only\nseen a few examples), the number of people employed in each is quite small.\nIn the future, one would like to see more non-farm production activities in the\nvillage. Unlike farming, non-farm activities require little land. People with some\namount of capital can set up non-farm activities. How does one obtain this capital?\nOne can either use his own savings, but more often has to take a loan. It is\nimportant that loan be available at low rate of interest so that even people without\nsavings can start some non-farm activity. Another thing which is essential for\nexpansion of non-farm activities is to have markets where the goods and services\nproduced can be sold. I n Palampur , we saw the neighbouring villages, towns and\ncities provide the markets for milk, jaggery, wheat, etc. As more villages get\nconnected to towns and cities through good roads, transport and telephone, it is\npossible that the opportunities for non-farm activities  in the village would increase\nin the coming years.\n2024-25"

Looking at the\npopulation from this productive aspect\nemphasises its ability to contribute to\nthe creation of the Gross National\nProduct. Like other resources population\nalso is a resource — a 'hum an resource '.\nThis is the positive side of a large\npopulation that is often overlooked when\nwe look only at the negative side,\nconsidering only the problems of\nproviding the population with food,\neducation and access to health facilities.\nWhen the existing 'human resource ' is\nfurther developed by becoming more\neducated and healthy, we call it 'human\ncapital formation ' that adds to the\nproductive power of the country just like\n'physical capital formation '.\nInvestment in human capital\n(through education, training, medical\ncare) yields a return just like investment\nin physical capital. This can be seen\ndirectly in the form of higher incomes\nearned because of higher productivity\nof the more educated or the better trained\npersons, as well as the higher\nproductivity of healthier people.People as Resource2\nChapter\nIndia’s Green Revolution is a\ndramatic example of how the input\nof greater knowledge in the form of\nimproved production technologies can\nrapidly increase the productivity of\nscarce land resources. India’s IT\nrevolution is a striking instance of\nhow the importance of human capital\nhas come to acquire a higher position\nthan that of material, plant and\nmachinery.\nSource : Planning Commission, Govt. of India.People as Resource2\n2024-25"

He also looked after\nhis younger brother Jeetu and sister\nSeetu. His uncle Shyam had passed\nthe matriculation examination, but,\nwas sitting idle in the house as he\nhad no job. Buta and Sheela were\neager to teach Sakal. They forced him\nto join the village school which he\nsoon joined. He started studying and\ncompleted his higher secondary\nexamination. His father persuaded\nhim to continue his studies. He raised\na loan for Sakal to study a vocational\ncourse in computers. Sakal was\nmeritorious and interested in studies\nfrom the beginning. With great vigour\nand enthusiasm he completed his\ncourse. After some time he got a job\nin a private firm. He even designed a\nnew kind of software.

His father passed away\nwhen he was only two years old. His\nmother Geeta sold fish to earn money\nto feed the family. She bought fish\nfrom the landowner’s pond and sold\nit in the nearby mandi . She could\nearn only Rs 150 a day by selling fish.\nVilas became a patient of arthritis.\nHis mother could not afford to take\nhim to the doctor . He could not go to\nschool either . He was not interested\nin studies. He helped his mother in\ncooking and also looked after his\nyounger brother Mohan. After some\ntime his mother fell sick and there\nwas no one to lo ok after her .

He spends\nhis life selling fish like his mother .\nHenceforth, he draws the same salary of\nunskilled labourer as his mother .\nInvestment in human resource (via\neducation and medical care) can give high\nrates of return in future. This investment\non people is the same as investment in\nland and capital.\nA child, too, with investments made\non her education and health, can yield\na high return in future in the form of\nhigher earnings and greater\ncontribution to the society. Educated\nparents are found to invest more heavily\non the education of their child. This is\nbecause they have realised the\nimportance of education for themselves.\nThey are also conscious of proper\nnutrition and hygiene. They accordingly\nlook after their children’s needs for\neducation at school and good health. A\nvirtuous cycle is, thus, created in this\ncase. In contrast, a vicious cycle may\nbe created by disadvantaged parents,\nwho themselves uneducated and lacking\nin hygiene, keep their children in a\nsimilarly disadvantaged state.\nCountries, like Japan, have invested\nin human resource. They did not have any\nnatural resource. These countries are\ndeveloped/rich. They import the natural\nresource needed in their country. How did\nthey become rich/developed?

Efficiency and the\ntechnology evolved by people have made\nthese countries rich/developed.Economic Activities by Men and W omen\nLike Vilas and Sakal, people have been\nengaged in various activities. W e saw that\nVilas sold fish and Sakal got a job in the\nfirm. The various activities have been\nclassified into three main sectors i.e.,\nprimary, secondary and tertiary. Primary\nsector includes agriculture, forestry,\nanimal husbandry, fishing, poultry\nfarming, mining and quarrying.\nManufacturing is included in the\nsecondary sector . Trade, transport,\ncommunication, banking, education,\nhealth, tourism, services, insurance, etc.\nare included in the tertiary sector . The\nactivities in this sector result in the\nproduction of goods and services. These\nactivities add value to the national\nincome. These activities are called\neconomic activities. Economic activities\nhave two parts — market activities and\nnon-market activities. Market activities\ninvolve remuneration to anyone who\nperforms i.e., activity performed for pay\nor profit.

Sakal’s grandparents\n(although not mentioned in the story)\ncannot be called unemployed.\nIn case of India we have unemployment\nin rural and urban areas. H owever , the\nnature of unemployment differs in rural\nand urban areas. In case of rural areas,\nthere is seasonal and disguised\nunemployment . Urban areas have mostly\neducated unemployment.\nSeasonal unemployment happens\nwhen people are not able to find jobs\nduring some months of the year . People\ndependant upon agriculture usually face\nsuch kind of problem. There are certain\nbusy seasons when sowing, harvesting,\nweeding and threshing is done. Certain\nmonths do not provide much work to the\npeople dependant on agriculture.\nIn case of disguised unemployment\npeople appear to be employed. They have\nagricultural plot where they find work.\nThis usually happens among family\nmembers engaged in agricultural activity.\nThe work requires the service of five\npeople but engages eight people. Three\npeople are extra. These three people also\nwork in the same plot as the others. The\ncontribution made by the three extra\npeople does not add to the contribution\nmade by the five people. If three people\nare removed the productivity of the field\nwill not decline. The field requires the\nservice of five people and the three extra\npeople are disguised unemployed.\nIn case of urban areas educated\nunemployment has become a commonphenomenon. Many youth with\nmatriculation, graduation and post\ngraduation degrees are not able to find\njob. A study showed that unemployment\nof graduate and post-graduate has\nincreased faster than among\nmatriculates. A paradoxical manpower\nsituation is witnessed as surplus of\nmanpower in certain categories coexist\nwith shortage of manpower in others.\nThere is unemployment among\ntechnically qualified person on one hand,\nwhile there is a dearth of technical skills\nrequired for economic growth.\nUnemployment leads to wastage of\nmanpower resource. People who are an\nasset for the economy turn into a liability.\nThere is a feeling of hopelessness and\ndespair among the youth. People do not\nhave enough money to support their\nfamily. Inability of educated people who\nare willing to work to find gainful\nemployment implies a great social waste.\nUnemployment tends to increase\neconomic overload. The dependence of the\nunemployed on the working population\nincreases. The quality of life of an\nindividual as well as of society is adversely\naffected. When a family has to live on a\nbare subsistence level there is a general\ndecline in its health status and rising\nwithdrawal from the school system.\nHence, unemployment has detrimental\nimpact on the overall growth of an\neconomy. Increase in unemployment is an\nindicator of a depressed economy. It also\nwastes the resource, which could have\nbeen gainfully employed. If people cannot\nbe used as a resource they naturally\nappear as a liability to the economy.\nIn case of India, statistically, the\nunemployment rate is low. A large\nnumber of people represented with low\nincome and productivity are counted as\nemployed. They appear to work\nthroughout the year but in terms of their\npotential and income, it is not adequate\nfor them. The work that they are pursuing\n2024-25"

Each family\nproduced enough to feed its members.\nEach family met its needs by the\nmembers making their own clothes\nand teaching their own children. One\nof the families decided to send one of\nits sons to an agriculture college. The\nboy got his admission in the nearby\ncollege of agriculture. After some time\nhe became qualified in agro-\nengineering and came back to the\nvillage. He proved to be so creative\nthat he could design an improved\ntype of plough, which increased the\nyield of wheat. Thus a new job of agro-\nengineer was created and filled in the\nvillage. The family in the village sold\nthe surplus in a nearby neighbouring\nvillage. They earned good profit,\nwhich they shared among\nthemselves. Inspired by this success\nall the families after some time held\na meeting in the village. They all\nwanted to have a better future for\ntheir children too. They requested the\npanchayat to open a school in the\nvillage. They assured the panchayat\nthat they would all send their\nchildren to school. The panchayat,\nwith the help of government, opened\na school. A teacher was recruited\nfrom a nearby town. All the children\nof this village started going to school.\nAfter sometime one of the families\ngave training to his daughter inMoreover , the employment structure\nis characterised by self-employment in the\nprimary sector . The whole family\ncontributes in the field even though not\neverybody is really needed. So there is\ndisguised unemployment in the\nagriculture sector . But the entire family\nshares what has been produced. This\nconcept of sharing of work in the field and\nthe produce raised reduces the hardship\nof unemployment in the rural sector . But\nthis does not reduce the poverty of the\nfamily, gradually surplus labour from\nevery household tends to migrate from the\nvillage in search of jobs.\nLet us discuss about the employment\nscenario in the three sectors mentioned\nearlier . Agriculture, is the most labour\nabsorbing sector of the economy. In recent\nyears, there has been a decline in the\ndependence of population on agriculture\npartly because of disguised unemployment\ndiscussed earlier .

They show that\npoverty means hunger and lack of shelter .\nIt also is a situation in which parents are\nnot able to send their children to school\nor a situation where sick people cannot\nafford treatment. Poverty also means lack\nof clean water and sanitation facilities. It\nalso means lack of a regular job at a\nminimum decent level. Above all it means\nliving with a sense of helplessness. Poor\npeople are in a situation in which they\nare ill-treated at almost every place, in\nfarms, factories, govern ment offices,\nhospitals, railway stations etc. Obviously,\nnobody would like to live in poverty.\nOne of the biggest challenges of\nindependent India has been to bring\nmillions of its people out of abject poverty.\nMahatama Gandhi always insisted that\nIndia would be truly independent only\nwhen the poorest of its people become free\nof human suffering.\nPoverty as seen by social scientists\nSince poverty has many facets, social\nscientists look at it through a variety of\nindicators. Usually the indicators used\nrelate to the levels of income and\nconsumption. But now poverty is looked\nthrough other social indicators like\nilliteracy level, lack of general resistance\ndue to malnutrition, lack of access to\nhealthcare, lack of job opportunities, lack\nof access to safe drinking water ,\nsanitation etc. Analysis of poverty based\non social exclusion and vulnerability is\nnow becoming very common (see box).both a cause as well as a\nconsequence of poverty in the usual\nsense. Broadly, it is a process through\nwhich individuals or groups are\nexcluded from facilities, benefits and\nopportunities that others (their\n“betters”) enjoy. A typical example is\nthe working of the caste system in\nIndia in which people belonging to\ncertain castes are excluded from\nequal opportunities. Social exclusion\nthus may lead to, but can cause more\ndamage than, having a very low\nincome.\nVulnerability\nVulnerability  to poverty is a measure,\nwhich describes the greater\nprobability of certain communities\n(say, members of a backward caste)\nor individuals (such as a widow or a\nphysically handicapped person) of\nbecoming, or remaining, poor in the\ncoming years. V ulnerability is\ndetermined by the options available\nto different communities for finding\nan alternative living in terms of\nassets, education, health and job\nopportunities. F urther , it is analysed\non the basis of the greater risks these\ngroups face at the time of natural\ndisasters (earthquakes, tsunami),\nterrorism etc. Additional analysis is\nmade of their social and economic\nability to handle these risks. In fact,\nvulnerability describes the greater\nprobability of being more adversely\naffected than other people when bad\ntime comes for everybody, whether a\nflood or an earthquake or simply a\nfall in the availability of jobs!Social exclusion\nAccording to this concept, poverty\nmust be seen in terms of the poor\nhaving to live only in a poor\nsurrounding with other poor people,\nexcluded from enjoying social equality\nof better -off people in better\nsurroundings.

A person is\nconsidered poor if his or her income or\nconsumption level falls below a given\n“minimum level” necessary to fulfill the\nbasic needs. What is necessary to satisfy\nthe basic needs is different at different\ntimes and in different countries.\nTherefore, poverty line may vary with time\nand place. Each country uses an\nimaginary line that is considered\nappropriate for its existing level of\ndevelopment and its accepted minimum\nsocial norms. For example, a person not\nhaving a car in the United States may be\nconsidered po or. In India, owning of a car\nis still considered a luxury.\nWhile determining the poverty line in\nIndia, a minimum level of food requirement,\nclothing, fo otwear , fuel and light,\neducational and medical requirement, etc.,\nare determ ined for subsistence. These\nphysical quantities are multiplied by their\nprices in rupees. The present formula for\nfood requirement while estimating the\npoverty line is based on the desired\ncalorie requirement.

The calorie needs vary depending\non age, sex and the type of work that a\nperson does. The accepted average calorie\nrequirement in India is 2400 calories per\nperson per day in rural areas and 2100\ncalories per person per day in urban\nareas. Since people living in rural areas\nengage themselves in more physical work,\ncalorie requirements in rural areas are\nconsidered to be higher than in urban\nareas. The monetary expenditure per\ncapita needed for buying these calorie\nrequirements in terms of food grains, etc.,\nis revised periodically taking into\nconsideration the rise in prices.\nOn the basis of these calculations, for\nthe year 2011–12, the poverty line for a\nperson was fixed at Rs 816 per month for\nrural areas and Rs 1000 for urban areas.\nDespite less calorie requirement,thehigher amo unt for urban areas has been\nfixed because of high prices of many\nessential products in urban centres. In\nthis way in the year 2011-12, a family of\nfive members living in rural areas and\nearning less than about Rs 4,080 per\nmonth will be below the poverty line. A\nsimilar family in the urban areas would\nneed a minimum of Rs 5,000 per month\nto meet their basic requirements. The\npoverty line is estimated periodically\n(normally every five years) by conducting\nsample surveys. These surveys are\ncarried out by the National Sample Survey\nOrganisation (N SSO). H owever , for\nmaking comparisons between developing\ncountries, many international\norganisations like the W orld Bank use a\nuniform standard for the poverty line:\nminimum availability of the equivalent of\n$1.90 per person per day (2011, ppp).\n  Let’s Discuss\nDiscuss the following:\n•Why do different countries use different\npoverty lines?\n•What do you think would be the\n“minimum necessary level” in your\nlocality ?\nPoverty Estimates\nIt is clear from Table 3.1 that there is a\nsubstantial decline in poverty ratios in\nIndia from about 45 per cent in 1993-94\nto 37.2 per cent in 2004–05. The\nproportion of people below poverty line\nfurther came down to about 22 per cent\nin 2011–12. If the trend continues, people\nbelow poverty line may come down to less\nthan 20 per cent in the next few years.\nAlthough the percentage of people living\nunder poverty declined in the earlier two\ndecades (1973–1993), the number of poor\ndeclined from 407 million in 2004–05 to\n270 million in 2011–12 with an average\nannual decline of 2.2 percentage points\nduring 2004–05 to 2011–12.\n2024-25"

                "text": "38  \n  Economics\nCauses of Poverty\nThere were a number of causes for the\nwidespread poverty in India. One\nhistorical reason is the low level of\neconomic development under the British\ncolonial administration. The policies of\nthe colonial government ruined traditional\nhandicrafts and discouraged development\nof industries like textiles. The low rate of\ngrowth persisted until the nineteen-\neighties. This resulted in less job\nopportunities and low growth rate of\nincomes. This was accompanied by a high\ngrowth rate of population. The two\ncombined to make the growth rate of per\ncapita income very low. The failure at both\nthe fronts: promotion of economic growth\nand population control perpetuated the\ncycle of poverty.\nWith the spread of irrigation and the\nGreen revolution, many job opportunities\nwere created in the agriculture sector . But\nthe effects were limited to some parts of\nIndia. The industries, both in the public\nand the private sector , did provide some\njobs. But these were not enough to absorb\nall the job seekers. Unable to find proper\njobs in cities, many people started working\nas rickshaw pullers, vendors,\nconstruction workers, domestic servants\netc. With irregular small incomes, these\npeople could not afford expensive housing.\nThey started living in slums on the\noutskirts of the cities and the problems\nof poverty, largely a rural phenomenon\nalso became the feature of the urban\nsector .\nAnother feature of high poverty rates\nhas been the huge income inequalities.\nOne of the major reasons for this is the\nunequal distribution of land and other\nresources. Despite many policies, we have\nnot been able to tackle the issue in a\nmeaningful manner . Major policy\ninitiatives like land reforms which aimed\nat redistribution of assets in rural areas\nhave not been implemented properly andeffectively by most of the state\ngovernments. Since lack of land resources\nhas been one of the major causes of\npoverty in India, proper implementation\nof policy could have improved the life of\nmillions of rural po or.\n Many other socio-cultural and\neconomic factors also are responsible for\npoverty. In order to fulfil social obligations\nand observe religious ceremonies, people\nin India, including the very po or, spend a\nlot of money. Small farmers need money\nto buy agricultural inputs like seeds,\nfertilizer , pesticides etc. Since po or people\nhardly have any savings, they borrow.\nUnable to repay because of poverty, they\nbecome victims of indebtedness. So the\nhigh level of indebtedness is both the\ncause and effect of poverty.\nAnti-Poverty Measures\nRemoval of poverty has been one of the\nmajor objectives of Indian developmental\nstrategy. The current anti-poverty\nstrategy of the government is based\nbroadly on two planks (1) promotion of\neconomic growth (2) targeted anti-poverty\nprogrammes.\nOver a period of thirty years lasting\nup to the early eighties, there were little\nper capita income growth and not much\nreduction in poverty. Official poverty\nestimates which were about 45 per cent\nin the early 1950s remained the same even\nin the early eighties. Since the eighties,\nIndia’s economic growth has been one of\nthe fastest in the world. The growth rate\njumped from the average of about 3.5 per\ncent a year in the 1970s to about 6 per\ncent during the 1980s and 1990s. The\nhigher growth rates have helped\nsignificantly in the reduction of poverty.\nTherefore, it is becoming clear that there\nis a strong link between economic growth\nand poverty reduction. Economic growth\nwidens opportunities and provides the\nresources needed to invest in human\ndevelopment. This also encourages people\n2024-25"

H owever , the po or may not\nbe able to take direct advantage from the\nopportunities created by economic\ngrowth. M oreover , growth in the\nagriculture sector is much below\nexpectations. This has a direct bearing\non poverty as a large number of poor\npeople live in villages and are dependent\non agriculture.\nIn these circumstances, there is a\nclear need for targeted anti-poverty\nprogrammes. A lthough there are so many\nschemes which are formulated to af fect\npoverty directly or indirectly , some of\nthem are worth mentioning. Mahatma\nGandhi National Rural Employment\nGuarantee  Act, 2005 aims to provide 100\ndays of wage employment to every\nhousehold to ensure livelihood security\nin rural areas. I t also aimed at sustainable\ndevelopment to address the cause of\ndraught, deforestration and soil erosion.\nOne-third of the proposed jobs have been\nreserved for women. The scheme provided\nemployment to 220 crores person days of\nemployment to 4.78 crore households.\nThe share of SC , ST, Women person days\nin the scheme are 23 per cent, 17 per\ncent and 53 per cent respectively . The\naverage wage has increased from 65 in\n2006–07 to 132 in 2013–14. Recently , in\nMarch 2018, the wage rate for unskilled\nmanual workers has been revised, state\nwise, the range of wage rate for dif ferent\nstates and union territories lies in\nbetween ` 281 per day (for the workers in\nHaryana) to ` 168 per day  (for the workers\nof Bihar and J harkhan d).\nPrime Minister Rozgar Yozana (PMRY)\nis another scheme which was started in\n1993. The aim of the programme is to\ncreate self-employment opportunitiesfor educated unemployed youth in rural\nareas and small towns. They are helped in\nsetting up small business  and industries.\nRural Employment Generation Programme\n(REG P) was launched in 1995. The aim of\nthe programme is to create self-\nemployment opportunities in rural areas\nand small towns. A target for creating 25\nlakh new jobs has been set for the\nprogramme under the T enth F ive Y ear\nplan. Swarnajayanti Gram Swarozgar\nYojana (SG SY) was launched in 1999. The\nprogramme aims at bringing the assisted\npoor families above the poverty line by\norganising them into self help groups\nthrough a mix of bank credit and\ngovernment subsidy . Under the Pradhan\nMantri Gramodaya Yozana  (PM GY)\nlaunched in 2000 , additional central\nassistance is given to states for basic\nservices such as primary health, primary\neducation, rural shelter , rural drinking\nwater and rural electrification.  Another\nimportant scheme is Antyodaya Anna\nYozana (AAY) about which you will be\nreading more in the next chapter .\nThe results of these programmes have\nbeen mixed. One of the major reasons\nfor less ef fectiveness is the lack of proper\nimplementation and right targeting.\nMoreover , there has be en a lot of\noverlapping of schemes. Despite good\nintentions, the benefits of these schemes\nare not fully reached to the deserving\npoor. Therefore, the major emphasis in\nrecent years is on proper monitoring of\nall the poverty alleviation programmes.\nThe Challenges Ahead\nPoverty has certainly declined in India.\nBut despite the progress, poverty\nreduction remains I ndia’ s most\ncompelling challenge.

The poor\nhouseholds are more vulnerable to food\ninsecurity whenever there is a problem\nof production or distribution of food\ncrops. Food security depends on the\nPublic Distribution System (PDS) and\ngovernment vigilance and action at\ntimes, when this security is threatened.\nWhat is food security?\nFood is as essential for living as air is for\nbreathing. But food security means\nsomething more than getting two square\nmeals. Food security has following\ndimensions\n(a)availability of food  means food\nproduction within the country, food\nimports and the previous years stock\nstored in government granaries.\n(b)accessibility  means food is within reach\nof every person.\n(c)affordability implies that an individual\nhas enough money to buy sufficient,\nsafe and nutritious food to meet one's\ndietary needs.\nThus, food security is ensured in a\ncountry only if (1) enough food is available\nfor all the persons (2) all persons have\nthe capacity to buy food of acceptable\nquality and (3) there is no barrier on\naccess to food.\nWhy food security?\nThe poorest section of the society might\nbe food insecure most of the times while\npersons above the poverty line might also\nbe food insecure when the country facesFood Security in India Chapter4\nFood Security in India\na national disaster/calamity like\nearthquake, drought, flood, tsunami,\nwidespread failure of crops causing\nfamine, etc. How is food security\naffected during a  calamity?  Due to a\nnatural calamity, say drought, total\nproduction of foodgrains decreases. It\ncreates a shortage of food in the affected\nareas. Due to shortage of food, the prices\ngoes up. At the high prices, some people\ncannot afford to buy food. If such calamity\nhappens in a very wide spread area or is\nstretched over a longer time period, it\nmay cause a situation of starvation.\nA massive starvation might take a turn\nof famine.\nA Famine is characterised by wide\nspread deaths due to starvation an dIn the 1970s, food security was\nunderstood as the “availability at all times\nof adequate supply of basic foodstuffs”\n(UN, 1975). Amartya Sen added a new\ndimension to food security and\nemphasised the “access” to food through\nwhat he called ‘entitlements’ — a\ncombination of what one can produce,\nexchange in the market alongwith state\nor other socially provided supplies.\nAccordingly, there has been a substantial\nshift in the understanding of food security.\nThe 1995 W orld F ood Summit declared,\n“Food security at the individual,\nhousehold, regional, national and global\nlevels exists when all people, at all times,\nhave physical and economic access to\nsufficient, safe and nutritious food to meet\ntheir dietary needs and food preferences\nfor an active and healthy life” (FAO, 1996,\np.3).

However , these\nremained consistently higher than the\nbuffer norms. The situation improved\nwith the distribution of foodgrains under\ndifferent schemes launched by the\ngovernment. There is a general\nconsensus that high level of buffer\nstocks of foodgrains is very undesirable\nand can be wasteful. The storage of\nmassive food stocks has been\nresponsible for high carrying costs, in\naddition to wastage and deterioration in\ngrain quality. Freezing of MSP for a few\nyears should be considered seriously.\nThe increased food grains\nprocurement at enhanced MSP# is the\nresult of the pressure exerted by\nleading foodgrain producing states, such\nas Punjab, Haryana an d Andhra\nPradesh. Mor eover , as the pr ocurementis concentrated in a few prosperous\nregions (Punjab, Haryana, W ester n\nUttar Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh and to\na lesser extent in W est Bengal) and\nmainly of two crops— wheat and rice—\nincrease in MSP has induced farmers,\nparticularly in surplus states, to divert\nland from production of coarse grains,\nwhich is the staple food of the poor , to\nthe production of rice and wheat.

In\nurban India, the per person per month\nconsumption of rice, too has declined from\n4.71 Kg in 2004-05 to 4.49 Kg in 2011-12.\nPer Capita consumption of PDS rice has\ndoubled in rural India and increased by\n66% in urban India since 2004-05. The per\nCapita consumption of PDS wheat has\ndoubled since 2004-05 in both rural and\nurban India.\nPDS dealers are sometimes found\nresorting to malpractices like diverting\nthe grains to open market to get better\nmargin, selling poor quality grains at\nration shops, irregular opening of the\nshops, etc. It is common to find that ration\nshops regularly have unsold stocks of poor\nquality grains left. This has proved to be\na big problem. When ration shops are\nunable to sell, a massive stock of\nfoodgrains piles up with the FCI. In recent\nyears, there is another factor that has\nled to the decline of the PDS. Earlier every\nfamily, poor and non-poor had a ration\ncard with a fixed quota of items such as\nrice, wheat, sugar etc. These were sold\nat the same low price to every family. The\nthree types of cards and the range of\nprices that you see today did not exist. A\nlarge number of families could buy\nfoodgrains from the ration shops subject\nto a fixed quota. These included low\nincome families whose incomes were\nmarginally higher than the below poverty\nline families. Now, with TPDS of three\ndifferent prices, any family above the\npoverty line gets very little discount at\nthe ration shop. The price for APL familyis almost as high as open market price,\nso there is little incentive for them to buy\nthese items from the ration shop.\nRole of cooperatives in food security\nThe cooperatives are also playing an\nimportant role in food security in India\nespecially in the southern and western\nparts of the country. The cooperative\nsocieties set  up shops to sell low priced\ngoods to poor people . For example, out\nof all fair price shops running in Tamil\nNadu, around 94 per cent are being run\nby the cooperatives. In Delhi, Mother\nDairy is making strides in provision of\nmilk and vegetables to the consumers\nat controlled rate decided by\nGovernment of Delhi. Amul is another\nsuccess story of cooperatives in milk\nand milk products from Gujarat. It has\nbrought about the White Revolution in\nthe country. These are a few examples\nof many more cooperatives running in\ndifferent parts of the country ensuring\nfood security of different sections\nof society.\nSimilarly, in Maharashtra, Academy of\nDevelopment Science (ADS) has\nfacilitated a network of NGOs for setting\nup grain banks in different regions. ADS\norganises training and capacity building\nprogrammes on food security for NGOs.\nGrain Banks are now slowly taking shape\nin different parts of Maharashtra. ADS\nefforts to set up Grain Banks, to facilitate\nreplication through other NGOs and to\ninfluence the Government’s policy on food\nsecurity are thus paying rich dividends.\nThe ADS Grain Bank programme is\nacknowledged as a succ essful and\ninnovative food security intervention .\n2024-25"

Summary\nFood security of a nation is ensured if all of its citizens have enough nutritious food\navailable, all persons have the capacity to buy food of acceptable quality and there\nis no barrier on access to food. The people living below the poverty line might be food\ninsecure all the time while better off people might also turn food insecure due to\ncalamity or disaster . Although a large section of people suf fer from fo od and nutrition\ninsecurity in India, the worst affected groups are landless or land poor households\nin rural areas and people employed in ill paid occupations and casual labourers\nengaged in seasonal activities in the urban areas. The food insecure people are\ndisproportionately large in some regions of the country, such as economically\nbackward states with high incidence of poverty, tribal and remote areas, regions\nmore prone to natural disasters etc. To ensure availability of food to all sections of\nthe society the Indian government carefully designed food security system, which is\ncomposed of two components: (a) buffer stock and (b) public distribution system. In\naddition to PDS, various poverty alleviation programmes were also started which\ncomprised a component of food security. Some of these programmes are: Integrated\nChild Development Services (I CDS); F ood-for -Work (FF W); M id-Day M eals; A ntyodaya\nAnna Y ojana (A AY) etc. I n addition to the role of the government in ensuring fo od\nsecurity, there are various cooperatives and NGOs also working intensively towards\nthis direction.\n2024-25"
