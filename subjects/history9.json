In different ways all these events were important in themaking of the modern world.\nChapter I is on the French Revolution. Today we often take the ideas of liberty,\nfreedom and equality for granted. But we need to remind ourselves that these ideasalso have a history. By looking at the French Revolution you will read a small partof that history. The French Revolution led to the end of monarchy in France. Asociety based on privileges gave way to a new system of governance. The Declarationof the Rights of Man during the revolution, announced the coming of a new time.The idea that all individuals had rights and could claim equality became part of anew language of politics. These notions of equality and freedom emerged as the centralideas of a new age; but in different countries they were reinterpreted and rethoughtin many different ways. The anti-colonial movements in India and China, Africa andSouth America, produced ideas that were innovative and original, but they spoke ina language that gained currency only from the late eighteenth century.\nIn Chapter II, you will read about the coming of socialism in Europe, and the dramatic\nevents that forced the ruling monarch, Tsar Nicholas II, to give up power. The RussianRevolution sought to change society in a different way. It raised the question ofeconomic equality and the well-being of workers and peasants. The chapter will tellyou about the changes that were initiated by the new Soviet government, the problemsit faced and the measures it undertook. While Soviet Russia pushed ahead withindustrialisation and mechanisation of agriculture, it denied the rights of citizensthat were essential to the working of a democratic society.

It will discuss the rise of Hitler and the\npolitics of Nazism. You will read about the children and women in Nazi Germany,about schools and concentration camps. You will see how Nazism denied variousminorities a right to live, how it drew upon a long tradition of anti-Jewish feelingsto persecute the Jews, and how it waged a relentless battle against democracy andsocialism. But the story of Nazisms rise is not only about a few specific events,about massacres and killings. It is about the working of an elaborate and frighteningsystem which operated at different levels. Some in India were impressed with theideas of Hitler but most watched the rise of Nazism with horror.\nThe history of the modern world is not simply a story of the unfolding of freedom\nand democracy. It has also been a story of violence and tyranny, death and destruction."

He was 20 years old and married to the Austrianprincess Marie Antoinette. Upon his accession the new king foundan empty treasury. Long years of war had drained the financial\nresources of France. Added to this was the cost of maintaining an\nextravagant court at the immense palace of Versailles. Under LouisXVI, France helped the thirteen American colonies to gain theirindependence from the common enemy, Britain. The war added morethan a billion livres  to a debt that had already risen to more than 2\nbillion livres. Lenders who gave the state credit, now began to charge\n10 per cent interest on loans. So the French government was obligedto spend an increasing percentage of its budget on interest paymentsalone. To meet its regular expenses, such as the cost of maintainingan army, the court, running government offices or universities, the\nstate was forced to increase taxes. Yet even this measure would not\nhave sufficed. French society in the eighteenth century was dividedinto three estates, and only members of the third estate paid taxes.\nThe society of estates was part of the feudal system that dated back to\nthe middle ages. The term Old Regime is usually used to describe the\nsociety and institutions of France before 1789.\nFig. 2 shows how the system of  estates in French society was organised.\nPeasants made up about 90 per cent of the population. However,\nonly a small number of them owned the land they cultivated. About\n60 per cent of the land was owned by nobles, the Church and otherricher members of the third estate. The members of the first twoestates, that is, the clergy  and the nobility, enjoyed certain pri vileges by\nbirth. The most important of these was exemption from paying taxes to\nthe state. The nobles fur ther enjoyed feudal pri vileges. T hese inc luded\nfeudal dues, which they extracted from the peasants. Peasants were obliged\nto render services to the lord  to work in his house and fields  to servein the army or to participate in building r oads.\nThe Church too extracted its share of taxes called tithes  from the peasants,\nand finally, all members of  the third estate had to pay taxes to the state.\nThese included a direct tax, called taille , and a number of indirect taxes\nwhich were levied on articles of everyday consumption like salt or tobacco.The burden of financing activities of the state through taxes was borne\nby the third estate alone.\nNew words\nLivre  Unit of currency in France,\ndiscontinued in 1794Clergy  Gr oup of  persons invested with\nspecial functions in the churchTithe  A tax levied by the church, comprisingone-tenth of the agricultural produceTaille  Tax to be paid directly to the state1  French Society During the Late Eighteenth Century\nClergy\nNobility\nPeasants and\nartisans\nSmall peasants,\nlandless labour,servantsBig businessmen,\nmerchants, courtofficials, lawyers etc.\nFig.2  A Society of Estates.\nNote that within the Third Estate some wererich and others poor.1st estate\n3rd estate2nd estate"

This was left to thosegroups within the third estate who had become prosperous and hadaccess to education and new ideas.\nThe eighteenth century witnessed the emergence of social groups,\ntermed the middle class, who earned their wealth through anexpanding overseas trade and from the manufacture of goods such aswoollen and silk textiles that were either exported or bought by thericher members of society. In addition to merchants andmanufacturers, the third estate included professions such as lawyersor administrative officials. All of these were educated and believedthat no group in society should be privileged by birth. Rather, apersons social position must depend on his merit.

Georges Danton , who later became active in revolutionary politics, wrote to a friend in\n1793, looking back upon the time when he had just completed his studies:\nI was educated in the residential college of Plessis. There I was in the company of\nimportant men  Once my studies ended, I was left with nothing. I started looking for apost. It was impossible to find one at the law courts in Paris. The choice of a career in thearmy was not open to me as I was not a noble by birth, nor did I have a patron. Thechurch too could not offer me a refuge. I could not buy an office as I did not possess asou. My old friends turned their backs to me  the system had provided us with aneducation wi thout however offering a field wher e our talents could be utilised.\n2. An Englishman, Arthur Young, trav elled through France during the y ears from 1787 to\n1789 and wrote detailed descriptions of his journeys. He often commented on what hesaw.\nHe who decides to be served and waited upon by slaves, ill-treated slaves at that, must\nbe fully aware that by doing so he is placing his property and his life in a situation which isvery different from that he would be in, had he chosen the services of free and well-treated men.

Rousseau carried the idea forward, proposing a\nform of government based on a social contract between peopleand their representatives. In The Spirit of the Laws,  Montesquieu\nproposed a division of power within the government betweenthe legislative, the executive and the judiciary. This model ofgovernment was put into force in the USA, after the thirteencolonies declared their independence from Britain. The Americanconstitution and its guarantee of individual rights was an importantexample for political thinkers in France.\nThe ideas of these philosophers were discussed intensively in salons\nand coffee-houses and spread among people through books andnewspapers. These were frequently read aloud in groups for thebenefit of those who could not read and write. The news thatLouis XVI planned to impose further taxes to be able to meet theexpenses of the state generated anger and protest against the systemof privileges.\nSource"

In France of the Old Regime the monarch did not have thepower to impose taxes according to his will alone. Rather he had tocall a meeting of the Estates General which would then pass hisproposals for new taxes. The Estates General was a political body towhich the three estates sent their representatives. However, themonarch alone could decide when to call a meeting of this body. The\nlast time it was done was in 1614.\nOn 5 May 1789, Louis XVI called together an assembly of the Estates\nGeneral to pass proposals for new taxes. A resplendent hall inVersailles was prepared to host the delegates. The first and secondestates sent 300 representatives each, who were seated in rows facingeach other on two sides, while the 600 members of the third estatehad to stand at the back. The third estate was represented by its moreprosperous and educated members. Peasants, artisans and women\nwere denied entry to the assembly. However, their grievances and\ndemands were listed in some 40,000 letters which the representativeshad brought with them.\nVoting in the Estates General in the past had been conducted according\nto the principle that each estate had one vote. This time too LouisXVI was determined to continue the same practice. But members ofthe third estate demanded that voting now be conducted by theassembly as a  whole, where each member would have one vote. This\nwas one of the democratic principles put forward by philosophers\nlike Rousseau in his book The Social Contract . When the king rejected\nthis proposal, members of the third estate walked out of the assemblyin protest.\nThe representatives of the third estate viewed themselves as spokesmen\nfor the whole French nation. On 20 June they assembled in the hallof an indoor tennis court in the grounds of Versailles. They declaredthemselves a National Assembly and swore not to disperse till they\nhad drafted a constitution for France that would limit the powers of\nthe monarch. They were led by Mirabeau and Abbé Sieyès. Mirabeauwas born in a noble family but was convinced of the need to do awaywith a society of feudal privilege. He brought out a journal anddelivered powerful speeches to the crowds assembled at Versailles.2  The Outbreak of the Revolution\nActivity\nRepresentatives of the Third Estate take the\noath raising their arms in the direction ofBailly, the President of the Assembly,\nstanding on a table in the centre.

A large number of nobles fled from theirhomes, many of them migrating to neighbouring countries.\nFaced with the power of his revolting subjects, Louis XVI finally\naccorded recognition to the National Assembly and accepted theprinciple that his powers would from now on be checked by aconstitution. On the night of 4 August 1789, the Assembly passed adecree abolishing the feudal system of obligations and taxes. Membersof the clergy too were forced to give up their privileges.

Only men above 25 yearsof age who paid taxes equal to at least 3 days of a labourers wagewere given the status of active citizens, that is, they were entitled tovote.

Rulers of other neighbouringcountries too were worried by the developments in France and madeplans to send troops to put down the events that had been taking placethere since the summer of 1789. Before this could happen, the National\nAssembly voted in April 1792 to declare war against Prussia and Austria.\nThousands of volunteers thronged from the provinces to join the army .They saw this as a war of the people against kings and aristocracies allover Europe. Among the patriotic songs they sang was the Marseillaise ,\ncomposed by the poet Roget de LIsle. It was sung for the first time by\nvolunteers from Marseilles as they marched into Paris and so got its\nname. The Marseillaise is now the national anthem of France.\nThe revolutionary wars brought losses and economic difficulties\nto the people. While the men were away fighting at the front,women were left to cope with the tasks of earning a living andlooking after their families. Large sections of the population were\nconvinced that the revolution had to be carried further, as the\nConstitution of 1791 gave political rights only to the richer sectionsof society. Political clubs became an important rallying point forpeople who wished to discuss government policies and plan theirown forms of action. The most successful of these clubs was that of\nthe Jacobins, which got its name from the former convent  of St\nJacob in Paris. Women too, who had been active throughout thisperiod, formed their own clubs.

The colonies inthe Caribbean  Martinique, Guadeloupe and San Domingo  wereimportant suppliers of commodities such as tobacco, indigo, sugarand coffee. But the reluctance of Europeans to go and work in distantand unfamiliar lands meant a shortage of labour on the plantations.So this was met by a triangular slave trade between Europe, Africaand the Americas. The slave trade began in the seventeenth century.French merchants sailed from the ports of Bordeaux or Nantes tothe African coast, where they bought slaves from local chieftains.Branded and shackled, the slaves were packed tightly into ships forthe three-month long voyage across the Atlantic to the Caribbean.There they were sold to plantation owners. The exploitation of slavelabour made it possible to meet the growing demand in Europeanmarkets for sugar, coffee, and indigo. Port cities like Bordeaux andNantes owed their economic prosperity to the flourishing slave trade.\nThroughout the eighteenth century there was little criticism of slavery\nin France. The National Assembly held long debates about whetherthe rights of man should be extended to all French subjects includingthose in the colonies. But it did not pass any laws, fearing oppositionfrom businessmen whose incomes depended on the slave trade. Itwas finally the Convention which in 1794 legislated to free all slavesin the French overseas possessions. This, however, turned out to bea short-term measure: ten years later, Napoleon reintroduced slavery.Plantation owners understood their freedom as including the rightto enslave African Negroes  in pursuit of their economic interests.\nSlavery was finally abolished in French colonies in 1848.\nFig.14  The emancipation of slaves.\nThis print of 1794 describes the emancipation\nof slaves.

As youhave read, before the eighteenth century society was broadly dividedinto estates and orders and it was the aristocracy and church whichcontrolled economic and social power. Suddenly, after the revolution,it seemed possible to change this. In many parts of the world includingEurope and Asia, new ideas about individual rights and whocontrolled social power began to be discussed. In India, RajaRammohan Roy and Derozio talked of the significance of the FrenchRevolution, and many others debated the ideas of post-revolutionaryEurope. The developments in the colonies, in turn, reshaped theseideas of societal change.\nNot everyone in Europe, however, wanted a complete transformation\nof society. Responses varied from those who accepted that somechange was necessary but wished for a gradual shift, to those whowanted to restructure society radically. Some were conservatives,others were liberals or radicals. What did these terms really meanin the context of the time? What separated these strands of politicsand what linked them together? We must remember that these termsdo not mean the same thing in all contexts or at all times.\nWe will look briefly at some of the important political traditions of\nthe nineteenth century, and see how they influenced change. Thenwe will focus on one historical event in which there was an attemptat a radical transformation of society. Through the revolution inRussia, socialism became one of the most significant and powerfulideas to shape society in the twentieth century.\n1.1 Liberals, Radicals and Conservatives\nOne of the groups which looked to change society were the liberals.Liberals wanted a nation which tolerated all religions.

Liberals\nalso opposed the uncontrolled power of dynastic rulers. They wantedto safeguard the rights of individuals against governments. Theyargued for a representative, elected parliamentary government, subjectto laws interpreted by a well-trained judiciary that was independent\nof rulers and officials. However, they were not democrats. They\ndid not believe in universal adult franchise, that is, the right of everycitizen to vote. They felt men of property mainly should have thevote. They also did not want the vote for women.\nIn contrast, radicals wanted a nation in which government was based\non the majority of a countrys population. Many supported womenssuffragette  movements. Unlike liberals, they opposed the privileges\nof great landowners and wealthy factory owners. They were notagainst the existence of private property but disliked concentration\nof property in the hands of a few.\nConservatives were opposed to radicals and liberals. After the French\nRevolution, however, even conservatives had opened their minds tothe need for change. Earlier, in the eighteenth century, conservatives\nhad been generally opposed to the idea of change. By the nineteenth\ncentury, they accepted that some change was inevitable but believedthat the past had to be respected and change had to be brought aboutthrough a slow process.\nSuch differing ideas about societal change clashed during the social\nand political turmoil that followed the French Revolution. Thevarious attempts at revolution and national transformation in thenineteenth century helped define both the limits and potential ofthese political tendencies.\n1.2 Industrial Society and Social Change\nThese political trends were signs of a new time. It was a time of\nprofound social and economic changes. It was a time when new cities\ncame up and new industrialised regions developed,  railways expandedand the Industrial Revolution occurred.\nIndustrialisation brought men, women and children to factories.  Work\nhours were often long and wages were poor. Unemployment was\ncommon, particularly during times of low demand for industrial goods.Housing and sanitation were problems since towns were growingrapidly.

By the mid - nineteenth century in Europe, socialism\nwas a well-known body of ideas that attracted widespread attention.\nSocialists were against private property, and saw it as the root of all social ills\nof the time. Why? Individuals owned the property that gave employment\nbut the propertied were concerned only with  personal gain and not with\nthe welfare of those who made the property productive. So if society as awhole rather than single individuals controlled property, more attention\nwould be paid to collective social interests. Socialists wanted this change and\ncampaigned for it.\nHow could a society without property operate? What would be the basis of\nsocialist society?\nSocialists had different visions of the future. Some believed in the idea of\ncooperatives. Robert Owen (1771-1858), a leading English manufacturer,\nsought to build a cooperative community called New Harmony in Indiana(USA). Other socialists felt that cooperatives could not be built on a wide\nscale only through individual initiative: they demanded that governments\nencourage cooperatives. In France, for instance, Louis Blanc (1813-1882)wanted the government to encourage cooperatives and replace capitalistenterprises. These cooperatives were to be associations of people who\nproduced goods together and divided the profits according to the work\ndone by members.\nKarl Marx (1818-1883) and Friedrich Engels (1820-1895) added other ideas\nto this body of arguments. Marx argued that industrial society was capitalist.\nCapitalists owned the capital invested in factories, and the profit of capitalists\nwas produced by workers.  The conditions of workers could not improveas long as this profit was accumulated by private capitalists. Workers had to\noverthrow capitalism and the rule of private property. Marx believed that\nto free themselves from capitalist exploitation, workers had to construct aradically socialist society where all property was socially controlled. This\nwould be a communist society. He was convinced that workers would\ntriumph in their conflict with capitalists. A communist society was the naturalsociety of the future.\nList two differences between the capitalist\nand socialist ideas of private property."

To coordinate\ntheir efforts, socialists formed an international body  namely, theSecond International.\nWorkers in England and Germany began forming associations to\nfight for better living and working conditions. They set up funds tohelp members in times of distress and demanded a reduction of workinghours and the right to vote. In Germany , these associations worked closely\nwith the Social Democratic Party (SPD) and helped it win parliamentaryseats. By 1905, socialists and trade unionists formed a Labour Party inBritain and a Socialist Party in France. However, till 1914, socialists neversucceeded in forming a government in Europe.

The ParisCommune was ultimately crushed by government troops but it was celebrated by Socialists the world over as a prelude to a\nsocialist revolution.The Paris Commune  is also popularly remembered for two important legacies: one, for its association with\nthe workers red flag  that was the flag adopted by the communards ( revolutionaries) in Paris; two, for the Marseillaise,originally written as a war song in 1792, it became a symbol of the Commune and of the struggle for liberty."

The fall of monarchy in February 1917and the events of October are normally called the Russian Revolution.\nHow did this come about? What were the social and political\nconditions in Russia when the revolution occurred? To answer thesequestions, let us look at Russia a few years before the revolution.\n2.1 The Russian Empire in 1914\nIn 1914, Tsar Nicholas II ruled Russia and its empire. Besides theterritory around Moscow, the Russian empire included current-dayFinland, Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia, parts of Poland, Ukraine andBelarus. It stretched to the Pacific and comprised todays CentralAsian states, as well as Georgia, Armenia and Azerbaijan. The majorityreligion was Russian Orthodox Christianity  which had grown outof the Greek Orthodox Church  but the empire also  includedCatholics, Protestants, Muslims and Buddhists.\nFig.3  Tsar Nicholas II in the White\nHall of the Winter Palace,\nSt Petersburg, 1900.Painted by Earnest Lipgart (1847-1932)\nFig.4  Europe in 1914.The map shows the Russian empire and the European countries at war during the FirstWorld War."

                "text": "Socialism in Europe and the Russian Revolution\n312.2 Economy and Society\nAt the beginning of the twentieth century, the vast majority of\nRussias people were agriculturists. About 85 per cent of the Russianempires population earned their living from agriculture. Thisproportion was higher than in most European countries. For instance,in France and Germany the proportion was between 40 per cent and50 per cent. In the empire, cultivators produced for the market aswell as for their own needs and Russia was a major exporter of grain.\nIndustry was found in pockets. Prominent industrial areas were\nSt Petersburg and Moscow. Craftsmen undertook much of theproduction, but large factories existed alongside craft workshops.\nMany factories were set up in the 1890s, when Russias railway\nnetwork was extended, and foreign investment in industry increased.Coal production doubled and iron and steel output quadrupled. Bythe 1900s, in some areas factory workers and craftsmen were almostequal in number.\nMost industry was the private property of industrialists. Government\nsupervised large factories to ensure minimum wages and limited hoursof work. But factory inspectors could not prevent rules being broken.In craft units and small workshops, the working day was sometimes15 hours, compared with 10 or 12 hours in factories. Accommodationvaried from rooms to dormitories.\nWorkers were a divided social group. Some had strong links with\nthe villages from which they came. Others had settled in citiespermanently. Workers were divided by skill. A metalworker of St.Petersburg recalled, Metalworkers considered themselves aristocrats\namong other workers. Their occupations demanded more training\nand skill . . .  Women made up 31 per cent of the factory labourforce by 1914, but they were paid less than men (between half andthree-quarters of a mans wage). Divisions among workers showedthemselves in dress and manners too. Some workers formedassociations to help members in times of unemployment or financialhardship but such associations were few .\nDespite divisions, workers did unite to strike work (stop work) when\nthey disagreed with employers about dismissals or work conditions.These strikes took place  frequently in the textile industry during1896-1897, and in the metal industry during 1902.\nIn the countryside, peasants cultivated most of the land. But the\nnobility, the crown and the Orthodox Church owned largeproperties. Like workers, peasants too were divided. They were also\nFig.5  Unemployed peasants in pre-war\nSt Petersburg.\nMany survived by eating at charitablekitchens and living in poorhouses.\nFig.6  Workers sleeping in bunkers in a\ndormitory in pre-revolutionary Russia.They slept in shifts and could not keep their\nfamilies with them."

Nobles got their power and position through their services\nto the Tsar, not through local popularity. This was unlike France\nwhere, during the French Revolution in Brittany, peasants respected\nnobles and fought for them. In Russia, peasants wanted the land of\nthe nobles to be given to them. Frequently, they refused to pay rent\nand even murdered landlords. In 1902, this occurred on a large scale\nin south Russia. And in 1905,  such incidents took place all\nover Russia.\nRussian peasants were different from other European peasants in\nanother way. They pooled their land together periodically and their\ncommune ( mir) divided it according to the needs of individual families.\n2.3 Socialism in Russia\nAll political parties were illegal in Russia before 1914. The Russian\nSocial Democratic Workers Party was founded in 1898 by socialists\nwho respected Marxs ideas. However, because of government\npolicing, it had to operate as an illegal organisation. It set up a\nnewspaper, mobilised workers and organised strikes.\nSome Russian socialists felt that the Russian peasant custom of dividing\nland periodically made them natural socialists. So peasants, not\nworkers, would be the main force of the revolution, and Russia could\nbecome socialist more quickly than other countries. Socialists were\nactive in the countryside through the late nineteenth century.  They\nformed the Socialist Revolutionary Party in 1900. This party struggled\nfor peasants rights and demanded that land belonging to nobles be\ntransferred to peasants. Social Democrats disagreed with Socialist\nRevolutionaries about peasants. Lenin felt that peasants were not\none united group. Some were poor and others rich, some worked as\nlabourers while others were capitalists who employed workers. Given\nthis differentiation within them, they could not all be part of a\nsocialist movement.\nThe party was divided over the strategy of organisation. Vladimir\nLenin (who led the Bolshevik group) thought that in a repressive\nsociety like Tsarist Russia the party should be disciplined and should\ncontrol the number and quality of its members.  Others (Mensheviks)\nthought that the party should be open to all (as in Germany).\n2.4 A Turbulent Time: The 1905 Revolution\nRussia was an autocracy . Unlike other European rulers, even at the\nbeginning of the twentieth century, the Tsar was not subject toAlexander Shly apnikov, a socialist\nworker of the time, gives us a descriptionof how the meetings were organised:\nPropaganda was done in the plants and\nshops on an individual basis.

Illegalmeetings were  arranged on the spurof the moment but in an organised wayduring lunch, in evening break, in frontof the exit, in the yard or, inestablishments with several floors, onthe stairs. The most alert workers wouldform a plug in the doorway, and thewhole mass piled up in the exit. Anagitator would get up right there on thespot.

They were supported in the empireby nationalists (in Poland for instance) and in Muslim-dominatedareas by jadidists  who wanted modernised Islam to lead their societies.\nThe year 1904 was a particularly bad one for Russian workers. Prices\nof essential goods rose so quickly that real wages  declined by 20 per\ncent. The membership of workers associations rose dramatically.When four members of the Assembly of Russian Workers, whichhad been formed in 1904, were dismissed at the Putilov Iron Works,there was a call for industrial action. Over the next few days over110,000 workers in St Petersburg went on strike demanding areduction in the working day to eight hours, an increase in wagesand improvement in working conditions.\nWhen the procession of workers led by Father Gapon reached the\nWinter Palace it was attacked by the police and the Cossacks. Over100 workers were killed and about 300 wounded. The incident,known as Bloody Sunday, started a series of events that became knownas the 1905 Revolution. Strikes took place all over the country anduniversities closed down when student bodies staged walkouts,complaining about the lack of civil liberties. Lawyers, doctors,engineers and other middle-class workers established the Union ofUnions and demanded a constituent assembly.\nDuring the 1905 Revolution, the Tsar allowed the creation of an\nelected consultative Parliament or Duma. For a brief while duringthe revolution, there existed a large number of trade unions andfactory committees made up of factory workers. After 1905, mostcommittees and unions worked unofficially, since they were declaredillegal. Severe restrictions were placed on political activity. The Tsardismissed the first Duma within 75 days and the re-elected secondDuma within three months. He did not want any questioning of hisauthority or any reduction in his power. He changed the votinglaws and packed the third Duma with conservative politicians.

There were over 7 million casualties by 1917.As they retreated, the Russian army destroyedcrops and buildings to prevent the enemy frombeing able to live off the land. The destruction ofcrops and buildings led to over 3 million refugees in Russia. Thesituation discredited the government and the Tsar.  Soldiers did notwish to fight such a war.\nThe war also had a severe impact on industry. Russias own industries\nwere few in number and  the country was cut off from other suppliersof industrial goods by German control of the Baltic Sea. Industrialequipment disintegrated more rapidly in Russia than elsewhere inEurope. By 1916, railway lines began to break down. Able-bodiedmen were called up to the war. As a result, there were labour shortagesand small workshops producing essentials were shut down. Largesupplies of grain were sent to feed the army. For the people in thecities, bread and flour  became scarce. By the winter of 1916, riots atbread shops were common."

They  permitted peasants to cultivate the land that hadbeen socialised. Bolsheviks used confiscated land to demonstrate what\ncollective work could be.\nA process of centralised planning was introduced. Officials assessed\nhow the economy could work and set targets for a five-year period.\nOn this basis they made the Five Year Plans. The government fixedall prices to promote industrial growth during the first two Plans\n(1927-1932 and 1933-1938). Centralised planning led to economic\ngrowth. Industrial production increased (between 1929 and 1933 by100 per cent in the case of oil, coal and steel). New factory cities\ncame into being.\nHowever, rapid construction led to poor working conditions. In\nthe city of Magnitogorsk, the construction of a steel plant was achieved\nin three years. Workers lived hard lives and the result was 550stoppages of work in the first year\n alone. In living quarters, in the\nwintertime, at 40 degrees below, people had to climb down from the\nfourth floor and dash across the street in order to go to the toilet.\nAn extended schooling system developed, and arrangements were\nmade for factory workers and peasants to enter universities. Crèches\nwere established in factories for the children of women workers.Cheap public health care was provided. Model living quarters were\nset up for workers. The effect of all this was uneven, though, since\ngovernment resources were limited."

By 1927-1928, the towns in Soviet Russia were facing an acuteproblem of grain supplies. The government fixed prices\nat which grain must be sold, but the  peasants refused to sell theirgrain to government buyers at these prices.\nStalin, who headed the party after the death of Lenin, introduced\nfirm emergency measures. He believed that rich peasants and tradersin the countryside were holding stocks in the hope of higher prices.Speculation had to be stopped and supplies confiscated.\nIn 1928, Party members toured the grain-producing areas, supervising\nenforced grain collections, and raiding kulaks   the name for well-to-do peasants. As shortages continued, the decision was taken tocollectivise farms. It was argued that grain shortages were partly due\nto the small size of holdings. After 1917, land had been  given over to\npeasants. These small-sized peasant farms could not be modernised.To develop modern farms, and run them along industrial lines withmachinery, it was necessary to eliminate kulaks, take away landfrom peasants, and establish state-controlled large farms.\nWhat followed was Stalins collectivisation programme. From 1929,\nthe Party forced all peasants to cultivate in collective farms ( kolkhoz ).\nThe bulk of land and implements were transferred to the ownershipof collective farms. Peasants worked on the land, and the kolkhoz\nprofit was shared. Enraged peasants resisted the authorities anddestroyed their livestock. Between 1929 and 1931, the number ofcattle fell by one-third. Those who resisted collectivisation wereseverely punished. Many were deported  and exiled . As they resisted\ncollectivisation, peasants argued that they were not rich and they\nwere not against socialism. They merely did not want to work incollective farms for a variety of reasons. Stalins government allowedsome independent cultivation, but treated such cultivatorsunsympathetically.\nIn spite of collectivisation, production did not increase immediately.\nIn fact, the bad harvests of 1930-1933 led to one of most devastatingfamines in Soviet history when over 4 million died.\nFig.18  A poster during collectivisation.

In the world socialist movement too itwas recognised that all was not well in the Soviet Union. A backwardcountry had become a great power. Its industries and agriculturehad developed and the poor were being fed. But it had denied theessential freedoms to its citizens and carried out its developmentalprojects through repressive policies. By the end of the twentiethcentury, the international reputation of the USSR as a socialistcountry had declined though it was recognised that socialist idealsstill enjoyed respect among its people.

Later, Helmuths father shot himself in his office. Helmuth\nremembers that he saw his fa thers bloody unifor m being burnt in the\nfamily fireplace.

Therepublic carried the burden of war guilt and national humiliationand was financially crippled by being forced to pay compensation.Those who suppor ted the W eimar Republic, mainly Socialists , Catholics\nand Democrats, became easy targets of  attack in the conservative\nnationalist circles.

Soldiers came to be placed above civilians. Politicians andpublicists laid great stress on the need for men to be aggressive, strongand masculine. The media glorified trench life. The truth, however,was that soldiers lived miserable lives in these trenches, trapped withrats feeding on corpses. They faced poisonous gas and enemy shelling,and witnessed their ranks reduce rapidly. Aggressive war propagandaand national honour occupied centre stage in the public sphere, whilepopular support grew for conservative dictatorships that had recentlycome into being.

The Nazis could not effectively mobilise popularsupport till the early 1930s. It was during the Great Depression thatNazism became a mass movement. As we have seen, after 1929, bankscollapsed and businesses shut down, workers lost their jobs and themiddle classes were threatened with destitution. In such a situationNazi propaganda  stirred hopes of a better future. In 1928, the Nazi\nParty got no more than 2. 6 per cent votes in the Reichstag  theGerman parliament. By 1932, it had become the largest party with37 per cent votes.2  Hitler’s Rise to Power\nFig.7  Hitler being greeted at the Party Congress in Nuremberg in 1938.New words\nPropaganda  Specific type of message\ndirectly aimed at influencing the opinionof people (through the use of posters, films,speeches, etc.)"

It is\nan image that captured the imagination of a people whose sense of\ndignity and pride had been shattered, and who were living in a time\nof acute economic and political crises.\n2.1 The Destruction of Democracy\nOn 30 January 1933, President Hindenburg offered the\nChancellorship, the highest position in the cabinet of ministers, to\nHitler. By now the Nazis had  managed to rally the conservatives to\ntheir cause. Having acquired power, Hitler set out to dismantle the\nstructures of democratic rule. A mysterious fire that broke out in\nthe German Parliament building in February facilitated his move.\nThe Fire Decree of 28 February 1933 indefinitely suspended civic\nrights like freedom of speech, press and assembly that had been\nguaranteed by the Weimar constitution. Then he turned on his arch-\nenemies, the Communists, most of whom were hurriedly packed off\nto the newly established concentration camps . The repression of\nthe Communists was severe. Out of the surviving 6,808 arrest filesof Duesseldorf, a small city of half a million population, 1,440 were\nthose of Communists alone. They were, however, only one among\nthe 52 types of victims persecuted by the Nazis across the country.\nOn 3 March 1933, the famous Enabling Act was passed. This Act\nestablished dictatorship in Germany. It gave Hitler all powers to\nsideline Parliament and rule by decree. All political parties and trade\nunions were banned except for the Nazi Party and its affiliates. The\nstate established complete control over the economy, media, army\nand judiciary.\nSpecial surveillance and security forces were created to control and\norder society in ways that the Nazis wanted.  Apart from the already\nexisting regular police in green uniform and the SA or the Storm\nTroopers, these included the Gestapo (secret state police), the SS (the\nprotection squads), criminal police and the Security Service (SD). It\nwas the extra-constitutional powers of these newly organised forces\nthat gave the Nazi state its reputation as the most dreaded criminal\nstate. People could now be detained in Gestapo torture chambers,\nrounded up and sent to concentration camps, deported at will or\narrested without any legal procedures. The police forces acquired\npowers to rule with impunity.New words\nConcentration camp  A camp where people\nwere isolated and detained without dueprocess of law. Typically, it was surroundedby electrified barbed wire fences."

According\nto this there was no equality between people, but only a racialhierarchy. In this view blond, blue-eyed, Nordic German Aryanswere at the top, while Jews were located at the lowest rung. Theycame to be regarded as an anti-race, the arch-enemies of the Aryans.All other coloured people were placed in between depending upontheir external features. Hitlers racism borrowed from thinkers likeCharles Darwin and Herbert Spencer. Darwin was a natural scientistwho tried to explain the creation of plants and animals through theconcept of evolution and natural selection. Herbert Spencer lateradded the idea of survival of the fittest. According to this idea, onlythose species survived on earth that could adapt themselves tochanging climatic conditions. We should bear in mind that Darwinnever advocated human intervention in what he thought was a purelynatural process of selection. However, his ideas were used by racistthinkers and politicians to justify imperial rule over conqueredpeoples. The Nazi argument was simple: the strongest race wouldsurvive and the weak ones would perish. The Aryan race was thefinest. It had to retain its purity, become stronger and dominate theworld.\nThe other aspect of Hitlers ideology related to the geopolitical\nconcept of Lebensraum , or living space. He believed that new territories\nhad to be acquired for settlement. This would enhance the area ofthe mother country, while enabling the settlers on new lands to retainan intimate link with the place of their origin. It would also enhancethe material resources and power of the German nation.\nHitler intended to extend German boundaries by moving eastwards,\nto concentrate all Germans geographically in one place. Poland becamethe laboratory for this experimentation.\n3.1 Establishment of the Racial State\nOnce in power, the Nazis quickly began to implement their dreamof creating an exclusive racial community of pure Germans byphysically eliminating all those who were seen as  undesirable in the3  The Nazi Worldview\nSource A\nFor this earth is not allotted to anyone\nnor is it presented to anyone as a gift.

Only theywere seen as worthy of prospering and multiplying against all others\nwho were classed as undesirable. This meant that even those Germans\nwho were seen as impure or abnormal had no right to exist. Under\nthe Euthanasia Programme, Helmuths father along with other Nazi\nofficials had condemned to death many Germans who were consideredmentally or physically unfit.\nJews were not the only community classified as undesirable. There\nwere others. Many Gypsies  and blacks living in Nazi Germany were\nconsidered as racial inferiors who threatened the biological purity\nof the superior Aryan race. They were widely persecuted . Even\nRussians and Poles were considered subhuman, and hence undeserving\nof any humanity. When Germany occupied Poland and parts ofRussia, captured civilians were forced to work as slave labour. Many\nof them died simply through hard work and starvation.\nJews remained the worst sufferers in Nazi Germany. Nazi hatred  of\nJews had a precursor in the traditional Christian hostility towards\nJews. They had been stereotyped as killers of Christ and\nusurers .Until medieval times  Jews were barred from owning land.\nThey survived mainly through trade and moneylending. They livedin separately marked areas called ghettos. They were often persecuted\nthrough periodic organised violence, and expulsion from the land.\nHowever, Hitlers hatred of Jews was based on pseudoscientific\ntheories of race, which held that conversion was no solution to\nthe Jewish problem. It could be solved only through theirtotal elimination.\nFrom 1933 to 1938 the Nazis terrorised, pauperised  and segregated\nthe Jews, compelling them to leave the country. The next phase,\n1939-1945, aimed at concentrating them in certain areas and eventually\nkilling them in gas chambers in Poland.\n3.2 The Racial Utopia\nUnder the shadow of war, the Nazis proceeded  to realise their\nmurderous, racial ideal. Genocide and war became two sides of the\nsame coin. Occupied Poland was divided up. Much of north-western\nPoland was annexed to Germany.

This meant that teachers who were Jews or seen as\npolitically unreliable were dismissed. Children were first segregated:Germans and Jews could not sit together or play together.Subsequently, undesirable children  Jews,  the physically handicapped,Gypsies  were thrown out of schools. And finally in the 1940s, theywere taken to the gas chambers.\nGood German children were subjected to a process of Nazi schooling,\na prolonged period of ideological training. School textbooks wererewritten. Racial science was introduced to justify Nazi ideas of race.Stereotypes about Jews were popularised even through maths classes.Children were taught to be loyal and submissive, hate Jews, and worshipHitler. Even the function of sports was to nurture a spirit of violenceand aggression among children. Hitler believed that boxing could makechildren iron hearted, strong and masculine.\nYouth organisations were made responsible for educating German\nyouth in the the spirit of National Socialism. Ten-year-olds had toenter Jungvolk .

Many organised active resistance\nto Nazism, braving police repression and death. The large majorityof Germans, however, were passive onlookers and apathetic witnesses.They were too scared to act, to differ, to protest. They preferred tolook  away. Pastor Niemoeller, a resistance fighter, observed anabsence of protest, an uncanny silence, amongst ordinary Germansin the face of brutal and organised crimes committed against peoplein the Nazi empire. He wrote movingly about this silence:\n‘First they came for the Communists,\nWell, I was not a Communist \nSo I said nothing.\nThen they came for the Social Democrats,Well, I was not a Social DemocratSo I did nothing,\nThen they came for the trade unionists,\nBut I was not a trade unionist.And then they came for the Jews,But I was not a Jew \n so I did little.\nThen when they came for me,\nThere was no one left who could stand up for me. ’Was the lack of concern for Nazi victims only\nbecause of the Terror? No, says LawrenceRees who interviewed people from diversebackgrounds for his recent documentary,The Nazis: A Warning from History.\nErna Kranz, an ordinary German teenager in\nthe1930s and a grandmother now,  said toRees:\n1930s offered a glimmer of hope, not just for\nthe unemployed but for everybody for we allfelt downtrodden.

The process began manycenturies ago; but under colonial rule it became more systematic andextensive.  Let us look at some of the causes of deforestation in India.\n1.1 Land to be Improved\nIn 1600, approximately one-sixth of Indias landmass was undercultivation. Now that figure has gone up to about half. As populationincreased over the centuries and the demand for food went up,peasants extended the boundaries of cultivation, clearing forests andbreaking new land. In the colonial period, cultivation expandedrapidly for a variety of reasons. First, the British directly encouraged1  Why Deforestation?\nFig.2  When the valleys were full.

The company acquiredsuch power over the governments ofthese countries that they came to beknown as Banana Republics.\nQuoted in David Spurr, The Rhetoric of\nEmpire , (1993).the production of commercial crops like jute, sugar, wheat and\ncotton. The demand for these crops increased in nineteenth-centuryEurope where foodgrains were needed to feed the growing urbanpopulation and raw materials were required for industrial\nproduction. Second,  in the early nineteenth century, the colonial\nstate thought that forests were unproductive. They were consideredto be wilderness that had to be brought under cultivation so thatthe land could yield agricultural products and revenue, and enhancethe income of the state. So between 1880 and 1920, cultivated arearose by 6.7 million hectares.\nWe always see the expansion of cultivation as a sign of progress.\nBut we should not forget that for land to be brought under theplough, forests have to be cleared.\n1.2 Sleepers on the TracksBox 1\nThe absence of cultivation in a place does not mean the land was\nuninhabited. In Australia, when the white settlers landed, theyclaimed that the continent was empty or terra nullius . In fact, they\nwere guided through the landscape by aboriginal tracks, and ledby aboriginal guides. The different aboriginal communities inAustralia had clearly demarcated territories. The Ngarrindjeripeople of Australia plotted their land along the symbolic body ofthe first ancestor, Ngurunderi. This land included five different\nenvironments: salt water, riverine tracts, lakes, bush and desertplains, which satisfied different socio-economic needs.\nFig.3  Converting sal logs into sleepers in the Singhbhum forests, Chhotanagpur, May 1897.\nAdivasis were hired by the forest department to cut trees, and make smooth planks which would serve as sleepers for therailways.

How could English ships be built without a regular supply ofstrong and durable timber? How could imperial power be protectedand maintained without ships?  By the 1820s, search parties weresent to explore the forest resources of India.  Within a decade, treeswere being felled on a massive scale and vast quantities of timberwere being exported from India.\nThe spread of railways from the 1850s created a new demand.\nRailways were essential for colonial trade and for the movement ofimperial troops. To run locomotives, wood was needed as fuel, andto lay railway lines sleepers were essential to hold the tracks together.Each mile of railway track required between 1,760 and 2,000 sleepers.\nFrom the 1860s, the railway network expanded rapidly. By 1890,\nabout 25,500 km of track had been laid. In 1946, the length of thetracks had increased to over 765,000 km.  As the railway tracks spreadthrough India, a larger and larger number of trees were felled. Asearly as the 1850s, in the Madras Presidency alone, 35,000 trees werebeing cut annually for sleepers. The government gave out contractsto individuals to supply the required quantities. These contractorsbegan cutting trees indiscriminately.

So Brandis set up the Indian Forest Service in 1864 and\nhelped formulate the Indian Forest Act of 1865. The Imperial ForestResearch Institute was set up at Dehradun in 1906. The system theytaught here was called scientific forestry . Many people now,\nincluding ecologists, feel that this system is not scientific at all.\nIn scientific forestry, natural forests which had lots of different types\nof trees were cut down. In their place, one type of tree was plantedin straight rows. This is called a plantation. Forest officials surveyedthe forests, estimated the area under different types of trees, and\nmade working plans for forest management. They planned how much\nof the  plantation area to cut every year. The area  cut was then to bereplanted so that it was ready to be cut again in some years.\nAfter the Forest Act was enacted in 1865, it was amended twice,\nonce in 1878 and then in 1927. The 1878 Act divided forests into\nthree categories: reserved, protected and village forests. The bestforests were called reserved forests. Villagers could not take anythingfrom these forests, even for their own use. For house building orfuel, they could take wood from protected or village forests.\n2.1 How were the Lives of People Affected?\nForesters and villagers had very different ideas of what a good forest\nshould look like.

Women whocollected fuelwood were especially worried. It was also common forpolice constables and forest guards to harass people by demandingfree food from them.\n2.2 How did Forest Rules Affect Cultivation?\nOne of the major impacts of European colonialism was on the practiceof shifting cultivation or swidden agriculture. This is a  traditionalagricultural practice in many parts of Asia, Africa and South America. Ithas many local names such as lading  in Southeast Asia, milpa  in Central\nAmerica, chitemene  or tavy  in Africa, and chena in Sri Lanka.  In\nIndia, dhya, penda, bewar, nevad, jhum , podu, khandad and  kumri\nare some of the local terms for swidden agriculture.\nIn shifting cultivation, parts of the forest are cut and burnt in rotation.\nSeeds are sown in the ashes after the first monsoon rains, and the crop isharvested by October-November. Such plots are cultiva ted for a couple\nof years and then left fallow for 12 to 18 years for the forest to growback. A mixture of crops is grown on these plots. In central Indiaand Africa it could be millets, in Brazil manioc, and in other parts ofLatin America maize and beans.\nEuropean for esters regarded this practice as har mful for the forests. They\nfelt that land which was used for cultivation every few years could notgrow trees for railway timber. When a forest was burnt, there wasthe added danger of the flames spreading and burning valuable timber.Activity\nChildren living around forest areas can often\nidentify hundreds of species of trees and plants.How many species of trees can you name?\nFig.14  Bringing grain from the threshing\ngrounds to the field.The men are carrying grain in baskets from thethreshing fields.

Therefore, the government decided to ban shifting cultivation.As a result, many communities were forcibly displaced from theirhomes in the forests. Some had to change occupations, while someresisted through large and small rebellions.\n2.3 Who could Hunt?\nThe new forest laws changed the lives of forest dwellers in yet anotherway. Before the forest laws, many people who lived in or near forestshad survived by hunting deer, partridges and a variety of smallanimals. This customary practice was prohibited by the forest laws.Those who were caught hunting were now punished for poaching.\nWhile the forest laws deprived people of their customary rights to\nhunt, hunting of big game became a sport. In India, hunting of tigersand other animals had been part of the culture of the court andnobility for centuries. Many Mughal paintings show princes andemperors enjoying a hunt.

The British government gave manylarge European trading firms the sole right to trade in the forestproducts of particular areas. Grazing and hunting by local peoplewere restricted. In the process, many pastoralist and nomadiccommunities like the Korava, Karacha and Yerukula of the MadrasPresidency lost their livelihoods. Some of them began to be calledcriminal tribes, and were forced to work instead in factories,mines and plantations, under government supervision.\nNew opportunities of work did not always mean improved well-\nbeing for the people .

In\naddition to the Earth, they show respect to the spirits of the river,the forest and the mountain. Since each village knows where itsboundaries lie, the local people look after all the natural resourceswithin that boundary.  If people from a village want to take somewood from the forests of another village, they pay a small fee calleddevsari , dand or man in exchange. Some villages also protect their forests\nby engaging watchmen and each household contributes some grainto pay them.  Every year there is one big hunt where the headmen ofvillages in a pargana  (cluster of  villages) meet and discuss issues of\nconcern, including forests.\n3.2 The Fears of the People\nWhen the colonial government proposed to reserve two-thirds ofthe forest in 1905, and stop shifting cultivation, hunting and collectionof forest produce, the people of Bastar were very worried. Somevillages were allowed to stay on in the reserved forests on the conditionthat they worked free for the forest department in cutting andtransporting trees, and protecting the forest from fires. Subsequently,these came to be known as forest villages. People of other villageswere displaced without any notice or compensation. For long,villagers had been suffering from increased land rents and frequentdemands for free labour and goods by colonial officials. Then camethe terrible famines, in 1899-1900 and again in 1907-1908.  Reservationsproved to be the last straw.\nPeople began to gather and discuss these issues in their village councils,\nin bazaars and at festivals or wherever the headmen and priests ofseveral villages were assembled. The initiative was taken by theDhurwas of the Kanger forest, where reservation first took place.Although there was no single leader, many people speak of  GundaDhur, from  village Nethanar, as an important figure in themovement. In 1910, mango boughs, a lump of earth, chillies andarrows, began circulating between villages. These were actuallymessages inviting villagers to rebel against the British. Every villagecontributed something to the rebellion expenses. Bazaars were looted,the houses of officials and traders, schools and police stations wereburnt and robbed, and grain redistributed. Most of those who wereattacked were in some way associated with the colonial state and itsoppressive laws. William Ward, a missionary who observed the events,wrote: From all directions came streaming into Jagdalpur, police,merchants, forest peons, schoolmasters and immigrants.\nBhondia collected 400 men, sacrificed a\nnumber of goats and started off tointercept the Dewan who was expectedto return from the direction of Bijapur.This mob started on the 10th February,burnt the Marenga school, the policepost, lines and pound at Keslur and theschool at Tokapal (Rajur), detached a\ncontingent to burn Karanji school andcaptured a head constable and fourconstables of the State reserve policewho had been sent out to escort theDewan and bring him in. The mob didnot maltreat the guard seriously buteased them of their weapons and letthem go. One party of rebels underBhondia Majhi went off to the Koer riverto block the passage there in case theDewan left the main road. The rest wenton to Dilmilli to stop the main road fromBijapur.

The Raja didnt pay attention\nto things happening around him, so seeing that land was being taken,his supporters gathered people. War started. His staunch supportersdied and the rest were whipped. My father, Podiyami T okeli suffered manystrokes, but he escaped and survived. It was a movement to get rid ofthe British. The British used to tie them to horses and pull them. Fromevery village two or three people went to Jagdalpur: Gargideva andMichk ola of Chidpal, Dole and Adr abundi of Markamiras, Vadapandu of\nBaleras, Unga of P alem and many others.\nSimilarly, Chendru, an elder from village Nandrasa, said:\nOn the peoples side, were the big elders  Mille Mudaal of Palem, Soyekal\nDhurwa of Nandrasa, and Pandwa Majhi.

The adivasi leaders\ntried to negotiate, but the British surrounded their camps and fired\nupon them. After that they marched through the villages flogging\nand punishing those who had taken part in the rebellion. Most\nvillages were deserted as people fled into the jungles. It took three\nmonths (February - May) for the British to regain control. However,\nthey never managed to capture Gunda Dhur. In a major victory\nfor the rebels, work on reservation was temporarily suspended,\nand the area to be reserved was reduced to roughly half of that\nplanned before 1910.\nThe story of the forests and people of Bastar does not end there.\nAfter Independence, the same practice of keeping people out of the\nforests and reserving them for industrial use continued. In the 1970s,\nthe World Bank proposed that 4,600 hectares of natural sal forest\nshould be replaced by tropical pine to provide pulp for the paper\nindustry. It was only after protests by local environmentalists that\nthe project was stopped.\nLet us now go to another part of Asia, Indonesia, and see what was\nhappening there over the same period."

The colonialpower in Indonesia were the Dutch, and as we will see, there weremany similarities in the laws for forest control in Indonesia andIndia.  Java in Indonesia is where the Dutch started forestmanagement. Like the British, they wanted timber from Java tobuild ships. In 1600, the population of Java was an estimated 3.4million. There were many villages in the fertile plains, but there\nwere also many communities living in the mountains and practising\nshifting cultivation.\n4.1 The Woodcutters of Java\nThe Kalangs of Java were a community of skilled forest cutters andshifting cultivators. They were so valuable that in 1755 when the\nMataram kingdom of Java split, the 6,000 Kalang families were\nequally divided between the two kingdoms. Without their expertise,it would have been difficult to harvest teak and for the kings tobuild their palaces. When the Dutch began to gain control over theforests in the eighteenth century, they tried to make the Kalangswork under them. In 1770, the Kalangs resisted by attacking a Dutchfort at Joana, but the uprising was suppressed.\n4.2 Dutch Scientific Forestry\nIn the nineteenth century, when it becameimportant to control territory and not justpeople, the Dutch enacted forest laws in Java,restricting villagers access to forests. Nowwood could only be cut for specified purposeslike making river boats or constructing houses,and only from specific forests under close\nsupervision. Villagers were punished for\ngrazing cattle in young stands, transportingwood without a permit, or travelling on forestroads with horse carts or cattle.\nAs in India, the need to manage forests for\nshipbuilding and railways led to the4  Forest Transformations in Java\nFig.21  Train transporting teak out of the forest  late colonial period."

However, all this required labour to cutthe trees, transport the logs and prepare the sleepers. The Dutchfirst imposed rents on land being cultivated in the forest and thenexempted some villages from these rents if they worked collectivelyto provide free labour and buffaloes for cutting and transportingtimber.  This was known as the blandongdiensten system. Later, instead\nof rent exemption, forest villagers were given small wages, but theirright to cultivate forest land was restricted.\n4.3 Samin’s Challenge\nAround 1890, Surontiko Samin of Randublatung village, a teak forestvillage, began questioning state ownership of the forest. He argued thatthe state had not created the wind, water, earth and wood, so it could notown it. Soon a widespread movement developed. Amongst those whohelped organise it were Samins sons-in-law. By 1907, 3,000 familieswere follo wing his ideas.  Some of the Saminists protested by lying down\non their land when the Dutch came to sur vey it, while others refused to\npay taxes or fines or perform labour.Dirk van Hogendorp, an official of the\nUnited East India Company in colonialJava said:\nBatavians!

In India, working plans were abandoned at this time, andthe forest department cut trees freely to meet British war needs. InJava, just before the Japanese occupied the region, the Dutch followeda scorched earth policy, destroying sawmills, and burning hugepiles of giant teak logs so that they would not fall into Japanesehands. The Japanese then exploited the forests recklessly for theirown war industries, forcing forest villagers to cut down forests.Many villagers used this opportunity to expand cultivation in theforest. After the war, it was difficult for the Indonesian forest serviceto get this land back. As in India, peoples need for agricultural landhas brought them into conflict with the forest departments desireto control the land and exclude people from it.\n4.5 New Developments in Forestry\nSince the 1980s, governments across Asia and Africa have begun tosee that scientific forestry and the policy of keeping forestcommunities  away from forests has resulted in many conflicts.Conservation of forests rather than collecting timber has become amore important goal. The government has recognised that in orderto meet this goal, the people who live near the forests must beinvolved. In many cases, across India, from Mizoram to Kerala, denseforests have survived only because villages protected them in sacredgroves known as sarnas, devarakudu, kan, rai,  etc. Some villages have\nbeen patrolling their own forests, with each household taking it inturns, instead of leaving it to the forest guards. Local forestcommunities and environmentalists today are thinking of differentforms of forest management.Fig.23  Indian Munitions Board, War Timber\nSleepers piled at Soolay pagoda ready for\nshipment,1917.The Allies would not have been as successfulin the First World War and the Second WorldWar if they had not been able to exploit the\nresources and people of their colonies.

The Gollas herded cattle. The Kurumas and Kurubas rearedsheep and goats and sold woven blankets. They lived near the woods,cultivated small patches of land, engaged in a variety of petty tradesand took care of their herds. Unlike the mountain pastoralists, itwas not the cold and the snow that defined the seasonal rhythms oftheir movement: rather it was the alternation of the monsoon anddry season. In the dry season they moved to the coastal tracts, andleft when the rains came. Only buffaloes liked the swampy, wetconditions of the coastal areas during the monsoon months. Otherherds had to be shifted to the dry plateau at this time.\nBanjaras were yet another well-known group of graziers. They were\nto be found in the villages of Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Rajasthan,Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra. In search of good pasturelandfor their cattle, they moved over long distances, selling plough cattleand other goods to villagers in exchange for grain and fodder.\nThe accounts of many travellers tell us about the life of pastoral\ngroups. In the early nineteenth century, Buchanan visited theGollas during his travel through Mysore. He wrote:\nTheir families live in small villages near the skirt of the woods,\nwhere they cultivate a little ground, and keep some of theircattle, selling in the towns the produce of the dairy.Their families are very numerous, seven to eight young men ineach being common. Two or three of these attend the flocks inthe woods, while the remainder cultivate their fields, and supplythe towns with firewood, and with straw for thatch.\nFrom:  Francis Hamilton Buchanan, A Journey from Madras through\nthe Countries of Mysore, Canara and Malabar (London, 1807).Read Sources A and B.\n!Write briefly about what they tell you about\nthe nature of the work undertaken by menand women in pastoral households.\n!Why do you think pastoral groups often\nlive on the edges of forests?\nIn the deserts of Rajasthan lived the Raikas. The rainfall in\nthe region was meagre and uncertain. On cultivated land,harvests fluctuated every year. Over vast stretches no cropcould be grown. So the Raikas combined cultivation withpastoralism. During  the monsoons, the Raikas of  Barmer,Jaisalmer, Jodhpur and Bikaner stayed in their home villages,where pasture was available. By October, when these grazinggrounds were dry and exhausted, they moved out in searchof other pasture and water, and returned again during thenext monsoon. One group of Raikas  known as the Maru(desert) Raikas  herded camels and another group rearedsheep and goat.\nFig.6  A camel herder in his settlement.\nThis is on the Thar desert near Jaisalmer in Rajasthan.\nThe camel herders of the region are Maru (desert)Raikas, and their settlement is called a dhandi ."

Their agricultural stockdeclined and their trades and crafts were adversely affected. How?\nFirst, the colonial state wanted to transform all grazing lands\ninto cultivated farms. Land revenue was one of the main sourcesof its finance. By expanding cultivation it could increase its revenuecollection. It could at the same time produce more jute, cotton,wheat and other agricultural produce that were required inEngland. To colonial officials all uncultivated land appeared tobe unproductive: it produced neither revenue nor agriculturalproduce. It was seen as waste land that needed to be broughtunder cultivation. From the mid-nineteenth century, Waste LandRules were enacted in various parts of the country. By these Rulesuncultivated lands were taken over and given to select individuals.These individuals were granted various concessions and encouragedto settle these lands. Some of them were made headmen of villagesin the newly cleared areas. In most areas the lands taken overwere actually grazing tracts used regularly by pastoralists. Soexpansion of cultivation inevitably meant the decline of pasturesand a problem for pastoralists.\nSecond, by the mid-nineteenth century, various Forest Acts were\nalso being enacted in the different provinces.  Through these Actssome forests which produced commercially valuable timber likedeodar or sal were declared Reserved. No pastoralist was allowed\naccess to these forests. Other forests were classified as Protected.In these, some customary  grazing rights of pastoralists were\ngranted but their movements were severely restricted. Thecolonial officials believed that grazing destroyed the saplings andyoung shoots of trees that germinated on the forest floor. Theherds trampled over the saplings and munched away the shoots.This prevented new trees from growing.\nThese Forest Acts changed the lives of pastoralists. They were\nnow prevented from entering many forests that had earlierprovided valuable forage for their cattle. Even in the areas theywere allowed entry, their movements were regulated. They neededa permit for entry.

Pastoralists could no longer remain in an area even ifforage was available, the grass was succulent and the undergrowth\nin the forest was ample. They had to move because the Forest\nDepartment permits that had been issued to them now ruled their\nlives. The permit specified the periods in which they could be\nlegally within a forest. If they overstayed they were liable to fines.\nThird, British officials were suspicious of nomadic people. They\ndistrusted mobile craftsmen and traders who hawked their goodsin villages, and pastoralists who changed their places of residence\nevery season, moving in search of good pastures for their herds.\nThe colonial government wanted to rule over a settled population.\nThey wanted the rural people to live in villages, in fixed places\nwith fixed rights on particular fields. Such a population was easyto identify and control. Those who were settled were seen as\npeaceable and law abiding; those who were nomadic were\nconsidered to be criminal. In 1871, the colonial government in\nIndia passed the Criminal Tribes Act.  By this Act many\ncommunities of craftsmen, traders and pastoralists were classifiedas Criminal Tribes. They were stated to be criminal by nature\nand birth. Once this Act came into force, these communities were\nexpected to live only in notified village settlements. They were\nnot allowed to move out without a permit. The village police\nkept a continuous watch on them.\nFourth, to expand its revenue income, the colonial government\nlooked for every possible source of taxation. So tax was imposedon land, on canal water, on salt, on trade goods, and even on\nanimals. Pastoralists had to pay tax on every animal they grazed\non the pastures. In most pastoral tracts of India, grazing tax was\nintroduced in the mid-nineteenth century. The tax per head of\ncattle went up rapidly and the system of collection was madeincreasingly efficient. In the decades between the 1850s and 1880s\nthe right to collect the tax was auctioned out to contractors. These\ncontractors tried to extract as high a tax as they could to recover\nthe money they had paid to the state and earn as much profit as\nthey could within the year. By the 1880s the government begancollecting taxes directly from the pastoralists. Each of them was\ngiven a pass. To enter a grazing tract, a cattle herder had to show\nthe pass and pay the tax. The number of cattle heads he had and\nthe amount of tax he paid was entered on the pass.In the 1920s, a Royal Commission on\nAgriculture reported:\nThe extent of the area available for\ngrazing has gone down tremendouslywith the extension of area undercultivation because of increasingpopulation, extension of irrigationfacilities, acquiring the pastures forGovernment purposes, for example,defence, industries and agriculturalexperimental farms. [Now] breeders findit difficult to raise large herds. Thus theirearnings have gone down.

Similarly, the reservation of forestsmeant that shepherds and cattle herders could no longer freely pasturetheir cattle in the forests.\nAs pasturelands disappeared under the plough, the existing animal\nstock had to feed on whatever grazing land remained. This led tocontinuous intensive grazing of these pastures. Usually nomadicpastoralists grazed their animals in one area and moved to anotherarea. These pastoral movements allowed time for the naturalrestoration of vegetation growth.

Some\nreduced the number of cattle in their herds, since there was notenough pasture to feed large numbers. Others discovered new\npastures when movement to old grazing grounds became difficult.After 1947, the camel and sheep herding Raikas, for instance, couldno longer move into Sindh and graze their camels on the banks ofthe Indus, as they had done earlier. The new political boundariesbetween India and Pakistan stopped their movement. So they hadto find new places to go. In recent years they have been migratingto Haryana where sheep can graze on agricultural fields after theharvests are cut. This is the time that the fields need manure thatthe animals provide.\nOver the years, some richer pastoralists began buying land and\nsettling down, giving up their nomadic life. Some became settledpeasants cultivating land, others took to more extensive trading.Many poor pastoralists, on the other hand, borrowed money frommoneylenders to survive. At times they lost their cattle and sheepand became labourers, working on fields or in small towns.\nYet, pastoralists not only continue to survive, in many regions\ntheir numbers have expanded over recent decades. Whenpasturelands in one place was closed to them, they changed thedirection of their movement, reduced the size of the herd, combinedpastoral activity with other forms of income and adapted to thechanges in the modern world. Many ecologists believe that in dryregions and in the mountains, pastoralism is still ecologically themost viable form of life.\nSuch changes were not  experienced only  by pastoral communities\nin India. In many other parts of the world, new laws and settlementpatterns forced pastoral communities to alter their lives. How didpastoral communities elsewhere cope with these changes in themodern world?"

Before colonial times, Maasailand stretched overa vast area from north Kenya to the steppes of northern Tanzania.In the late nineteenth century, European imperial powers scrambledfor territorial possessions in Africa, slicing up the region into differentcolonies. In 1885, Maasailand was cut into half with an internationalboundary between British Kenya and German Tanganyika.Subsequently, the best grazing lands were gradually taken over forwhite settlement and the Maasai were pushed into a small area inFig.13  Pastoral communities in Africa.\nThe inset shows the location of the Maasais in Kenya and Tanzania.\nOn Tanganyika\nBritain conquered what had been German East\nAfrica during the First World War.

They were confined to an arid zone withuncertain rainfall and poor pastures.\nFrom the late nineteenth century, the British colonial government\nin east Africa also encouraged local peasant communities to expandcultivation. As cultivation expanded, pasturelands were turned intocultivated fields. In pre-colonial times, the Maasai pastoralists haddominated their agricultural neighbours both economically andpolitically. By the end of colonial rule the situation had reversed.\nLarge areas of grazing land were also turned into game reserves like\nthe Maasai Mara and Samburu National Park in Kenya and SerengetiPark in Tanzania. Pastoralists were not allowed to enter thesereserves; they could neither hunt animals nor graze their herds inthese areas. Very often these reserves were in areas that hadtraditionally been regular grazing grounds for Maasai herds. TheSerengeti National Park, for instance, was created over 14,760 km.of Maasai grazing land.\nFig.14   Without grass, livestock (cattle, goats and sheep) are malnourished, which means less food available for families\nand their children.

Continuous grazing within a small area inevitably meant a\ndeterioration of the quality of pastures. Fodder was always in short\nsupply. Feeding the cattle became a persistent problem.\n3.2 The Borders are Closed\nIn the nineteenth century, African pastoralists could move over vast\nareas in search of pastures. When the pastures were exhausted in one\nplace they moved to a different area to graze their cattle. From thelate nineteenth century, the colonial government began imposing\nvarious restrictions on their mobility.\nLike the Maasai, other pastoral groups were also forced to live within\nthe confines of special reserves.

The\nrestrictions under colonial rule did not entirely stop their tradingactivities but they were now subject to various restrictions.\n3.3 When Pastures Dry\nDrought affects the life of pastoralists everywhere. When rains failand pastures are dry, cattle are likely to starve unless they can bemoved to areas where forage is available. That is why, traditionally,\npastoralists are nomadic; they move from place to place. This\nnomadism allows them to survive bad times and avoid crises.\nBut from the colonial period, the Maasai were bound down to a\nfixed area, confined within a reserve, and prohibited from moving\nin search of pastures. They were cut off from the best grazing landsand forced to live within a semi-arid tract prone to frequent droughts.\nSince they could not shift their cattle to places where pastures were\navailable, large numbers of Maasai cattle died of starvation and diseasein these years of drought. An enquiry in 1930 showed that the Maasaiin Kenya possessed 720,000 cattle, 820,000 sheep and 171,000 donkeys.\nIn just two years of severe drought, 1933 and 1934, over half the\ncattle in the Maasai Reserve died.\nAs the area of grazing lands shrank, the adverse effect of the droughts\nincreased in intensity. The frequent bad years led to a steady declineof the animal stock of the pastoralists.\n3.4 Not All were Equally Affected\nIn Maasailand, as elsewhere in Africa, not all pastoralists were equally\naffected by the changes in the colonial period. In pre-colonial times\nMaasai society was divided into two social categories  elders andwarriors. The elders formed the ruling group and met in periodic\ncouncils to decide on the affairs of the community and settle disputes.\nThe warriors consisted of younger people, mainly responsible forthe protection of the tribe. They defended the community and\norganised cattle raids. Raiding was important in a society where cattle\nwas wealth. It is through raids that the power of different pastoral\ngroups was asserted. Young men came to be recognised as membersof the warrior class when they proved their manliness by raiding\nthe cattle of other pastoral groups and participating in wars. They,\nhowever, were subject to the authority of the elders.Fig.16   Note how the warriors wear\ntraditional deep red shukas, brightly beadedMaasai jewelry and carry five-foot, steel tippedspears.

Inthe months that followed, cases of such fire were reported fromnumerous districts. At times only the rick was burnt, at other timesthe entire farmhouse. Then on the night of 28 August 1830, a threshingmachine of a farmer was destroyed by labourers in East Kent inEngland. In the subsequent two years, riots spread over southernEngland and about 387 threshing machines were broken. Throughthis period, farmers received threatening letters urging them to stopusing machines that deprived workmen of their livelihood. Most ofthese letters were signed in the name of Captain Swing. Alarmedlandlords feared attacks by armed bands at night, and many destroyedtheir own machines. Government action was severe. Those suspectedof rioting were rounded up. 1, 976 prisoners were tried, nine menwere hanged, 505 transported  over 450 of them to Australia  and644 put behind bars.\nCaptain Swing was a mythic name used in these letters. But who\nwere the Swing rioters? Why did they break threshing machines?What were they protesting against? To answer these questions, weneed to trace the developments in English agriculture in the eighteenthand nineteenth centuries.\n1.1 The Time of Open fields and Commons\nOver the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries the Englishcountryside changed dramatically. Before this time in large parts ofEngland the countryside was open. It was not partitioned intoenclosed lands privately owned by landlords. Peasants cultivated onstrips of land around the village they lived in. At the beginning ofeach year, at a public meeting, each villager was allocated a numberof strips to cultivate. Usually, these strips were of varying qualityand often located in different places, not next to each other. Theeffort was to ensure that everyone had a mix of good and bad land.Beyond these strips of cultivation lay the common land. All villagershad access to the commons. Here they pastured their cows and grazedtheir sheep, collected fuelwood for fire and berries and fruit for food.They fished in the rivers and ponds, and hunted rabbit in commonforests. For the poor, the common land was essential for survival. It1   The Coming of Modern Agriculture in England\nThe threatening letters circulated widely.\nAt times the threats were gentle, atothers severe.

Whenthe price of wool went up in the world market in the sixteenthcentury, rich farmers wanted to expand wool production to earnprofits. They were eager to improve their sheep breeds and ensuregood feed for them. They were keen on controlling large areas ofland in compact blocks to allow improved breeding. So they begandividing and enclosing common land and building hedges aroundtheir holdings to separate their property from that of others. Theydrove out villagers who had small cottages on the commons, andthey prevented the poor from entering the enclosed fields.\nTill the middle of the eighteenth century the enclosure movement\nproceeded very slowly. The early enclosures were usually created byindividual landlords. They were not supported by the state or thechurch. After the mid-eighteenth century, however, the enclosuremovement swept through the countryside, changing the Englishlandscape for ever. Between 1750 and 1850, 6 million acres of landwas enclosed. The British Parliament no longer watched this processfrom a distance. It passed 4,000 Acts legalising these enclosures.\nFig.1  Threshing machines broken in different counties of England\nduring the Captain Swing movement.(1830-32)Based on E. J.

The new enclosures were different from the old.Unlike the sixteenth-century enclosures that promoted sheep farming,the land being enclosed in the late eighteenth century was for grainproduction. The new enclosures were happening in a different context;they became a sign of a changing time. From the mid-eighteenthcentury, the English population expanded rapidly. Between 1750 and1900, it multiplied over four times, mounting from 7 million in 1750to 21 million in 1850 and 30 million in 1900. This meant an increaseddemand for foodgrains to feed the population. Moreover, Britain atthis time was industrialising. More and more people began to liveand work in urban areas. Men from rural areas migrated to towns insearch of jobs. To survive they had to buy foodgrains in the market.As the urban population grew, the market for foodgrains expanded,and when demand increased rapidly, foodgrain prices rose.\nBy the end of the eighteenth century, France was at war with England.\nThis disrupted trade and the import of foodgrains from Europe.Prices of foodgrains in England sky rocketed, encouraging landownersto enclose lands and enlarge the area under grain cultivation. Profitsflowed in and landowners pressurised the Parliament to pass theEnclosure Acts.\nActivity\nLook at the graph carefully.

In earlier times,rapid population growth was most often followed by a period offood shortages. Food-grain production in the past had not expandedas rapidly as the population. In the nineteenth century this did nothappen in England. Grain production grew as quickly as population.Even though the population increased rapidly, in 1868 Englandwas producing  about 80 per cent of the food it consumed. Therest was imported.\nThis increase in food-grain production was made possible not by\nany radical innovations in agricultural technology, but by bringingnew lands under cultivation. Landlords sliced up pasturelands, carvedup open fields, cut up forest commons, took over marshes, andturned larger and larger areas into agricultural fields.\nFarmers at this time continued to use the simple innovations in\nagriculture that had become common by the early eighteenthFig.3  Suffolk countryside in the early nineteenth century.\nThis is a painting by the English painter John Constable (1776 -1837). Son of a wealthy corn merchant, he grew up in the\nSuffolk countryside in east England, a region that had been enclosed much before the nineteenth century.  At a time when\nthe idyllic countryside was disappearing, the open fields were being enclosed, Constable painted sentimental images of opencountryside. In this particular painting we do see some fences and the separation of fields, but we get no idea of what washappening in the landscape. Constable's paintings usually did not have working people. If you look at Fig.1, you will see thatSuffolk was surrounded by regions where threshing machines were broken in large numbers during the Swing riots.\nFig.4  Enclosures of common field byParliamentary Acts: eighteenth-nineteenth\ncenturies.\nBased on E.

They soon discovered that plantingthese crops improved the soil and made it more fertile. Turnip was,moreover, a good fodder crop relished by cattle. So farmers begancultivating turnips and clover regularly. These crops became part ofthe cropping system. Later findings showed that these crops had thecapacity to increase the nitrogen content of the soil. Nitrogen wasimportant for crop growth. Cultivation of the same soil over a few\nyears depleted the nitrogen in the soil and reduced its fertility. By\nrestoring nitrogen, turnip and clover made the soil fertile once again.We find that farmers in the early nineteenth century used much thesame method to improve agriculture on a more regular basis.\nEnclosures were now seen as necessary to make long-term investments\non land and plan crop rotations to improve the soil.  Enclosures alsoallowed the richer landowners to expand the land under their controland produce more for the market.\n1.4 What Happened To the Poor?\nEnclosures filled the pockets of landlords. But what happened to thosewho depended on the commons for their survival? When fences cameup, the enclosed land became the exclusive property of one landowner.The poor could no longer collect their firewood from the forests, orgraze their cattle on the commons. They could no longer collect applesand berries, or hunt small animals for meat. Nor could they gather thestalks that lay on the fields after the crops were cut. Everything belongedto the landlords, everything had a price which the poor could notafford to pay.\nIn places where enclosures happened on an extensive scale  particularly\nthe Midlands and the counties around\n  the poor were displaced from\nthe land. They found their customary rights gradually disappearing.\nDeprived of their rights and driven off the land, they tramped in searchof work. From the Midlands, they moved to the southern counties ofEngland. This was a region that was most intensively cultivated, andthere was a great demand for agricultural labourers. But nowhere couldthe poor find secure jobs.\nEarlier, it was common for labourers to live with landowners. They\nate at the masters table, and helped their master through the year,doing a variety of odd jobs. By 1800 this practice was disappearing.Labourers were being paid wages and employed only during harvesttime.

For a very large part ofthe year the poor had no work.\n1.5 The Introduction of Threshing Machines\nDuring the Napoleonic Wars, prices of foodgrains were high andfarmers expanded production vigorously. Fearing a shortage oflabour, they began buying the new threshing machines that had comeinto the market.They complained of the insolence of labourers, theirdrinking habits, and the difficulty of making them work. Themachines, they thought, would help them reduce their dependenceon labourers.\nAfter the Napoleonic Wars had ended, thousands of soldiers returned\nto the villages. They needed alternative jobs to survive. But this wasa time when grain from Europe began flowing into England, pricesdeclined, and an Agricultural Depression set in (see prices in Fig.2).Anxious, landowners began reducing the area they cultivated anddemanded that the imports of crops be stopped. They tried to cutwages and the number of workmen they employed. The unemployedpoor tramped from village to village, and those with uncertain jobslived in fear of a loss of their livelihood.\nThe Captain Swing riots spread in the countryside at this time. For\nthe poor the threshing machines had become a sign of bad times.\nConclusion\nThe coming of modern agriculture in England thus meant manydifferent changes. The open fields disappeared, and the customaryrights of peasants were undermined. The richer farmers expandedgrain production, sold this grain in the world market, made profits,and became powerful. The poor left their villages in large numbers.Some went from the Midlands to the Southern counties where jobswere available, others to the cities. The income of labourers becameunstable, their jobs insecure, their livelihood precarious."

After the\nAmerican War of Independence from 1775 to 1783 and the formationof the United States of America, the white Americans began to movewestward.

Let us\nsee how they turned the grasslands into the bread basket of America,what problems they faced, and what consequences followed.\n2.2 The Wheat Farmers\nFrom the late nineteenth century, there was a dramatic expansionof wheat production in the USA. The urban population in theUSA was growing and the export market was becoming ever bigger.As the demand increased, wheat prices rose, encouraging farmers\nto produce wheat. The spread of the railways made it easy to\ntransport the grain from the wheat-growing regions to the easterncoast for export. By the early twentieth century the  demand becameeven higher, and during the First World War the world marketboomed. Russian supplies of wheat were cut off and the USA hadto feed Europe. US President Wilson called upon farmers torespond to the need of the time. Plant more wheat, wheat will winthe war, he said.\nIn 1910, about 45 million acres of land in the USA was under wheat.\nNine years later, the area had expanded to 74 million acres, anincrease of about 65 per cent. Most of the increase was in the GreatPlains where new areas were being ploughed to extend cultivation.In many cases, big farmers  the wheat barons  controlled as much\nas 2,000 to 3,000 acres of land individually.\n2.3 The Coming of New Technology\nThis dramatic expansion was made possible by new technology.\nThrough the nineteenth century, as the settlers moved into newhabitats and new lands, they modified their implements to meettheir requirements. When they entered the mid-western prairie,the simple ploughs the farmers had used in the eastern coastal areasof the USA proved ineffective. The prairie was covered with a thickmat of grass with tough roots. To break the sod and turn the soilover, a variety of new ploughs were devised locally, some of them12 feet long. Their front rested on small wheels and they were\nhitched on to six yokes of oxen  or horses. By the early twentieth\ncentury, farmers in the Great Plains were breaking the groundwith tractors and disk ploughs, clearing vast stretches forwheat cultivation.\nOnce the crop had ripened it had to be harvested. Before the 1830s,\nthe grain used to be harvested with a cradle or sickle. At harvest\ntime, hundreds of men and women could be seen in the fields\nFig.11  Cyrus McCormick invented the reaper\nin 1831.\nFig.9  A typical farming family on a Sunday\nafternoon.

In1831, Cyrus McCormick invented the first\nmechanical reaper which could cut in one day as much as five\nmen could cut with cradles and 16 men with sickles. By the early\ntwentieth century, most farmers were using combined harvestersto cut grain. With one of these machines, 500 acres of wheat couldbe harvested in two weeks.\nFor the big farmers of the Great Plains these machines had many\nattractions. The prices of wheat were high and the demand seemedlimitless. The new machines allowed these big farmers to rapidlyclear large tracts, break up the soil, remove the grass and prepare\nthe ground for cultivation.  The work could be done quickly and\nwith a minimal number of hands. With power-driven machinery,four men could plough, seed and harvest 2,000 to 4,000 acres ofwheat in a season.\n2.4 What Happened to the Poor?\nFor the poorer farmers, machines brought misery. Many of thembought these machines, imagining that wheat prices would remainhigh and profits would flow in. If they had no money, the banksoffered loans. Those who borrowed found it difficult to pay backtheir debts. Many of them deserted their farms and looked forjobs elsewhere.\nBut jobs were difficult to find. Mechanisation had reduced the\nneed for labour. And the boom of the late nineteenth and earlytwentieth centuries seemed to have come to an end by the mid-1920s. After that, most farmers faced trouble.  Production hadexpanded so rapidly during the war and post-war years that thatthere was a large surplus. Unsold stocks piled up, storehousesoverflowed with grain, and vast amounts of corn and wheat wereturned into animal feed. Wheat prices fell and export marketscollapsed. This created the grounds for the Great AgrarianDepression of the 1930s that ruined wheat farmers everywhere.\n2.5 Dust Bowl\nThe expansion of wheat agriculture in the Great Plains createdother problems.

To build the resources of the state,efforts were made to impose a regular system of land revenue, increaserevenue rates, and expand the area under cultivation. As cultivationexpanded, the area under forests and pastures declined. All this createdmany problems for peasants and pastoralists. They found their access toforests and grazing lands increasingly restricted by rules and regulations.And they struggled to meet the pressures of government revenue demand.\nIn the colonial period, rural India also came to produce a range of crops\nfor the world market. In the early nineteenth century, indigo and opiumwere two of the major commercial crops. By the end of the century,peasants were producing sugarcane, cotton, jute, wheat and several othercrops for export, to feed the population of urban Europe and to supplythe mills of Lancashire and Manchester in England.\nHow did Indian cultivators respond to their entry into the modern\nworld of international commerce and trade? Let us look at the historyof one crop  opium  to get an idea of what colonial rule meant topeasants, and how the market operated in the colonies.\n3.1 A Taste for Tea: The Trade with China\nThe history of opium production in India was linked up with the storyof British trade with China. In the late eighteenth century, the EnglishEast India Company was buying tea and silk from China for sale inEngland. As tea became a popular English drink, the tea trade becamemore and more important. In 1785, about 15 million pounds of tea wasbeing imported into England. By 1830, the figure had jumped to over30 million pounds. In fact, the profits of the East India Company cameto depend on the tea trade.\nThis created a problem. England at this time produced nothing\nthat could be easily sold in China. The Confucian rulers of China,the Manchus, were suspicious of all foreign merchants. They fearedthat the merchants would meddle in local politics and disrupt  their3  The Indian Farmer and Opium Production"

So the Manchus were unwilling to allow the entry of\nforeign goods.\nIn such a situation, how could Western merchants finance the tea\ntrade? How could they balance their trade? They could buy tea onlyby paying in silver coins or bullion. This meant an outflow of treasurefrom England, a prospect that created widespread anxiety. It wasbelieved that a loss of treasure would impoverish the nation and depleteits wealth. Merchants therefore looked for ways to stop this loss ofsilver. They searched for a commodity they could sell in China,something they could persuade the Chinese to buy.\nOpium was such a commodity. The Portuguese had introduced\nopium into China in the early sixteenth century. Opium was however,known primarily for its medical properties and used in miniusculequantities for certain types of medicines. The Chinese were aware ofthe dangers of opium addiction, and the Emperor had forbidden itsproduction and sale except for medicinal purposes. But Westernmerchants in the mid-eighteenth century began an illegal trade inopium. It was unloaded in a number of sea ports of south-easternChina and carried by local agents to the interiors. By the early 1820s,about 10,000 crates were being annually smuggled into China. Fifteenyears later, over 35,000 crates were being unloaded every year.\nWhile the English cultivated a taste for Chinese tea, the Chinese\nbecame addicted to opium. People of all classes took to the drug shopkeepers and peddlers, officials and army men, aristocrats andpaupers. Lin Ze-xu, Special Commissioner at Canton in 1839,estimated that there were over 4 million opium smokers in China.\nFig.18  The triangular trade.\nThe British traders took opium from India to\nChina and tea from China to England. Between\nIndia and England trade flowed both ways. Bythe early 19th century, exports of handloomsfrom India declined while the export of rawmaterials (silk and cotton) and foodgrains\nincreased. From England, manufactured goods\nflowed into India leading to a decline of Indianartisanal production.\nActivity\nOn the arrows in the map indicate the\ncommodities that flowed from one country toanother."

Then he forced the foreign factories to hand over their stocks of opium,burnt 20, 000 crates of opium and blew the ashes to the wind. When he announcedthat Canton was closed to foreign trade, Britain declared war.

As China\nbecame a country of opium addicts, British trade in tea flourished.\nThe returns from opium sale financed the tea purchases in China.\n3.2 Where did Opium come from?\nThis is where the Indian peasants come into the story.\nWhen the British conquered Bengal, they made a determined effort\nto produce opium in the lands under their control. As the marketfor opium expanded in China, larger volumes of opium flowed out\nof Bengal ports. Before 1767, no more than 500 chests (of two\nmaunds  each) were being exported from India. Within four years,\nthe quantity trebled. A hundred years later, in 1870, the governmentwas exporting about 50,000 chests annually.\nSupplies had to be increased to feed this booming export trade. But\nthis was not easy. How could the cultivators be persuaded to grow\nopium? For a variety of reasons, they were unwilling to turn their\nfields over to poppy. First, the crop had to be grown on the bestland, on fields that lay near villages and were well manured. On thisland peasants usually produced pulses. If they planted opium on thisland, then pulses could not be grown there, or they would have to\nbe grown on inferior land where harvests were poorer and uncertain.\nSecond, many cultivators owned no land. To cultivate, they had topay rent and lease land from landlords. And the rent charged ongood lands near villages was very high. Third, the cultivation of opiumwas a difficult process. The plant was delicate, and cultivators had to\nspend long hours nurturing it. This meant that they did not have\nenough time to care for other crops. Finally, the price the governmentpaid to the cultivators for the opium they produced was very low. Itwas unprofitable for cultivators to grow opium at that price.\n3.3 How Were Unwilling Cultivators Made to Produce Opium?\nUnwilling cultivators were made to produce opium through a system\nof advances. In the rural areas of Bengal and Bihar, there were large\nnumbers of poor peasants. They never had enough to survive. It wasdifficult for them to pay rent to the landlord or to buy food andclothing.  From the 1780s, such peasants found their village headmen(mahato ) giving them money advances to produce opium.  When\noffered a loan, the cultivators were tempted to accept, hoping to"

It was the government opium agents who were advancing\nthe money to the headmen, who in turn gave it to the cultivators. By\ntaking the loan, the cultivator was forced to grow opium on a specified\narea of land and hand over the produce to the agents once the crop\nhad been harvested. He had no option of planting the field with a\ncrop of his choice or of selling his produce to anyone but the\ngovernment agent. And he had to accept the low price offered for\nthe produce.\nThe problem could have been partly solved by increasing the price\nof opium. But the government was reluctant to do so. It wanted to\nproduce opium at a cheap rate and sell it at a high price to opium\nagents in Calcutta, who then shipped it to China. This difference\nbetween the buying and selling price was the governments opium\nrevenue. The prices given to the peasants were so low that by the\nearly eighteenth century angry peasants began agitating for higher\nprices and refused to take advances. In regions around Benaras,\ncultivators began giving up opium cultivation. They produced\nsugarcane and potatoes instead.  Many cultivators sold off their crop\nto travelling traders ( pykars ) who offered higher prices.\nBy 1773, the British government in Bengal had established a\nmonopoly to trade in opium. No one else was legally permitted to\ntrade in the product. By the 1820s, the British found to their horror\nthat opium production in their territories was rapidly declining, but\nits production outside the British territories was increasing.  It was\nbeing produced in Central India and Rajasthan, within princely states\nthat were not under British control. In these regions, local traders\nwere offering much higher prices to peasants and exporting opium\nto China. In fact, armed bands of traders were found carrying on\nthe trade in the 1820s. To the British this trade was illegal:  it was\nsmuggling and it had to be stopped. Government monopoly had to\nbe retained. It therefore instructed its agents posted in the princely\nstates to confiscate all opium and destroy the crops.\nThis conflict between the British government, peasants and local\ntraders continued as long as opium production lasted.\nWe should not however, think that the experiences of all peasants in\ncolonial India were like those of the opium cultivators. We will read\nabout other experiences of peasants in colonial India in a later chapter."

In this section you will\nread about the history of sports and clothing.\nHistory is not just about the dramatic events in the world. It is equally about the\nsmall things in our lives. Everything around us has a history  the clothes we wear,the food we eat, the music we hear, the medicines we use, the literature we read, the\ngames we play. All these have evolved over time. Since we relate to them in our daily\nlives, their history escapes us. We never pause to think what  things were like acentury ago; or how people in different societies see these everyday things  foodand clothing for instance  differently.\nChapter VII is on History and Sports. You will study this history through the story\nof one game that in India has captured the imagination of the nation for some decades.News of cricket today hits the headline of newspapers. Cricket matches are organisedto establish friendship between nations and cricketers are seen as ambassadors of thecountry. The game has, in fact, come to represent the unity of India. But did youknow that this was not always so? This chapter will tell you about the long andchequered history of the game.\nAt one time, a century and half ago, cricket was an English game. It had been invented\nin England and became intimately linked to the culture of nineteenth centuryVictorian society. The game was expected to represent all that the English valued fair play, discipline, gentlemanliness. It was introduced in schools as part of a widerprogramme of physical training through which boys were to be moulded into idealcitizens. Girls were not to play games meant for boys. With the British, cricketspread to the colonies. There again it was supposed to uphold the values of Englishness.\nEVERYDAY LIFE, CUL TURE AND POLITICSEVERYDAY LIFE, CULTURE AND POLITICS"

They were, in fact,  worried when the inhabitants of thecolonies not only began to play the game, but often played it better than the masters;and at times beat the English at their own game. The game of cricket thus got linked upclosely with the politics of colonialism and nationalism.\nWithin the colonies the game had a complex history. As Chapter VII will show, it was\nconnected to the politics of caste and region, community and nation. The emergence ofcricket as a national game was the result of many decades of historical development.\nFrom cricket you will move to clothing (Chapter VIII). You will see how a history of\nclothing can tell us so much about the history of societies. The clothes people wear areshaped by the rules and norms of societies. They reflect peoples sense of beauty andhonour, their notions of proper conduct and behavior. As societies change, these normsalter. But these changes in the norms of society and styles of clothing come about as aconsequence of long years of struggle. They have a history. They do not justhappen naturally.\nChapter VIII will introduce you to this history. It will show how the shifts in clothing\nin England and India were shaped by the social movements within these societies, andby changes within the economy. You will see how clothing too, is deeply connected tothe politics of colonialism and nationalism, caste and class. A look at the history ofclothing helps us discover new layers of meaning in the politics of Swadeshi and thesymbol of the charkha. It even helps us understand Mahatma Gandhi better, for he wasone individual who was highly sensitive to the politics of clothing, and wroteextensively on it.\nOnce you see the history behind one or two such issues, you may begin to ask historical\nquestions about other such aspects of ordinary life which you have taken for granted."

By the seventeenth century,\ncricket had evolved enough to be recognisable as a distinct game and itwas popular enough for its fans to be fined for playing it on Sundayinstead of  going to chur ch. Till the middle of the eighteenth century , bats\nwere roughly the same shape as hockey sticks, curving outwards at thebottom.

No other modernteam sport takes even half as much time to complete. A football\nmatch is generally over in an hour-and-a-half of playing time. Even\nbaseball, a long-drawn-out bat-and-ball game by the standards ofmodern sport, completes nine innings in less than half the time thatit takes to play a limited-overs match, the shortened version ofmodern cricket!\nAnother curious characteristic of cricket is that the length of the\npitch is specified  22 yards  but the size or shape of the ground isnot. Most other team sports, such as hockey and football lay down\nthe dimensions of the playing area: cricket does not. Grounds can be\noval like the Adelaide Oval or nearly circular, like Chepauk inChennai. A six at the Melbourne Cricket Ground needs to clearmuch more ground than a lofted shot for the same reward at FerozShah Kotla in Delhi.\nTheres a historical reason behind both these oddities. Cricket was\nthe earliest modern team sport to be codified, which is another wayof saying that cricket gave itself rules and regulations so that it could\nbe played in a uniform and standardised way\nwell before team games like soccer and hockey.The first written Laws of Cricket were drawnup in 1744. They stated, the principals shallchoose from amongst the gentlemen present twoumpires who shall absolutely decide all disputes.The stumps must be 22 inches high and the bailacross them six inches. The ball must be between5 and 6 ounces, and the two sets of stumps 22yards apart. There were no limits on the shape\nor size of the bat. It appears that 40 notches or\nruns was viewed as a very big score, probablydue to the bowlers bowling quickly at shinsunprotected by pads.

In\n1788, the MCC published its first revision of the laws and became\nthe guardian of crickets regulations.\nThe MCCs revision of the laws brought in a series of changes in\nthe game that occurred in the second half of the eighteenth century.During the 1760s and 1770s it became common to pitch the ballthrough the air, rather than roll it along the ground. This changegave bowlers the options of length, deception through the air, plusincreased pace. It also opened new possibilities for spin and swing.In response, batsmen had to master timing and shot selection. Oneimmediate result was the replacement of the curved bat with thestraight one. All of this raised the premium on skill and reducedthe influence of rough ground and brute force.\nThe weight of the ball was limited to between 5½  to 5¾ ounces,\nand the width of the bat to four inches. The latter ruling followedan innings by a batsman who appeared with a bat as wide as thewicket! In 1774, the first leg-before law was published. Also aroundthis time, a third stump became common. By 1780, three days hadbecome the length of a major match, and this year also saw thecreation of the first six-seam cricket ball.\nWhile many important changes occurred during the nineteenth\ncentury (the rule about wide balls was applied, the exactcircumference of the ball was specified, protective equipment likepads and gloves became available, boundaries were introduced wherepreviously all shots had to be run and, most importantly, over-arm bowling became legal) cricket remained a pre-industrial sportthat matured during the early phase of the Industrial Revolution,the late eighteenth century.  This history has made cricket a gamewith characteristics of both the past and the present day.\nCrickets connection with a rural past can be seen in the length of\na Test match. Originally, cricket matches had no time limit. Thegame went on for as long as it took to bowl out a side twice. Therhythms of village life were slower and crickets rules were madebefore the Industrial Revolution. Modern factory work meant thatpeople were paid by the hour or the day or the week: games thatwere codified  after the industrial revolution, like football and\nhockey, were strictly time-limited to fit the routines of industrialcity life.\nIn the same way, crickets vagueness about the size of a cricket\nground is a result of its village origins. Cricket was originally played\nNew words\nCodified  Made into a formalised system\nwith clearly established rules and laws\nFig.4  The laws of cricket drawn up and\nrevised by the MCC were regularly published in\nthis form.

The rich who could afford to play it for pleasure were calledamateurs and the poor who played it for a living were calledprofessionals. The rich were amateurs for two reasons. One, theyconsidered sport a kind of leisure. To play for the pleasure of playingand not for money was an aristocratic value. Two, there was notenough money in the game for the rich to be interested. The wagesof professionals were paid by patronage  or subscription  or gate\nmoney. The game was seasonal and did not offer employment theyear round. Most professionals worked as miners or in other formsof working class employment in winter, the off-season.\nThe social superiority of amateurs was built into the customs of\ncricket.

That is partly why the laws of thegame always give the benefit of the doubt to the batsman. Cricket isa batsmans game because its rules were made to favour  Gentlemen,who did most of the batting. The social superiority of the amateurwas also the reason the captain of a cricket team was  traditionally abatsman: not because batsmen were naturally better captains butbecause they were generally Gentlemen. Captains of teams, whetherclub teams or national sides, were always amateurs. It was not till the1930s that the English Test team was led by a professional, theYorkshire batsman, Len Hutton.\nIts often said that the battle of Waterloo was won on the playing\nfields of Eton. This means that Britains military success was basedon the values taught to schoolboys in its public schools. Eton wasthe most famous of these schools. The English boarding school wasthe institution that trained English boys for careers in the military,the civil service and the church, the three great institutions of imperialEngland. By the beginning of the nineteenth century, men likeThomas Arnold, headmaster of the famous Rugby School andfounder of the modern public school system, saw team sport likecricket and rugby not just as outdoor play, but as an organised wayof teaching English boys the discipline, the importance of hierarchy ,\nthe skills, the codes of honour and the leadership qualities that helpedthem build and run the British empire. Victorian empire buildersjustified the conquest of other countries as an act of unselfish socialservice, by which backward peoples were introduced to the civilisinginfluence of British law and Western knowledge. Cricket helped toconfirm this self-image of the English elite by glorifying the amateurideal, where cricket was played not for victory or profit, but for itsown sake, in the spirit of fair play.\nIn actual fact the Napoleonic wars were won because of the economic\ncontribution of the iron works of Scotland and Wales, the mills ofLancashire and the financial houses of the City of London.

Through the eighteenth century, cricket in Indiawas almost wholly a sport played by British military men and civilservants in all-white clubs and gymkhanas. Playing cricket in the\nprivacy of these clubs was more than just fun: it was also an escape\nfrom the strangeness, discomfort and danger of their stay in India.Indians were considered to have no talent for the game and certainlynot meant to play it. But they did.\nThe origins of Indian cricket, that is, cricket played by Indians are to\nbe found in Bombay and the first Indian community to start playing\nthe game was the small community of Zoroastrians, the Parsis.\nBrought into close contact with the British because of their interestin trade and the first Indian community to westernise, the Parsisfounded the first Indian cricket club, the Oriental Cricket Club inBombay in 1848. Parsi clubs were funded and sponsored by Parsi\nbusinessmen like the Tatas and the Wadias. The white cricket elite in\nIndia offered no help to the enthusiastic Parsis. In fact, there was aquarrel between the Bombay Gymkhana, a whites-only club, andParsi cricketers over the use of a public park. The Parsis complainedthat the park was left unfit for cricket because the polo ponies of the\nBombay Gymkhana dug up the surface.\nWhen it became clear that the colonialauthorities were prejudiced in favour oftheir white compatriots, the Parsis builttheir own gymkhana to play cricket in.\nThe rivalry between the Parsis and the\nracist Bombay Gymkhana had a happyending for these pioneers of Indian cricket.A Parsi team beat the Bombay Gymkhanaat cricket in 1889, just four years after the\nfoundation of the Indian National\nCongress in 1885, an organisation that waslucky to have amongst its early leaders thegreat Parsi statesman and intellectualDadabhai Naoroji.\nThe establishment of the Parsi Gymkhana became a precedent  for\nother Indians who in turn established clubs based on the idea of\nreligious community.

In the late nineteenth century, many Indian institutions\nand movements were organised around the idea of religiouscommunity because the colonial state encouraged these divisions andwas quick to recognise communal institutions. For example, theGovernor of the Bombay Presidency while dealing with anapplication from the Islam Gymkhana for land on Bombays seafrontwrote:  we can be certain that in a short time we shall get a similarapplication from some Hindu Gymkhana  I dont see how we areto refuse these applicants; but I will  refuse any more grants once aGymkhana has been established  by each nationality . (emphasis\nadded). It is obvious from this letter that colonial officials regardedreligious communities as separate nationalities. Applications that usedthe communal categories favoured by the colonial state were, as thisletter shows, more likely to be approved.\nThis history of gymkhana cricket led to first-class cricket being\norganised on communal and racial lines. The teams that playedcolonial Indias greatest and most famous first-class cricket tournamentdid not represent regions, as teams in todays Ranji Trophy currentlydo, but religious communities. The tournament was initially calledthe Quadrangular, because it was played by four teams: theEuropeans, the Parsis, the Hindus and the Muslims. It later becamethe Pentangular when a fifth team was added, namely, the Rest, whichcomprised all the communities left over, such as the Indian Christians.For example, Vijay Hazare, a Christian, played for the Rest.\nBy the late 1930s and early 1940s, journalists, cricketers and political\nleaders had begun to criticize the racial and communal foundationsof the Pentangular tournament. The distinguished editor of thenewspaper the Bombay Chronicle, S.A. Brelvi, the famous radio\ncommentator A.F.S. Talyarkhan and Indias most respected politicalfigure, Mahatma Gandhi, condemned the Pentangular as acommunally divisive competition that was out of place in a timewhen nationalists were trying to unite Indias diverse population. Arival first-class tournament on regional lines, the National CricketChampionship (later named the Ranji Trophy), was established butnot until Independence did it properly replace the Pentangular.

This was possible because Testcricket from its origins in 1877 was organised as a contest betweendifferent parts of the British empire, not sovereign nations.

This process ledto the decline of British influence in trade, commerce, military affairs,international politics and, inevitably, sporting matters. But this did nothappen at once; it took a while for the relative unimportance of post-imperial Britain to be reflected in the organisation of world cricket.\nEven after Indian independence kick-started the disappearance of the\nBritish empire, the regulation of international cricket remained thebusiness of the Imperial   Cricket Conference ICC. The ICC, renamed the\nInternational Cricket Conference as late as 1965, was dominated by itsfoundation members, England and Australia, which retained the rightof veto over its proceedings. Not till 1989 was the privileged position ofEngland and Australia scrapped in favour of equal membership.\nThe colonial flavour of world cricket during the 1950s and 1960s can be\nseen from the fact that England and the other white commonwealthcountries, Australia and New Zealand, continued to play Test cricketwith South Africa, a racist state that practised a policy of racialsegregation  which, among other things, barred non-whites (who made\nup the majority of South Africas population) from representing thatcountry in Test matches. Test-playing nations like India, Pakistan andthe West Indies boycotted South Africa, but they did not have thenecessary power in the ICC to debar that country from Test cricket.That only came to pass when the political pressure to isolate SouthAfrica applied by the newly decolonised nations of Asia and Africacombined with liberal feeling in Britain and forced the English cricketauthorities to cancel a tour by South Africa in 1970.\nNew words\nSegregation  Separation (of people) on the\nbasis of colour or race"

Since India had the largest viewershipfor the game amongst the cricket-playing nations and the largestmarket in the cricketing world, the games centre of gravity shiftedto South Asia. This shift was symbolized by the shifting of the ICCheadquarters from London to tax-free Dubai.\nA more important sign that the centre of gravity in cricket has shifted\naway from the old, Anglo-Australian axis is that innovations in crickettechnique in recent years have mainly come from the practice of sub-continental teams in countries like India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka.Pakistan has pioneered two great advances in bowling: the doosra  and\nthe reverse swing. Both skills were developed in response to sub-continental conditions: the doosra to counter aggressive batsmen withheavy modern bats who were threatening to make finger-spinobsolete  and reverse swing to move the ball in on dusty, unresponsive\nwickets under clear skies. Initially, both innovations were greetedwith great suspicion by countries like Britain and Australia whichsaw them as an underhanded, illegal bending of the laws of cricket.In time, it came to be accepted that the laws of cricket could notcontinue to be framed for British or Australian conditions of play,and they became part of the technique of all bowlers, everywhere inthe world.\nOne hundred and fifty years ago the first Indian cricketers, the Parsis,\nhad to struggle to find an open space to play in.

All\nsocieties observe certain rules, some of them quite strict, about the\nway in which men, women and children should dress, or how\ndifferent social classes and groups should present themselves. These\nnorms come to define the identity of people, the way they see\nthemselves, the way they want others to see them. They shape our\nnotions of grace and beauty, ideas of modesty and shame. As times\nchange and societies are transformed, these notions also alter.\nModifications in clothing come to reflect these changes.\nThe emergence of the modern world is marked by dramatic changes\nin clothing. In this chapter, we will look at some of the histories of\nclothing in the modern period, that is in the nineteenth and\ntwentieth centuries.\nWhy are these two centuries important?\nBefore the age of democratic revolutions and the development of\ncapitalist markets in eighteenth-century Europe, most people dressed\naccording to their regional codes, and were limited by the types of\nclothes and the cost of materials that were available in their region.\nClothing styles were also strictly regulated by class, gender or status\nin the social hierarchy.\nAfter the eighteenth century, the colonisation of most of the world\nby Europe, the spread of democratic ideals and the growth of an\nindustrial society, completely changed the ways in which people\nthought about dress and its meanings. People could use styles and\nmaterials that were drawn from other cultures and locations, and\nwestern dress styles for men were adopted worldwide.\nIn Chapter I you have seen how the French Revolution transformed\nmany aspects of social and political life. The revolution also swept\naway existing dress codes, known as the sumptuary laws. Let us\nlook briefly at what these laws were.\nClothing: A Social Hi story Chapter V III\n© NCERT\nnot to be republished"

                "text": "India and the Contemporary World\n160In medieval Europe, dress codes were sometimes imposed upon\nmembers of different layers of society through actual laws which\nwere spelt out in some detail. From about 1294 to the time of the\nFrench Revolution in 1789, the people of France were expected to\nstrictly follow what were known as ‘sumptuary laws.’ The laws tried\nto control the behaviour of those considered social inferiors,\npreventing them from wearing certain clothes, consuming certain\nfoods and beverages (usually this referred to alcohol) and hunting\ngame in certain areas. In medieval France, the items of clothing a\nperson could purchase per year was regulated, not only by income\nbut also by social rank. The material to be used for clothing was also\nlegally prescribed. Only royalty could wear expensive materials like\nermine  and fur, or silk, velvet and brocade. Other\nclasses were debarred from clothing themselves with\nmaterials that were associated with the aristocracy.\nThe French Revolution ended these distinctions. As\nyou know from Chapter I, members of the Jacobin\nclubs even called themselves the ‘sans culottes’ to\ndistinguish themselves from the aristocracy who\nwore the fashionable ‘knee breeches’. Sans culottes\nliterally meant those ‘without knee breeches’. From\nnow on, both men and women began wearing\nclothing that was loose and comfortable. The colours\nof France – blue, white and red – became popular as\nthey were a sign of the patriotic citizen. Other\npolitical symbols too became a part of dress: the red\ncap of liberty, long trousers and the revolutionary\ncockade  pinned on to a hat. The simplicity of clothing\nwas meant to express the idea of equality.1 11 11     Sumptuary Laws and Social HierarchySumptuary Laws and Social HierarchySumptuary Laws and Social HierarchySumptuary Laws and Social HierarchySumptuary Laws and Social Hierarchy\nNew words\nCockade – Cap, usually worn on one side.\nErmine – Type of fur.Fig.1 – An upper-class couple in eighteenth-century England.\nPainting by the English artist Thomas Gainsborough (1727-\n1788)\n© NCERT\nnot to be republished"

The French Revolution\nhad raised the question of equality and  ended aristocratic privileges,\nas well as the laws that maintained those privileges. However,\ndifferences between social strata remained. Clearly, the poor could\nnot dress like the rich, nor eat the same food. But laws no longer\nbarred people’s right to dress in the way they wished. Differences in\nearning, rather than sumptuary laws, now defined what the rich and\npoor could wear. And different classes developed their own culture\nof dress. The notion of what was beautiful or ugly, proper or\nimproper, decent or vulgar, differed.\nStyles of clothing also emphasised differences between men and\nwomen. Women in Victorian England were groomed from childhood\nto be docile and dutiful, submissive and obedient. The ideal woman\nwas one who could bear pain and suffering. While men were expected\nto be serious, strong, independent and aggressive, women were seen\nas frivolous, delicate, passive and docile. Norms of clothing reflected\nthese ideals. From childhood, girls were tightly laced up and dressed\nin stays . The effort was to restrict the growth of their bodies, contain\nthem within small moulds. When slightly older, girls had to wear\ntight fitting corsets . Tightly laced, small-waisted women were\nadmired as attractive, elegant and graceful. Clothing thus played a\npart in creating the image of frail, submissive Victorian women.\n2.1 How Did Women React to These Norms?\nMany women believed in the ideals of womanhood. The ideals were\nin the air they breathed, the literature they read, the education they\nhad received at school and at home. From childhood they grew up\nto believe that having a small waist was a womanly duty. Suffering\npain was essential to being a woman. To be seen as attractive, to be\nwomanly, they had to wear the corset. The torture and pain this\ninflicted on the body was to be accepted as normal.\nBut not everyone accepted these values. Over the nineteenth century,\nideas changed. By the 1830s, women in England began agitating for\ndemocratic rights. As the suffrage  movement developed, many began\ncampaigning for dress reform. Women’s magazines described how\ntight dresses and corsets caused deformities and illness among young\nNew words\nStays – Support as part of a woman’s dress\nto hold the body straight\nCorset – A closely fitting and stiff inner\nbodice, worn by women to give shape and\nsupport to the figure.\nSuffrage – The right to vote.

Traditional feminine clothes were criticised on a\nvariety of grounds. Long skirts, it was said, swept the grounds and\ncollected filth and dirt. This caused illness. The skirts were\nvoluminous and difficult to handle. They hampered movement and\nprevented women from working and earning. Reform of the dress,\nit was said, would change the position of women. If clothes were\ncomfortable and convenient, then women could work, earn their\nliving, and become independent. In the 1870s, the National Woman\nSuffrage Association headed by Mrs Stanton, and the American\nWoman Suffrage Association dominated by Lucy Stone both\ncampaigned for dress reform. The argument was: simplify dress,\nshorten skirts, and abandon corsets. On both sides of the Atlantic,\nthere was now a movement for rational dress reform.\nThe movement for Rational Dress Reform\nMrs Amelia Bloomer , an American, was the first dress reformer to\nlaunch loose tunics worn over ankle-length trousers. The trousers\nwere known as ‘bloomers’, ‘rationals’, or ‘knickerbockers’. The\nRational Dress Society was started in England in 1881, but did not\nachieve significant results. It was the First World War that brought\nabout radical changes in women’s clothing.\nThe reformers did not immediately succeed in changing social values.\nThey had to face ridicule and hostility. Conservatives everywhere\nopposed change. They lamented that women who gave up traditional\nnorms of dressing no longer looked beautiful, and lost their femininty\nand grace. Faced with persistent attacks, many women reformers\nchanged back into traditional clothes to conform to conventions.\nBy the end of the nineteenth century, however, change was clearly\nin the air. Ideals of beauty and styles of clothing were both\ntransformed under a variety of pressures. People began accepting\nthe ideas of reformers they had earlier ridiculed.

What created the pressure for change?\nMany changes were made possible in Britain due to the introduction\nof new materials and technologies. Other changes came about because\nof the two world wars and the new working conditions for women.\nLet us retrace our steps a few centuries to see what these changes\nwere.\n3.1 New Materials\nBefore the seventeenth century, most ordinary women in Britain\npossessed very few clothes made of flax, linen or wool, which were\ndifficult to clean. After 1600, trade with India brought cheap,\nbeautiful and easy-to-maintain Indian chintzes  within the reach of\nmany Europeans who could now increase the size of their wardrobes.\nThen, during the Industrial Revolution, in the nineteenth century,\nBritain began the mass manufacture of cotton textiles which it\nexported to many parts of the world, including India.

By\nthe early twentieth century, artificial fibres made clothes\ncheaper still and easier to wash and maintain.\nIn the late 1870s, heavy, restrictive\nunderclothes, which had created such a\nstorm in the pages of women’s magazines,\nwere gradually discarded.

By 1915, however, the hemline of the skirt rose\ndramatically to mid-calf.\nWhy this sudden change?\n3.2 The War\nChanges in women’s clothing came about as a result of the two World\nwars.\nMany European women stopped wearing jewellery and luxurious\nclothes. As upper-class women mixed with other classes, social barriers\nwere eroded and women began to dress in similar ways.\nClothes got shorter during the First World War (1914-1918) out of\npractical necessity. By 1917, over 700,000 women in Britain were\nemployed in ammunition factories. They wore a working uniform\nof blouse and trousers with accessories such as scarves, which was\nlater replaced by khaki overalls and caps. Bright colours faded from\nsight and only sober colours were worn as the war dragged on.  Thus\nclothes became plainer and simpler. Skirts became shorter. Soon\ntrousers became a vital part of Western women’s clothing, giving\nthem greater freedom of movement. Most important, women took\nto cutting their hair short for convenience.\nBy the twentieth century, a plain and austere style came to reflect\nseriousness and professionalism. New schools for children emphasised\nthe importance of plain dressing, and discouraged ornamentation.\nGymnastics and games entered the school curriculum for women.\nAs women took to sports, they had to wear clothes that did not\nhamper movement. When they went out to work they needed clothes\nthat were comfortable and convenient.\nSo we see that the history of clothing is linked to the larger history\nof society. We saw how clothing was defined by dominant cultural\nattitudes and ideals of beauty, and how these notions changed over\ntime. We saw how reformers and conservatives struggled to shape\nthese ideals, and how changes within technology and economy, and\nthe pressures of new times made people feel the need for change.\n© NCERT\nnot to be republished"

                "text": "Clothing: A Social History\n167What about India in this same period?\nDuring the colonial period there were significant changes in male and\nfemale clothing in India. On the one hand this was a consequence of\nthe influence of Western dress forms and missionary activity; on the\nother it was due to the effort by Indians to fashion clothing styles that\nembodied an indigenous tradition and culture. Cloth and clothing in\nfact became very important symbols of the national movement. A\nbrief look at the nineteenth century changes will tell us a great deal\nabout the transformations of the twentieth century.\nWhen western-style clothing came into India in the nineteenth century,\nIndians reacted in three different ways:\nOne. Many, especially men, began incorporating some elements of\nwestern-style clothing in their dress. The wealthy Parsis of western\nIndia were among the first to adapt Western-style clothing. Baggy\ntrousers and the phenta (or hat) were added to long collarless coats,\nwith boots and a walking stick to complete the look of the gentleman.\nTo some, Western clothes were a sign of modernity and progress.\nWestern-style clothing was also especially attractive to groups of dalit\nconverts to Christianity who now found it liberating.  Here too, it\nwas men rather than women who affected the new dress styles.\nTwo. There were others who were convinced that western culture\nwould lead to a loss of traditional cultural identity.

This difference between outer and inner worlds is\nstill observed by some men today.\nStill others tried a slightly different solution to the same dilemma. They\nattempted to combine Western and Indian f orms of  dressing .\nThese c hanges in c lothing , however, had a turb ulent histor y.\n4.1 Caste Conflict and Dress Change\nThough there were no formal sumptuary laws as in Europe, India\nhad its own strict social codes of food and dress. The caste system\nclearly defined what subordinate and dominant caste Hindus should\nwear, eat, etc., and these codes had the force of law. Changes in\nclothing styles that threatened these norms therefore often created\nviolent social reactions.\nIn May 1822, women of the Shanar caste were attacked by Nairs in\npublic places in the souther n princel y state of Trav ancor e, for wearing a\ncloth acr oss their upper bodies . Over subsequent decades , a violent conf lict\nover dress codes ensued.\nThe Shanars (later known as Nadars), many of whom were considered a\n‘subordinate caste’ and so were generally prohibited from using umbrellas\nand w earing shoes or g olden or naments . Men and w omen w ere also\nexpected to follow the local custom of never covering their upper bodies\nbefore the dominant castes .\nUnder the influence of Christian missionaries, Shanar women converts\nbegan in the 1820s to wear tailored blouses and cloths to cover themselves\nlike the dominant castes .

Complaints w ere also f iled in cour t against this dr ess change,\nespecially since Shanars were also refusing to render free labour for the\ndominant castes .\nAt first, the Go vernment of  Trav ancor e issued a pr oclamation in\n1829 ordering Shanar women ‘to abstain in future from covering the\nupper par ts of  the bod y.’ But this did not pr event Shanar Christian\nwomen, and even Shanar Hindus, from adopting the blouse and\nupper cloth.\nThe abolition of  slavery in Travancor e in 1855 led to e ven mor e\nfrustration among the dominant castes who felt they were losing control.\nIn October 1859, riots broke out as Shanar women were attacked inThe term Nadar came to be used for all Shanars\nby the time of the 1921 census.\nActivity\nTry and find out more about reformers of the\ntime, such as Ayya V aikunder , who were\nengaged in dress and wider social reforms.\n© NCERT\nnot to be republished"

How did Indians\nreact to British attitudes?\nIn different cultures, specific items of clothing often convey contrary\nmeanings. This frequently leads to misunderstanding and conflict. Styles\nof clothing in British India changed through such conflicts.\nConsider the case of the turban and the hat. When European traders\nfirst began frequenting India, they were distinguished from the Indian\n‘turban wearers’ as the ‘hat wearers.’  These two headgears not only\nlooked different, they also signified different things.  The turban in\nIndia was not just for protection from the heat but was a sign of\nrespectability, and could not be removed at will. In the Western\ntradition, the hat had to be removed before social superiors as a sign of\nrespect. This cultural difference created misunderstanding. The British\nwere often offended if Indians did not take off their turban when they\nmet colonial officials. Many Indians on the other hand wore the turban\nto consciously assert their regional or national identity.\nAnother such conflict related to the wearing of shoes. At the beginning\nof the nineteenth century, it was customary for British officials to\nfollow Indian etiquette and remove their footwear in the courts of\nruling kings or chiefs. Some British officials also wore Indian clothes.\nBut in 1830, Europeans were forbidden from wearing Indian clothes\nat official functions, so that the cultural identity of the white  masters\nwas not undermined.\nThe turban on the head\nThe Mysore turban, called peta, was edged with gold lace, and adopted\nas part of the Durbar dress of the Mysore court in the mid-nineteenth\ncentury . By the end of the nineteenth century , a wide variety of of ficials,\nteachers and artists in Mysore began wearing the turban, sometimes\nwith the Western suit, as a sign of belonging to the princely state.\nToday , the Mysore turban is used largely on ceremonial occasions and\nto honour visiting dignitaries.Fig.14  – Europeans bringing gifts to Shah\nJehan, Agra, 1633, from the Padshahnama.\nNotice the European visitors’ hats at the\nbottom of the picture, creating a contrast with\nthe turbans of the courtiers.\nFig.15 – Sir M.

What kind of clothes would you wear?\nWould they be very different from what you\nwore at home?At the same time, Indians were expected to wear Indian clothes to office\nand follow Indian dr ess codes . In 1824 - 1828,  Governor-Gener al Amher st\ninsisted that Indians take their shoes off as a sign of respect when they\nappeared before him, but this was not strictly followed. By the mid-\nnineteenth centur y, when Lor d Dalhousie w as Go vernor- Gener al, ‘shoe\nrespect’ was made stricter, and Indians were made to take off their shoes\nwhen entering any government institution; only those who wore European\nclothes w ere exempted fr om this r ule.  Man y Indian g overnment ser vants\nwere incr easing ly uncomf ortable with these r ules.\nIn 1862, there was a famous case of defiance of the ‘shoe respect’ rule in\na Surat  courtroom. Manockjee Cowasjee Entee, an assessor in the Surat\nFouzdaree Adawlut,  refused to tak e off his shoes in the cour t of the\nsessions judge. The judge insisted that he take off his shoes as that was the\nIndian w ay of showing r espect to superior s. But Manoc kjee r emained\nadamant. He was barred entry into the courtroom and he sent a letter of\nprotest to the g overnor of  Bomba y.\nThe British insisted that since Indians took off their shoes when they\nentered a sacred place or home, they should do so when they entered\nthe courtroom. In the controversy that followed, Indians urged that\ntaking off shoes in sacred places and at home was linked to two\ndifferent questions. One: there was the problem of dirt and filth.\nShoes collected the dirt on the road. This dirt could not be allowed\ninto spaces that were clean, particularly when people in Indian homes\nsat on the ground. Second, leather shoes and the filth that stuck\nunder it were seen as polluting. But public buildings like the\ncourtroom were different from home.\nBut it took many years before shoes were permitted into\nthe courtroom.\n© NCERT\nnot to be republished"

Artists looked for a national style of art.\nPoets wrote national songs. Then a debate began over the design of\nthe national flag. The search for a national dress was part of this\nmove to define the cultural identity of the nation in symbolic ways.\nSelf-conscious experiments with dress engaged men and women of\nthe upper classes and castes in many parts of India. The Tagore family\nof Bengal experimented, beginning in the 1870s, with designs for a\nnational dress for both men and women in India. Rabindranath\nTagore suggested that instead of combining Indian and European\ndress, India’s national dress should combine elements of Hindu and\nMuslim dress. Thus the chapkan  (a long buttoned coat) was considered\nthe most suitable dress for men.\nThere were also attempts to develop a dress style that would draw\non the tradition of different regions. In the late 1870s, Jnanadanandini\nDevi, wife of Satyendranath Tagore, the first Indian member of the\nICS, returned from Bombay to Calcutta.  She adopted the Parsi\nstyle of wearing the sari pinned to the left shoulder with a brooch,\nand worn with a blouse and shoes. This was quickly adopted by\nBrahmo Samaji women and came to be known as the Brahmika sari.\nThis style gained acceptance before long among Maharashtrian and\nUttar Pradesh Brahmos, as well as non-Brahmos.\nNew word s\nBrahmo – Those belonging to the Brahmo SamajFig.17  – Jnanadanandini Tagore (on the left)\nwith her husband Satyendranath Tagore and\nother family members.

However, the Industrial Revolution in Britain,\nwhich mechanised spinning and weaving and greatly increased the\ndemand for raw materials such as cotton and indigo, changed\nIndia’s status in the world economy.\nPolitical control of India helped the British in two ways:  Indian\npeasants could be forced to grow crops such as indigo, and cheap\nBritish manufacture easily replaced coarser Indian one. Large\nnumbers of Indian weavers and spinners were left without work,\nand important textile weaving centres such as Murshidabad,\nMachilipatnam and Surat declined as demand fell.\nYet by the middle of the twentieth century, large numbers of\npeople began boycotting British or mill-made cloth and adopting\nkhadi, even though it was coarser, more expensive and difficult\nto obtain. How did this change come about?\nIn 1905, Lord Curzon decided to partition Bengal to control the\ngrowing opposition to British rule. The Swadeshi movement\ndeveloped in reaction to this measure. People were urged to\nboycott British goods of all kinds and start their own industries\nfor the manufacture of goods such as matchboxes and cigarettes.\nMass protests followed, with people vowing to cleanse themselves\nof colonial rule. The use of khadi was made a patriotic duty.\nWomen were urged to throw away their silks and glass bangles\nand wear simple shell bangles. Rough homespun was glorified in\nsongs and poems to popularise it.\nThe change of dress appealed largely to the upper castes\nand classes rather than to those who had to make do with\nless and could not afford the new products. After 15 years,\nmany among the upper classes also returned to wearing\nEuropean dress.\nThough many people rallied to the cause of nationalism at\nthis time, it was almost impossible to compete with cheap\nBritish goods that had flooded the market.\nDespite its limitations, the experiment with Swadeshi gave\nMahatma Gandhi important ideas about using cloth as a\nsymbolic weapon against British rule.\n5.2 Mahatma Gandhi’s Experiments with Clothing\nThe most familiar image of Mahatma Gandhi is of him seated,\nbare chested and in a short dhoti, at the spinning wheel.

These\nwere not only symbols of self-reliance but also of resistance to the\nuse of British mill-made cloth.\nMahatma Gandhi’s experiments with clothing sum up the changing\nattitude to dress in the Indian subcontinent. As a boy from a Gujarati\nBania family, he usually wore a shirt with a dhoti or pyjama, and\nsometimes a coat. When he went to London to study law as a boy of\n19 in 1888, he cut off the tuft on his head and dressed in a Western\nsuit so that he would not be laughed at. On his return, he continued\nto wear Western suits, topped with a turban. As a lawyer\nin Johannesburg, South Africa in the 1890s, he still wore\nWestern clothes.\nSoon he decided that dressing ‘unsuitably’ was a more powerful\npolitical statement. In Durban in 1913, Gandhi first appeared in a\nlungi and kurta with his head shaved as a sign of mourning to protest\nagainst the shooting of Indian coal miners.\nOn his return to India in 1915, he decided to dress like a Kathiawadi\npeasant. Only in 1921 did he adopt the short dhoti, the form of\ndress he wore until his death. On 22 September 1921, a year after\nlaunching the non-cooperation movement, which sought swaraj in\none year, he announced:\nFig.21  – Mahatma\nGandhi in his\nearliest known\npicture, aged 7.\nFig.22  – Mahatma\nGandhi at age 14,\nwith a friend.\nFig.23  – Mahatma Gandhi (seated front right) London,\n1890, at the age of 21.

But soon he saw this\nas his duty to the poor, and he never wore any other dress. He\nconsciously rejected the well-known clothes of the Indian ascetic\nand adopted the dress of the poorest Indian. Khadi, white and\ncoarse, was to him a sign of purity, of simplicity, and of poverty.\nWearing it became also a symbol of nationalism, a rejection of\nWestern mill- made cloth.\nHe wore the short dhoti without a shirt when he went to England\nfor the Round Table Conference in 1931. He refused to\ncompromise and wore it even before King George V at\nBuckingham Palace.

Was\nsuch a unity possible? Not many could take to the single peasant\nloincloth as he had. Nor did all want to. Here are some examples of\nother responses to Mahatma Gandhi’s call:\n·  Nationalists such as Motilal Nehru, a successful barrister from\nAllahabad, gave up his expensive Western-style suits and adopted  the\nIndian dhoti and kurta. But these were not made of coarse cloth.\n·  Those who had been deprived by caste norms for centuries were\nattracted to Western dress styles. Therefore, unlike Mahatma Gandhi,\nother nationalists such as Babasaheb Ambedkar never gave up the\nWestern-style suit. Many Dalits began in the early 1910s to wear three-\npiece suits, and shoes and socks on all public occasions, as a political\nstatement of self-respect.\n·  A woman who wrote to Mahatma Gandhi from Maharashtra in\n1928 said, ‘A year ago, I heard you speaking on the extreme necessity\nof every  one of us wearing khadi and thereupon decided to adopt it.\nBut we are poor people, My husband says khadi is costly. Belonging\nas I do to Maharashtra, I wear a sari nine yards long … (and) the elders\nwill not hear of a reduction (to six yards).’\n·  Other women, like Sarojini Naidu and Kamala Nehru, wore coloured\nsaris with designs, instead of coarse, white homespun.\nConclusion\nChanges in styles of clothing are thus linked up with shifts in cultural\ntastes and notions of beauty, with changes within the economy and\nsociety, and with issues of social and political conflict. So when we see\nclothing styles alter we need to ask: why do these changes take place?\nWhat do they tell us about society and its history? What can they tell\nus about changes in tastes and technologies, markets and industries?\n© NCERT\nnot to be republished"

For two years from 1919, he himself wore the cap, and then gave\nit up, but by this time it had become part of the nationalist uniform and even a symbol of defiance. For example, the\nGwalior state tried to prohibit its use in 1921 during the non co-operation movement. During the Khilafat movement the\ncap was worn by large numbers of Hindus and Muslims. A group of Santhals who att acked the police in 1922 in Bengal\ndemanding the release of Santhal prisoners believed that the Gandhi cap would protect them from bullets: three of\nthem died as a result.\nLarge numbers of nationalists defiantly wore the Gandhi cap and were even beaten or arrested for doing so . With the\nrise of the Khilafat movement in the post-First World War years, the fez, a tasseled Turkish cap, became a sign of anti-\ncolonialism in India.
